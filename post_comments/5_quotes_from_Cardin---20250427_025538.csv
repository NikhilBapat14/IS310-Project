"I like Cardinal Sarah, but I don't think it's going to be him. First, he turns 80 next month, which is the cut off for even participating in conclaves. They're probably going to go with someone younger. Also, 1/3 of the Cardinals who are going to be in the conclave were raised by Francis, in part it has been said for having sharing his liberalism. Cardinal Sarah, on the other hand was raised by Pope Benedict, has been openly critical of Francis during his time as Pope, and is noted as being more conservative.  That said, I have heard the argument made that the Church likes to alternate between liberal and conservative Popes for the sake of maintaining balance (hence the marked difference between Benedict and Francis), and Catholicism in Africa is skyrocketing at the moment, so there's still a chance.",Briguy28,2025-04-27T05:26:36,23
The man who enters the conclave a pope leaves a cardinal.,NotRadTrad05,2025-04-27T09:40:04,7
"Just an interesting factoid. I was curious.  The longest papal election in history lasted from November 1268 to September 1, 1271, spanning over two years and nine months. This election was marked by political infighting among the cardinals and was the first example of a papal election by ""compromise,"" where a committee of six cardinals was appointed to resolve the deadlock.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-27T08:14:36,9
"The whole Catholic Church is off the track.  No way they pick a ""conservative"" pope.  Francis was an activist, so that's who will replace him.",PastorofMuppets79,2025-04-27T07:42:32,8
"Given the state of the RCC, this guy has minimal chance. They’ll go for another hyper-liberal guy.",ITrCool,2025-04-27T07:31:14,5
Sounds like he's the man for the job.,Vessarionovich,2025-04-27T08:28:20,1
