"Isra Hirsi, the daughter of “Squad” member Rep. Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.), promoted a fundraiser supporting Mohsen Mahdawi, the Columbia University student activist facing deportation over his support for Hamas. Hirsi, a far-left activist, anti-Israel agitator, and Barnard College senior, posted a screenshot of the GoFundMe with a link on her Instagram story Tuesday evening. At the time, the fundraiser had collected just over $9,000. By Wednesday afternoon, that ballooned to more than $42,000.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-17T02:03:41,1
