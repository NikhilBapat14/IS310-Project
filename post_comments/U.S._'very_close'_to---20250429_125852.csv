Let's see. Trump administration. Words = lies,Mike_Pences_Mother,2025-04-29T13:05:15,4
This will be an interesting litmus test for Trump 2.0 since the US has a $45.7 billion trade deficit with India.   If they don’t fully close the deficit (unlikely) then what is the amount Trump is willing to negotiate to?  Every tariffed country is watching closely.,Altruistic_Noise_765,2025-04-29T13:21:42,3

We're at Day 18 in the 90 days and 90 trade deals. The best the Trump administration has so far is 'very close' but no deals.,Financial-Special766,2025-04-29T13:37:04,2

Do we honestly expect much here?  Outside of large industrial items what is it we offer India that they can afford to import?  What incentive do they have to work on closing that gap?  China is right next door and will offer them a better deal with less volatility and little need to publicly grovel at the feet of their leader.,hmr0987,2025-04-29T15:07:06,3

">Do we honestly expect much here?  No but it’s impossible to predict with this admin  >Outside of large industrial items what is it we offer India that they can afford to import?  Oil & gas is the biggest play. If Trump was smart (meh), he would pursue it since it would help “drill baby drill” and reduce Russia’s revenue stream.   >What incentive do they have to work on closing that gap?  Not sure. India might want to protect its pharma industry and potentially gain access to more of the US MIC.   >China is right next door and will offer them a better deal with less volatility and little need to publicly grovel at the feet of their leader.  They don’t have a history of playing well together but we’re in a new, Trumpian world so anything could change.",Altruistic_Noise_765,2025-04-29T15:18:28,1
