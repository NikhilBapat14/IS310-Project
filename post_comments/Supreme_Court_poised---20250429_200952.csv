How can it ever be legal to search a house and leave thousands of dollars of damage?  Even if it is the right house much less the wrong one.,Only_Mastodon4098,2025-04-29T20:24:49,43

"> When Liu argued the FBI agents in the case did not violate any government policy despite the mistake, Justice Neil Gorsuch shot back incredulously.  > ""No policy says, 'Don't break down the wrong door? Don't traumatize the occupants'? Really?"" Gorsuch asked Liu.",wwhsd,2025-04-29T23:04:06,13

"This family is traumatized for life, they are surely entitled some compensatino for that even though it can never be fully remedied.  New protections need to be put in place so that this cannot happen again!",DaDibbel,2025-04-29T20:32:26,6
"Their official duty is *not* to raid the wrong house that isn't the subject of the warrant. If the wrong address is on the warrant, it is *not* the official duty of the person issuing the warrant. If the person issuing the warrant was given the wrong address, it is *not* the official duty of the person providing the information that resulted in the issuing of the warrant.   All of these are somebodies negligence and not their official duty, as their official duty is involves diligence that was not properly properly done.  Their official duty is *not* to raid the wrong house that isn't the subject of the warrant. If the wrong address is on the warrant, it is *not* the official duty of the person issuing the warrant.

All of these are somebodies negligence and not their official duty, as their official duty is involves diligence that was not properly properly done.  This ultimately is a fifth amendment and property rights issue which prevents ""the states from depriving any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law."" I see nowhere in the constitution or amendments which allow official entities to 'leave thousands in damages' and then waive the property owners right to recovering damages from those liable of negligence. If that temporary public use due to someones negligence is their excuse, much like permanent public use, the property was still quartered and damaged without just compensation.",postsshortcomments,2025-04-29T20:31:41,2

"It's because police are made, hired, and evaluated to harvest from the public. It's why they have quotas. They don't serve and protect that a lie. Their primary function is to pull money from regular people into their pockets and the governments pockets. That's it.  They don't really care about you, it's not real.",No_Day_9204,2025-04-30T02:28:58,5

"This is a new story that's still gaining traction. Rachel Maddow covered it during the opening segment of her show tonight, and I'm sure it will get covered in other places too. The video of the mom (in silhouette) tearfully talking about her family's experience is heartbreaking and powerful, and I think this story will get a lot of attention (I hope).",sachiprecious,2025-04-29T21:05:45,3
