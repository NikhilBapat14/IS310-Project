"Republicans are reading the writing on the wall.  When Trump's spirit animal, McKinley, launched tariffs back in the day it resulted in Republicans losing Congress.  When the Smith-Hawely Tariff Act was implemented, Republicans lost Congress for like 60 years.",crucial_geek,2025-04-04T09:32:41,54

They let their hatred of liberals trump all. After he got the nomination in 2016 I was stupid and thought enough Republicans would cross over to stop him.,kerryfinchelhillary,2025-04-04T09:48:12,17

First we got a mafia economy. Then we got a mafia state. We must rid ourselves of the ruling criminal class or become its victims.  https://preview.redd.it/c2esc8l0yuse1.jpeg?width=1152&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b65c45b6a4f17c660e68abd6efd8da2f26ab9d0,No_Clue_7894,2025-04-04T13:01:29,4

"In 2025, why are all these videos potato-quality? It disproves the point weâ€™re trying to make with the video when their mouths are blurry and look like AI. I know they could have found higher res versions of these clips. The ladyâ€™s teeth look like they blur and shift a bit in the third clip. In the age of AI (as someone who defends AI usually for things like computing) I question if all of these are legit. No sound quality degradation, but video quality is sh*tâ€¦.? Anywayâ€¦ Iâ€™m going to get poster board for Saturday for my signs. Hopefully everyone comes out to your local protest on April 5.",Mammoth_Tusk90,2025-04-04T15:45:44,1

"Yeah. I agree. Plus they are blind and deaf.  Itâ€™s a cult who wonâ€™t wake up until they are impacted.  Itâ€™s coming.  Eventually his Congress will turn on him for their own survival. I donâ€™t believe heâ€™s driving this, heâ€™s a puppet for certain billionaires.  They know Trump is old and will fade away; they are using him as a useful idiot.",Wonderful-Abies1489,2025-04-04T16:14:22,5
