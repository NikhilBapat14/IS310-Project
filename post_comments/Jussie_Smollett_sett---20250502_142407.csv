"Jessie Smollett must never be re-habilitated until he finally owns up to what he did. To this day, he continues to maintain that he was genuinely assaulted. No forgiveness without contrition.",Vessarionovich,2025-05-02T14:32:42,88
Hoax -> Found Out -> Charged -> Liberals find him not-guilty -> Sues city -> wins settlement.  How much does this sound like it was part of the planning?,ComputerRedneck,2025-05-02T16:02:07,63

"From the article,   > ""Today we resolve a question about the State’s responsibility to honor the agreements it makes with defendants,"" the court wrote in documents obtained by Fox News Digital at the time. ""Specifically, we address whether a dismissal of a case by nolle prosequi allows the State to bring a second prosecution when the dismissal was entered as part of an agreement with the defendant and the defendant has performed his part of the bargain. > > ""We hold that a second prosecution under these circumstances is a due process violation, and we therefore reverse defendant’s conviction.""  With *nolle prosequi* meaning ""will no longer prosecute.""  I mean, from a legal standpoint yes if they enter a dismissal agreement and the guilty party holds up their end of the agreement, they shouldn't charge again. Shame on the state for waffling.  Still, it doesn't change the fact that he made up a BS event to garner sympathy and inflame a political situation, one that I'll water people still believe, and he should have been charged on it from the start without some non-prosecution agreement.",TheIncredibleHork,2025-05-02T15:40:33,14
"Wasn’t that other liberal lunatic DA Kim Foxx involved in this too? If so, she should be disbarred and jailed too. Hell, both her & Juicy should be in jail, along with Fani, Leticia and Alvin Bragg. Preferably in the same cell too since liberals are fine with males being in same spaces as women. Fuck all these lying-off-their-asses morons. When will America wake up? Never put these liberal, racist BLM fools back in office ever again!!",142Ironmanagain,2025-05-03T05:39:08,2
