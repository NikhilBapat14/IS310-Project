"You know how the April 5th protest gathered about five million Americans across the Nation to protest Trumpâ€™s bullshit? Killing SS would make that number *double* overnight. AT LEAST double. Hell, weâ€™ll probably hit that number anyway by the time summer rolls around, but gutting one of the most popular and widely relied-upon services in America would make it happen *way* faster.  On their own heads be itâ€¦",TechnologyRemote7331,2025-04-07T18:42:32,1

My mom is MAGA and refuses to believe anything will happen to SS. It needs to fail to wake people up.Â ,femme_mystique,2025-04-07T19:41:12,1

You seem to misunderstand that we all could potentially have nothing left to lose in a few months. Itâ€™s not entirely ridiculous to suggest taking matters into our own hands when those elected to protect our freedoms fail. Iâ€™d suggest you plan accordingly.,doom_z,2025-04-07T20:41:00,1
youâ€™re being trolled.,Small-Palpitation310,2025-04-07T21:18:33,1
