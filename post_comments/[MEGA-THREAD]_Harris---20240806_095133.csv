"This is a question for the republicans here:  Was there anywhere near the adulation that Walz is getting from the democrats, for Vance from the GOP?  I ask, because over in my world, the best I saw was resigned acceptance for him. (and the lack of polling boost for Trump after he chose his VP, seems to reflect that.)",scarr3g,2024-08-06T19:06:16,9
"If Harris wins, what will happen with the first and second lady positions?  Will Doug (Harris's Husband) be the first gentleman?  Will he be expected to do stuff with education and helping kids?  How about Gwen, the wife of Tim Walz...would she be first lady since normally she would be second lady but there wouldn't be a first lady?  If so, will Kelly, the wife of the speaker of the house, become second lady?",TheLaserGuru,2024-08-06T11:29:58,4
"Why have each of them been picked? As a Brit, I'm not entirely caught up this time around.  I assume Walz has been chosen to hopefully boost support in Minnesota? Is there a specific reason for this state as opposed to others? Or is it just he has the best record?  And why JD Vance? Ohio senator seems an odd choice, hasn't Ohio went Republican for the last decade? What was the reason for his pick?",WhilstRomeBurns,2024-08-06T19:32:33,1
"> Will Doug (Harris's Husband) be the first gentleman?  Yes. In fact, he'll be the nation's *first* first gentleman. (He's currently the first second gentleman.)  :-)  He's already been [advocating on abortion rights](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/doug-emhoff-pushing-men-advocate-abortion-rights-rcna151328) for a while.  Gwen would be second lady. She doesn't get a bump up in position just because there's no first lady.",nosecohn,2024-08-06T12:30:51,17

"I can speak more to the JD Vance.   I believe he was picked when Joe Biden was still running and was going to be used to balance the ticket - to make Trump appear younger than he was.   Thereâ€™s also evidence that Trump lost in 2020 because of the swing of white (mostly male) to Biden from 2016.   If you wanted to view the pick from that angle, Ohio has large pockets of rural areas and is similar in some ways to PA (which has two major cities and is otherwise rural and suburban) so if you plant Vance in PA and he picks up the white make voters there, and Trump wins PA, he has a very good chance of winning the election.",bunsNT,2024-08-06T20:27:15,2
"Given the naming trends it makes perfect sense why she would still be dubbed 'the second lady', but to those not in the know it would seem humorous in an ironic way that despite there being no ""1st place"" (wife of the Pres.) they still only let a woman take ""2nd.""  Humorously ironic considering the only reason that's happening is because a *woman is President,* but alas sometimes we just do weird things for the sake of doing weird things.",Ent3rpris3,2024-08-06T15:49:40,1
