And when you think about it - we don't have a fraction of 1% of what the founders had when they created the country, and what they envisioned for the country.

"I'm actually surprised that Bill Gates doesn't just put a dump trucks worth of money into male contraception.  For the guys who can't keep their pants on, the ability to do so without child support or costly abortion procedures would probably drive profits.  Just improving the state of contraception in general would probably reduce the number of abortions and Gates could probably supply that kind of research money.  But anyway the debate about the whole thing seems ironic to me because men are probably one of the biggest drivers of abortions between employers who don't want pregnant employees, and guys that don't want to be fathers or pay child support. Also some nazi adjacent idea of DNA purity where a kid can't possibly be born with down syndrome or whatever.  Actually access to prenatal care and maternity services has improved a lot since the 60s, and will probably continue to improve as we understand more about the human body. It might even be possible to transfer a fetus into an artificial womb to prevent issues due to complications or treatment for the mother in the future, though I'm not sure about the ethics of that.",atomic1fire,2025-04-16T17:08:36,7
