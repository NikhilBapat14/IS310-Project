For the same reason you do not stand in arms in your country.   They believe the risk is too great and the regime is not that bad and maybe it can still change.,Mofane,2025-03-17T02:18:23,38
"In Myanmar, the government enjoys the most support in the urban cores and is fighting rebels in the rural outskirts. In Russia and Iran, the government enjoys the most support from conservatives in the rural outskirts, while those who oppose the regime primarily live in large cities. Controlling the population is much easier in cities than rural areas.",[deleted],2025-03-17T01:37:43,16
"Why didn’t you include the USA in your example? Everyone keeps saying they need guns to keep the government in check, but I have never seen any actual checking occur",Demonicon66666,2025-03-17T04:39:45,16
"You're not taking into account the fact that these regimes are actually fairly popular in their respective countries, both as a reflection of controlled internal media and the fact that they broadly reflect the values that the society at large holds.  We're used to thinking of Russia as a bully but that doesn't seem so bad to people actually living in Russia who see it as their right to take what they can. In much the same way, if you live in the US, you brush off criticism of the US that many, *many* other people have in the same regard. It doesn't seem bad to you because you live in it and it broadly aligns with your values.",HeloRising,2025-03-17T01:28:09,10
"Both have a really strong government. Both Iran and Russia has been really successful in killing off leaders of opposition, sometimes even abroad. Iran has started using crime gangs in western countries to go after critics.",token-black-dude,2025-03-17T03:15:52,3
Because Russia and Iran are no banana republics such as Myanmar who couldnt deal with such sort of issues easily.,FuehrerStoleMyBike,2025-03-17T11:55:38,2
"Man, my simple answer regarding Russia is this: it's the North, dude!   Life is tough and short for the homeless here. Try to understand, or   come visit. Temperatures are usually below freezing, with knee-deep snow   from November to March. (This year, by the way, there’s almost no snow   and it’s much warmer — hello to climate skeptics!) So, the thing is,   life here has always only been possible through close ties and   dependence on society and the state.   Do you get what I mean?   The state   builds roads, the state maintains them, the state decides whether you’ll   have gas heating in your house or if you’ll be heating with firewood.   And even at the level of local officials, the state decides which stores   you’ll shop at, not to mention schools for kids. And so — you weren’t   born in the forest but within a cell of society. The state shaped your   worldview through 100% mandatory schooling and through a bunch of   government TV channels that are free and turned on by default, covering   all basic informational and entertainment needs.   Who’s gonna head out into some frozen forest to start a guerrilla campaign?   In civilization, you have everything you’re used to for living, even formally free   healthcare, which admittedly treats worse and worse, but at least any   treatment is relatively fast and free!   So all the country's resources flow into Putin’s hands in Moscow; all key enterprises across all sectors of economics are controlled by those close to Putin.   So what? With what money   are you going to make a revolution?",Modest_RUS,2025-03-17T03:27:57,2
"Because we’re not stupid, we have already seen what so called western democracy has done to Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and Libya.  We want change not destruction.",[deleted],2025-03-17T17:55:40,2
"The true question is what would it take for a person fight against their government? Could you live off the land? Give up your home? Give up easy access to food and water? Healthcare? Modern convenience, cell phone, computer?   It is all talk for people that live in the modern world. Resistance means being primitive. Nobody is going to take up fighting as long as they have food.",ShotnTheDark_TN,2025-03-17T19:07:08,1
"We in relatively stable countries can always question why people don't take up arms in oppressive states.  While these people would probably benefit from a successful uprising, there is a lot they could lose if they fail.  There's things they stand to lose in the process even if they succeed.  It's not an easy choice to make.",RamJamR,2025-03-18T12:15:36,1
"It's remarkably ignorant of you to assume that most people in iran are against hijabs to the extent they are willing to risk their lives to end the policy, and also to assume that the people of Russia are so against Putin and the war to risk their lives to oppose him.",CamelToeJockey_89,2025-03-18T14:26:14,1
"To help you answer your own question try asking yourself these?     1. What are the similarities in the situations in Iran, Russia and Myanmar?  2. Do you assume that the leadership and Iran and Russia have no support?   3. What are the consequence of taking up arms from a risk vs reward perspective?  4. Should all citizens of a country take up arms against the ruling party if they disagree with its actions?  5. Does the situation in the US warrant opponents of Trump to take up arms?",Intelligent-Star-684,2025-03-18T22:50:39,1
"Iran and Russia have incredibly large militaries. And unlike Russia, Iran’s is technologically advanced",Y0___0Y,2025-03-17T08:41:16,1
1. Ruzzians are still very pro-war.  2. It is actually a lot tougher to wage guerilla war in arctic climates that it is in (sub)tropical climates. Even more so now with aerial surveillance being so prominent.,Intro-Nimbus,2025-03-17T09:11:06,-1
And both of these countries have old school surveillance/narc states.  Russia has  super strong of state; the mafia knows an everything.  Iran has a religious Marc state. Same things.,Fit_Cut_4238,2025-03-17T07:02:56,16
"You have, we call it domestic terrorism or mass shootings.  Problem is it doesn’t help and it kills innocent people.",dsfox,2025-03-17T11:09:18,6
I don't think the Iranian regime is fairly popular. Most iranians are becoming atheists and mosques are closing down,Sufficient-Brick-790,2025-03-17T02:07:23,-2
"Yes and no. Yes as atheism is a general trend. No, because every once in a while Iran gets attacked for no reason by US or Israel and makes the regime popular again.",balinjerica,2025-03-18T07:55:15,2
"I don't think the iranian regime is popular with the younger generation at all. Sure, atheism is a general trend but in iran its turbocharges (it is not even muslim majority and is bascially the czechia of the middle east). Iranians say the regime is anti persian and hates its persian heritage since it goes against islam.",Sufficient-Brick-790,2025-03-19T02:05:38,1
