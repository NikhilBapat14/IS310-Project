It’s those who fight against those who roll over. You can be moderate and fight. You can also be progressive and fight.  Rolling over to a dictatorial President is the one thing that should not be done. Full stop.,Luck1492,2025-05-07T10:27:39,25
"Yes, the real divide is bold action and change versus quiet upholding of the status quo or acquiescing. Americans are clearly showing they want the former much more right now.",Scarlettail,2025-05-07T10:45:22,8
"The corporate side wants to not make waves until the big corporate tax breaks become law, knowing fully it will never be repealed by Democrats just like Trump's first billionaire tax cut.",MentalTourniquet,2025-05-07T10:51:12,5
Almost like you need some sort of Popular Front to fight fascism.,NIA122553,2025-05-07T11:03:06,3
The time for moderation and Kumbaya and my friends on the other side rhetoric is over. These are full on autocratic Nazis with a 2025 blueprint on how to destroy the country and set up little mini kingdoms to be ruled over by rich oligarchs. It's all laid out in black and white. You have to meet fire with fire.,TopEagle4012,2025-05-07T11:09:46,3
>Deluzio said the old moderate vs. progressive framework is no longer relevant.   Some guys would rather invent an entirely new theory of political change than ~~go to therapy~~ admit Bernie was right.,LemonFreshenedBorax-,2025-05-07T10:31:55,7
"If you're not progressive, you're Republican.",Oregon687,2025-05-07T20:58:51,1
Prove it. Show up and vote.,Thumbkeeper,2025-05-07T12:05:46,1
Sounds like a veiled threat against anyone who is willing to work with the president.  This faction wants to create chaos and a dysfunctional government.,box-cable,2025-05-07T10:25:52,-20
"Looks to me more like he's trying to use Bernie's popular policies but shed the ""progressive"" label that he feels has been tainted.",thrawtes,2025-05-07T10:44:17,8
>wants to create chaos and a dysfunctional government  Mission accomplished and they didn't even have to do anything. The government is chaotic and dysfunctional and the Democrats don't even have any power right now.,thrawtes,2025-05-07T10:33:46,14
Trump is the head of a Fascist cult. Maga is a fascist cult. There is zero common ground between Magas and the rest of America. The only people who should be working with the Maga admin are the state level officials trying to extract the tax payer provided services the fed is supposed to administer. That's it.,ToNoMoCo,2025-05-07T10:48:10,6
The senile old clown currently pretending to be president **IS** the chaos and dysfunction in the government.,UghFudgeBwana,2025-05-07T10:49:04,4
"Yep. It's pretty smart. Framing it as ""politicians willing to fight vs. those who won't"" as compared to policy based groups like ""Progressives vs. Moderates"" is actually really smart and a better way to market a new movement IMO. Less is more.",YouShallNotPass92,2025-05-07T10:59:52,10
"49.8 percent of 2024 voters are in a cult?  No, that's not a cult.  That's a mandate.",box-cable,2025-05-07T10:49:51,-7
"Especially a movement that needs to be a big tent. Fascists operate in lock step because they're fascists. Everyone else who doesn't support hierarchical thinking does not because we're not fascists. So, we need to accept political differences as long as they're directionally congruent.  The commenter popping in to immediately prop up Sanders instead of being excited to work together is part of the problem. And we need to stop letting the problem drive the conversation.",Grandpa_No,2025-05-07T11:21:41,8
"Yup. Maga fascism is a big problem, about a third of the country are the enemies of the rest of the world.  I guess it's good for the rest of the world that Magas are destroying ""America First."" It's shit for the rest of America though. Keep worshiping the pig king through the coming Maga Depression. I hope magas feel the full impact of their vote",ToNoMoCo,2025-05-07T10:53:01,8
48.8 percent of those who voted I wouldn’t assume that’s the totality of Americans if I were you.,Most_Technology557,2025-05-07T10:55:30,7
In what world is a mere plurality of votes a mandate? Not in any real world for sure.   This is why we keep pointing out how cultishly insane MAGA is -- because they are.,Grandpa_No,2025-05-07T11:18:58,5
"You think having less than half of the country behind you is a mandate? That’s pretty wild. You seen his approval ratings? It’s not even close to 49.8%, it’s way less. There is no mandate. And even if it WAS that many people, it never was Carte Blanche to go against the constitution and break our current laws. The fact anyone can say they support the constitution and then turn around and still support the guy actively running it through the paper shredder proves it’s exactly a cult. Because anything that group says they are all about, will suddenly change as soon as Trump says otherwise. You have no independent thought. Only the walking orders from an illegitimate wannabe dictator",Green_Tomato_7444,2025-05-07T11:33:51,4
"Agreed. I think Bernie himself very much understands this and also probably agrees with it.   ""Do not let perfect be the enemy of progress"" is a mantra that the left as a whole really needs to embrace",YouShallNotPass92,2025-05-07T11:24:48,3
