"Awesome!  I look forward to hearing 'We disagree with what he's doing,' and 'If you look at what he's doing, it's not necessarily in the best interest of everyone,' and 'I cannot say strongly enough that he should not be doing what he's doing,' and a few other choice words.",yrotsihfoedisgnorw,2025-04-29T13:25:50,6

"I don't know how people don't understand.    As long as Trump supports Israel in everything, Schumer will support him.    Furthermore, these old men are not moderate Democrats, they are corporate Democrats. They only want money and the support of the rich. They think the same about the average American as Trump does - they don't care.",Mr_strelac,2025-04-29T13:26:30,9

Co-conspirators in a performance drama sponsored by your favorite corporations. Next time just do whatever mitch would do to obstruct.maybe then something meaningful will get done.,Illustrious-Fig-2612,2025-04-29T13:13:33,2

"Democrats are sellouts. They got spooked by Reagan and sold their souls for Bill Clinton.   As soon as they find their soul again (psst… it’s currently on tour across the country galvanizing its citizens to fight oligarchy), they can fix this shit. Until then they’re just the Republican JV squad.",MountainPK,2025-04-29T18:19:05,2

"If the American people had any courage like the French who pour out into the streets en mass when they think their government looked at them wrong, trump wouldn’t be able to get away with this shit, but we don’t hence Im in the process of getting the hell out of the country by the end of the year.",DoubtSubstantial5440,2025-04-29T12:58:27,26
"It's not nothing. They should also be doing more, but holding up the floor with speeches is one kind of obstruction. It's also messaging to the public. They are somewhat limited in what power they can actually exert in official capacities, so messaging to people, encouraging and organizing activism, and obstruction, are basically it. Raise the temperature and get people in the streets.  Again, they should be doing more than they are, but ""speeches"" are a big part of what they need to be doing that shouldn't be discounted.",enjoycarrots,2025-04-29T13:00:09,15

"More like while Italy burns, by the time the fire gets to Rome those in power will be dead and therefore not their problem anymore.   Goal is to walk the line between saying bare minimum for base optics and yet not pissing off their oligarch overlords who also happen to be MAGA.   Dems/oligarchs slowly learning  the mask no longer needs to stay on all the way.",GUMBYtheOG,2025-04-29T20:30:37,1

"If you say this in r/democrats you will be told that Schumer is fighting for our rights and the American people, that we need to find a more “moderate candidate” because “that’s what voters want”",Lucky-old-boy,2025-04-29T14:27:56,2

"I don't see it as obstruction since no real legislation is being hammered out for Donnie to sign. He can just sign an Executive Order put together under Project 2025. Unless dems talk about the tactics being put into place, America is likely headed into its own Dirty War just like Argentina had.",Nondescriptish,2025-04-29T14:19:24,4
"It's a symbolic kind of obstruction which has its place and time but that's not here or now unless they are going to start calling out moderate conservatives for cowering (or, more resonably, encouraging them to be strong and help at least create a pause to all of this).",yrotsihfoedisgnorw,2025-04-29T13:36:53,6
"You know how that happens? Democrats sit and watch republicans write laws to legally suppress their votes and they do nothing about it. You can’t give a Georgia voter who is standing in line a a bottle of water but Elon can give a Republican voter a million dollars and democrats do nothing about it, except make a speech.",Agitated-Wishbone259,2025-04-29T15:31:12,5
"No one complained when Van Hollen got off his ass and actually went to see Kilmar Abrego Garcia instead of holding up a badly made, last minute homemade sign",Clownsinmypantz,2025-04-29T14:17:35,11
