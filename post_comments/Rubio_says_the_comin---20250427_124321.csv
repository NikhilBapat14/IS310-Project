"Come on... There are no negotiations. Either Zelenskyy bows to Trump and Putin, or he doesn't.   I don't believe Zelenskyy will bow. He will fight for his country, unlike Trump, who will give his country to Putin for a part of the head.",SAJ-13,2025-04-27T12:49:34,9

">""Throughout this process, it’s about determining, do both sides really want peace""   Let me save you the trouble of having to figure that out. russia doesn't want peace. Ukraine does want peace, but ""peace"" doesn't mean letting russia take over part of Ukraine's territory. All that would do is temporarily pause the war until russia eventually starts up again and takes over the rest of the country -- then moves beyond Ukraine.",sachiprecious,2025-04-27T13:17:42,3
