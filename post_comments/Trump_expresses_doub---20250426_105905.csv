Trump now questions whether or not Putin wants to end the war.  He is quite the fool.,Smithy2232,2025-04-26T11:04:11,7

"The only way a war is guaranteed to end is by winning it.  The only way a war is guaranteed to be won is by superior military might.  The US has more than enough weapons it can supply Ukraine with in order for Ukraine to force an end to this war that is most beneficial to both Ukraine and the rest of the world, including Russia. Putin is Russia's greatest enemy. The sooner he's gone the better it is.   Trump's goal and actions should be clear.",HumanWithComputer,2025-04-26T11:09:46,5
"But surely all Donald has to do is talk to Putin and change his mind, ending the war in 24 hours. ",30mil,2025-04-26T11:22:04,3

"That's no surprise Putin can no longer afford to end the Ukraine war!    Russia has thrown so many resources on this pointless war that even if Ukraine capitulated today and gave Russia everything they asked for (they won't), Russia would be looking at a decade depression to get back to what it was before the war!  Russia can tolerate how bad Russia is doing right now because of the excuse of the war, but as soon as it's over, a bunch of ogliarches are going to start asking why they lost so much wealth and prestige.  Putin might be strong enough to handle that unrest, but as soon as external unrest is taken care of Putin is staring down internal unrest.",kia75,2025-04-26T12:00:58,1

"The only problem with trying to win by overpowering Russia is that Russia has a near-endless supply of bodies that Putin is willing to throw into the meatgrinder. He doesn't care how many Russians he kills to get his way so he'll throw enough men that the Ukrainians literally run out of ammo, killing them all. So we have to address the simple matter of numbers at some point. Especially since the Russian people are totally willing to die to the last man for Putin.",DisMFer,2025-04-26T11:32:28,1

When I say superior I implicitly mean overwhelming. There is a level of overwhelmingly superior military might that simply cannot be withstood.,HumanWithComputer,2025-04-26T11:55:27,0
