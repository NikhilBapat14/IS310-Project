I have amended the Amendments and canceled them all except for the Second Amendment. The only other right you have is the RIGHT to PRAISE ME and WORSHIP ME as MASTER of the UNIVERSE.,TopEagle4012,2025-05-05T05:48:59,5
"Article makes the interesting legal point that the 8th amendment bars ""cruel and unusual *punishment*"" not treatment.   So claiming that deporting people to El Salvador isn't ""punishment"" for anything they did wrong, rather it's a measure to keep the US safe -- this makes it harder to claim deportations violate the 8th.  If they actually had a conviction, it would be easier to argue for the 8th.   Of course I'm sure these nuances are lost on Trump but he does still have a few monsters on his side who know the law and this is likely part of what's keeping the deportations and detentions in El Salvador going.",NinjaLanternShark,2025-05-05T06:52:12,5
