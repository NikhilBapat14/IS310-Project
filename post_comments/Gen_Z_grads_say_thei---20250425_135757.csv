"It’s not even just AI. A bunch of businesses now think that you need 2-3 years experience for you to even be considered to do the most entry level job and it’s pretty fucked up tbh. Oh and those same people saying that didn’t have to go through that either.   I had to take care of a family member (who gladly beat her cancer) so I didn’t take a cybersecurity job when the market was hot 2 years ago. Now I’m being told by the same people who went to cybersecurity school with me that I don’t have enough experience when they got jobs with the same experience as me.   So where am I supposed to find that or get experience? Is it in the room with us ? My certification does literally nothing even though it’s a decent one. I also love applying to internships with over 100 people applying it’s absolutely pissah.   Right now I’m in the process of possibly getting a job working assembly at a defense company I hopefully can move up later into an actual role with my skills in mind. That being said to say I don’t have spite, anger, and general disdain for how things are as a Gen Z dude would be a lie. It certainly has changed how I view the people older than me.   Additionally, saying just learn a trade bro when someone has paid for an education and worked really hard to do so is just as bad as people saying learn to code to steel workers, automobile factory workers, and miners.",Derp2638,2025-04-25T15:22:44,350

"Plenty of work in manufacturing, if you understand engineering, business, or science.  Hell, you can start on “the line” with a HS degree and the plant will PAY for your degree if you show promise, and then pay you more after you gain a relevant degree for your line of work.  Just want to throw something other than “trades bro” out there. Not everyone needs to be installing toilets, building houses, pulling wires.",Deathgripsugar,2025-04-25T14:58:55,67

"This is a bit off topic, so I apologize in advance. But why do articles and largely society in general ignore Gen X?  We're a pretty large group.

"I worked on an IT degree (I thought I was gonna code video games) for nearly 4 years. But I started a computer repair business halfway through the third year and didn't finish the degree.  I've been fixing computers (and other related tech) for 21 years now. When I started out, I was charging $20 an hour, now I'm at $70 and am supporting my family (wife and a four year old). I love my job... and the nice thing is that AI doesn't have hands.  Things sure would have been different if I'd gotten work in my actual field. I did code a few programs on my own... an enhanced web editor, and a Rabbit Pedigree Compiler (originally made to help out my Mom's hobby at the time). I sold copies of the second one!  But ultimately, very little of what I learned in school has actually applied to my day-to-day job. That's cool, though. It's (mostly) fun and I don't have a boss to deal with. (Unless you count clients. But that's not all the same thing.)  Anyway... computer repair IS in demand, especially the kind I do. Most of the businesses doing it have gone completely to Monthly Payment Plans, where you basically hire them as full-time IT support. The ""break-fix"" work that I do is an industry barely being serviced, except by Best Buy types, and they charge a ridiculous amount (I believe they're over $150 per hour now). But residential and small business clients NEED this industry. They can't afford a monthly subscription.  The other competitors I've had have all tried to open physical stores. But I run my business out of my house and mostly do my work on-site. I get the occasional drop-off, but most of my advertising is actually in print. I also get business from Google, Nextdoor, my business networking group, and word of mouth.  Point is... it's a low overhead job if you do it right and its in demand. You just need patience to let the business grow, undercharge the corporate competition, and do good work.",Swiftbow1,2025-04-26T00:55:38,12
"Part of the problem is that the market is saturated with workers. Because of this and the creep of education baseline from so many people going to college, the standards of hiring have drastically moved upward. You're right, entry level positions don't offer a job to get your foot in the door anymore.  But where I diverge from the outlook here is that, no matter what time period you look at, the real way to get a job is through networking and good old fashioned nepotism. In an oversaturated market where there are hundreds upon hundreds of people that meet qualifications; the one that gets hired is the one that the hiring manager likes/already knows.  Also as an aside: Right now the get hired into a lower position to work my way into a higher position will add an additional 5-10 years to get where you wanted to start at. If you're an assembler or a technician in the defense sector, you will not be considered for higher tier positions without a lot of friends and a lot of experience to show you aren't ""just an assembler"". Businesses look at your last job as a judgement keystone on your value. Right now you're a cybersecurity person with a 2 year gap. After you work as an assembler...you're gonna be looked at as an assembler.",Sangmund_Froid,2025-04-26T13:33:22,4
"Depends on the job. If you want to be a doctor then you absolutely need a degree. If you want to be a programmer then honestly you're better off just doing things for a few years instead of getting a degree. A portfolio is way more valuable here. The problem is that the system lies to people and claims that you always need a degree simply because they want to make money off of you by either you paying them, or them receiving funding from various sources, or both. Nobody gives a fuck about your future, it's all about money, only your parents care.",Beautiful_Crow4049,2025-04-26T12:51:07,3
I'm gonna be real with you. You have a two year gap on your resume. That's a huge red flag even if it was well intentioned. You can't blame your situation on being gen Z because your peers got jobs in their field. Employers have every right to question your gap.,BlackScienceManTyson,2025-04-26T05:54:15,8

"Yes, I came here to say this.   We have a papermill near us.   Entry level jobs just require high school and pay more than $20/hr to start and we are in a very poor low cost of living area.

Yes anyone panicking and wanting to regulate AI is very short sighted. The US will come out on top with AI because most of us have attitudes that we will use it to our advantage instead of regulating it to the ground.,kaytin911,2025-04-25T16:19:47,15

"This is something people overlook too. They also overlook how long it takes to get a license and go from grunt to actual licensed established tradesmen.   Additionally, they like to ignore that most trades can be quite heavy on the body overtime.   My buddy is an awesome electrician. It’s taken him years to get his journeyman’s license. He makes good money working for a local electrician company but I wouldn’t say it’s amazing money. He also at times has to do some fairly heavy work.",Derp2638,2025-04-25T16:23:01,88

"We have access to graduate-level reasoning, with PhD-level reasoning being almost here. We have an AI - o3 - with an IQ of 140, last year the best was 95.
