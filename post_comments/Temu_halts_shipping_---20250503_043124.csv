"Who' gonna cut the offshore accounts loopholes that the ultra-wealthy and corporations use?  Instead, they go after taxing the regular folk and innovators",prajwas2004,2025-05-03T04:38:03,23
"Also, I noticed that AliExpress is now adding extra charges, doubling the price of electronic modules due to the end of the de minimis threshold.  I guess only Howard Nutlick and Tim Cook get to enjoy those sweet exemptions.  Somebody ask Trump and 1diot Navarro where we're supposed to get these modules now. I’m not paying 3x–4x for American-made alternatives.  They know full well that even with tariffs, these imports would still be cheaper than most domestic options. This isn't about leveling the field — it’s about quietly taxing people without calling it a tax.  I’m putting purchases on hold for now and looking into whether any tax deductions apply if I’m forced to eat these new costs.  I'm pretty sure a lot of delivery workers are going to get hit by this too.  They’ve made it personal. I’ll be doing my part come election time to vote this kind of policymaking out of power.",prajwas2004,2025-05-03T04:34:34,11

"‘In September of 2024, 126 House Democrats signed a letter urging then-President Joe Biden to end the de minimis exemption for China. The letter, signed by both more centrist and progressive Democrats, claimed the influx of cheap goods from China “threaten U.S. manufacturers, hurt union workers and local retailers, and expose American consumers to great risk by flooding the market with fake and sometimes dangerous imported goods, including fentanyl and precursor chemicals from China.”   https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/what-the-end-of-the-de-minimis-exemption-could-mean-for-your-online-orders",FaithlessnessDull336,2025-05-03T04:37:05,1

"I'll be voting to get these turds out of office as well, and may run for local office myself - if Trump can be POTUS I could certainly be on the county board or school board, etc.",justtakeapill,2025-05-03T04:38:04,10
"Punishing the average person who’s not buying fentanyl precursors, just trying to get an ESP32 or a motor driver - that’s the real collateral damage here.  If safety was the concern, they could’ve targeted specific categories or blacklisted vendors. But this was about revenue, plain and simple. And it's working. prices have doubled overnight, and American alternatives still cost 3- 4x more.  Meanwhile, the big companies will still get exemptions or know how to route around these rules - and they’ll keep the tools of innovation to themselves while the rest of us get priced out.  You don’t protect jobs or safety by nuking access to global parts. You just push more people to stop building, stop learning, or go underground.  Anyone in either party pushing policies like this needs to be voted out. They’re not defending the economy - they’re choking it.",prajwas2004,2025-05-03T04:46:44,15
"Tariffs used to mostly be 7.5% for what most Americans would buy, that's a perfectly manageable tariff, for instance a $50 order amounts to a $3.75 tariff charge, personally I always felt the de minimis exemption was astronomically high, probably should have been brought down to a $100-200 range.  But that's not what's happening now and to cherry pick articles while ignoring the bigger picture is just asinine.",FlyingRock,2025-05-03T08:27:42,4
"Correct, however they weren’t taxing folks an additional 145% in the form of tariffs.",berytoot,2025-05-03T13:37:21,1
"Yeah, sure, some of Temu’s stuff is crap, but let’s not pretend Amazon’s third-party sellers aren’t pumping out the same at a higher price. At least with Temu, you're not paying the middleman surcharge and Jeff Bezos' next yacht in one click.  Also, once they kill off the competition with tariff changes, watch how fast those $3 junk tools become $12 ""Amazon's Choice"" must-haves. Same plastic, fancier box.  And look, if crap = questionable reliability, laughable depreciation, and interiors that feel like a 2005 rental, then congratulations, you’ve just described half the American car market.   You’re not exactly making a strong case for buying American ;)",prajwas2004,2025-05-03T07:05:15,7
