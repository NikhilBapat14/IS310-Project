"No, because North Korea is not really capable of swooping in any case.  The USA won't let it and barring some **radical** major changes in Chinese policy, neither would China.",Naliamegod,2023-05-15T17:42:30,11
"I think we're not really at a point where ""total collapse due to low birth rates"" is a realistic worry for *any* country in the world.  You're talking about a problem that has a time span in terms of centuries and, as others have pointed out, North Korea's ability to ""swoop in"" is questionable.   They have capable artillery but their offensive capacity is...highly limited.   An advantage in numbers is useful only in a limited context. I know ""quantity has a quality all its own"" is a catchy bumper sticker but whenever quantity meets quality, quantity almost always loses. Even if South Korea has a much smaller population, they're infinitely better equipped to repel an invasion even if that invasion is numerically much larger owing to the yawning chasm between the respective military capabilities of the North and South.",HeloRising,2023-05-21T04:15:12,3
"As far as I know, no state in modern history has ever ""collapsed"" because of low fertility rates. Fertility rates rise and fall, and trends don't continue forever; eventually, the fertility rate will stop declining, and that is likely to be well before South Korea reaches the point of there are not enough people for it to function. That is not to say that declining fertility rates are not a problem. But there are lots of things that can be done to combat it or compensate for it.",loselyconscious,2023-05-16T04:19:26,7
"No, North Korea does not have the logistical capacities to move beyond their own borders. They may talk a big game about wanting to reunify the penninsula but in reality they don't want it because of their lack of capacity",SnooBooks1701,2023-05-19T04:11:15,3
"Other people have already said no, but another point why it's definitely no is because it cannot be their strategy when the DPRK has zero control over the birthrates in the ROK.  I don't think a war between those two will ever happen. Nobody there wants to kill people/citizens of the other side, even though they are split they still see themselves as Koreans. Just with a different government.",Hapsbum,2023-05-23T09:30:51,2

"That's a late reply :D   But the situation was different, the country was just split and the south was ruled by a fascist dictatorship that committed massacres against its own population. They revolted and the north helped/intervened.",Hapsbum,2023-06-21T12:01:04,2
