"This is an area where voters don't really understand how legislating works. The result is everyone thinks passing a single issue bill makes a lot of sense, but if you actually understand how legislating works, then it really doesn't. And that results in voters thinking Congress sucks, when really they don't suck (for the reasons voters think they do at least). Let's get into it.  One factor here is that the single issues you're focusing on are not issues that do have broad support by both parties. The Reps don't want to extend the Child Tax Credit. Nor do they want to do away with the Carried Interest loophole. So you're starting at a position where there aren't enough votes do these things even if there is only one thing we're focusing on.   So how do we get more people to vote for this thing? You're not going to convince the Reps to change their policy position. The only way that happens is if Rep voters force their representatives to change. But that's not happening.  So instead, you just make it worth their while to compromise. Instead of just passing the CTC, you pass a bill that extends the CTC but also does something the Reps want. They're going to ask for a few things, and then you suggest if the Reps want all those things, then the Dems have a few things they want to do on those issues as well, and if we're negotiating compromise, we might as well negotiate compromise. Pretty soon, this bill that was originally designed to address a single issue has turned into an omnibus bill because you need multiple facets involved to get different things to compromise back and forth on.  We do see bills that have bipartisan appeal pass more easily without being big omnibus bills. For example, look at the recent gun control bill passed by Biden. That was a bill that had broad support across the parties and it passed without bundling in a bunch of other stuff.",mormagils,2022-08-19T11:07:40,5
"Classically, you would bundle a number of different policies into the same build to create support for it. Maybe New York doesn't particular want a tax subsidy for automatic weapons but it really wants a tax subsidy for live theatre. On the other hand, Montana is the reverse. By putting these in the same bill, you can get support from both states where the individual bills would have only gotten support from one.  In the modern day, it's more about the reconciliation process. The way reconciliation works is that it only requires 50 votes (in the Senate) to pass while a standard bill would require 60 votes to overcome a potential filibuster. So for any controversial partisan legislation, you need to use the reconciliation process. However, while you can introduce as many standard bills as you like, you generally only get one shot at reconciliation. So you need to pack everything into a single bill to take advantage of reconciliation.",ViskerRatio,2022-08-19T13:00:59,2
"Well right now the only things getting passed are big fiscal packages because theyâ€™re the only things that circumvent the filibuster that Democrats refuse to do away with, and Republicans pretty much 100% refuse to vote outside party lines.  Once the midterms are over and we have a new dynamic, who knows",willowdove01,2022-08-19T07:45:54,1
"To add to this, the negotiating happens within the parties as well.  [As this Stack Exchange answer explains](https://politics.stackexchange.com/a/74807/35591), everybody uses everything as leverage when they can reasonably get away with it. Candidates further towards the edges may vote for moderate proposals in exchange for concessions on their own interests.   This is why you'll frequently see bills stall out even when that party seemingly has the votes to pass whatever they want.",craftworkbench,2022-08-19T14:39:48,1
