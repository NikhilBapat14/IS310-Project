"It was cool watching this guy use the last inch of his spine and the last ounce of his patriotism to certify the election. Too bad our current vice president won't have such qualms, makes Pence look like a dream.",orange4zion,2025-05-05T18:25:16,17
"But then, Glorious Leader seems to have wanted Pence unliving.",Still_Mix3277,2025-05-05T18:20:28,7
"I'm glad Pence is openly rebuking Trump. It's interesting to see how January 6 was really his awakening moment to get out of the Trump cycle of sycophantcy and to recognize that what he is doing isn't even conservatism anymore, just pure chaos and destruction.   I mean I still don't like Pence for standing by Trump during his first term, which included COVID, but I'm glad he is attempting to redeem himself for that, like genuinely.",Ok-Excuse1771,2025-05-05T18:23:43,7
It’s amazing how these republicans can grow somewhat of a spine once they’re out of Cheetos sphere. Weird.,tacs97,2025-05-05T19:25:03,2

We got the Pence vote.,dearth_karmic,2025-05-05T18:24:14,1
"They're setting up to throw Trump under the bus when the economy starts tanking hard to try and mitigate mid-term damage, but there will be no mitigating where we will be in 18 months of this nonsense.",theombudsmen,2025-05-05T18:36:24,1
spine? lol nah.  Pence knew VP was only there for decoration. VP can't stop the certification even if he wanted to.,wizgset27,2025-05-05T18:49:02,3
"It’s too little too late. He barely said anything during the campaign, when it would have been potentially helpful. He’s just trying to rehab his health mage for personal gain,  not for any moral or patriotic reason.",trippedme77,2025-05-05T18:34:46,9
"I mean yea but you got to realize the Republican party has people who will burn houses for political opinions they don't like. Mitt Romney had to pay like 800k just for house security so that he could vote to impeach Trump, and like he's completely out of the political sphere of knowledge now. It's genuinely difficult to stand up to a Fascist ruler when they threaten your life with their people on a daily basis.",Ok-Excuse1771,2025-05-05T20:00:20,3
