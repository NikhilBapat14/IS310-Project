"From reporter Alanna Vagianos:  Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced a law on Tuesday to restrict the abortion pill mifepristone, citing an anti-abortion junk science report that has been making the rounds in conservative media.  The “[Restoring Safeguard for Dangerous Abortion Drugs Act](https://www.hawley.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Hawley-Restoring-Safeguards-for-Dangerous-Abortion-Drugs-Act.pdf)” aims to restrict mifepristone by reinstating 2011 Food and Drug Administration rules around the medication.       Those rules, loosened by the Biden and Obama administrations, would limit who can prescribe mifepristone and require in-person visits for abortion pills — effectively banning telemedicine for abortion, which now accounts for [20% of all abortions](https://msmagazine.com/2024/08/13/abortion-pills-increase-mifepristone-telehealth/) in the U.S. It would also mandate in-person follow-up visits and further limit how far into pregnancy mifepristone can be prescribed.

"Mail order drugs blow my mind. If drugs are so dangerous that they require a prescription, that means you need to validate with a form of ID that proves the person picking them up is who they are for.  Mail order doesn’t do this. How are any drugs delivered this way?  Prescription drug stores should be able to do deliveries, as long as they check IDs when they are dropping off the drugs. This would solve the delivery necessity for patients who can’t go to the drug store.",foochacho,2025-05-07T17:22:02,-8
