"Proving that he is just the same as the people he's now criticizing. The one thing that unites them all is that it's never their fault. They always believe whatever they need to believe to pretend to themselves that they are good people despite saying and doing things that harm others. This bad faith, the notion that they don't have a choice and are not responsible, is crucial to reactionary thought. It provides the facade around the selfishness and exceptionalism that motivates it al by allowing them to pretend that the social hierarchy they crave is also a moral one.",barryvm,2025-05-02T15:23:37,3
