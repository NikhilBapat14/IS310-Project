"A constitutional crisis isn't just ""someone did a bad thing"".  It's defined as a situation from which there is no legal resolution.  For example, if the president does something illegal, if the Supreme Court orders them to stop, if they refuse to stop and have enough support among the executive branch and law enforcement to keep the act going, and if Congress refuses to impeach them, then you have a constitutional crisis, because there is literally no path within the existing legal or constitutional system to resolve the problem.  Either the president continues to break the law, or someone breaks the law to remove the president from power.  By definition, whatever happens next will be illegal, no matter what it is, even if it results in the situation being resolved and legality being restored.  By definition, there is no legal way either to prevent or to resolve a constitutional crisis.  It is a moment where the legal system in the country has, in a fundamental way, failed.  The only thing you can hope for is that people act illegally in a way that it restores a state where the country's legal system can then resume and take it from there.",GabuEx,2025-03-24T04:47:36,150
"Part of the reason for our current situation is that Congress has willfully bent its knee to the executive branch. The Founders assumed this wouldn't happen because each branch would be self-nterested in preserving their own power. However today Congressional members are loyal to their Parties and ignore to their constituents.   Article One, Section 2, Clause 3 of the Constitution states: ""The Number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty Thousand, but each State shall have at Least one Representative; ""  The Reapportionment Act of 1929 capped the number of representatives in the House at 435. At the time each member of the House represented an average of 275k constituents. Today the average size of a House district is 760k with the largest reaching a million.   The Reapportionment Act of 1929 was NOT a Constitutional Amendment. Congress has the power to change it with a simple majority vote in the House, 60 votes in the Senate (if there is a filibuster), and Presidential signature.   Uncapping the House would help combat gerrymandering and make representation my localized and proportional. Having more representatives would also make it more difficult to buy members of Congress. Musk can afford to finance primary challenges against a couple hundred members. Musk wouldn't be able to afford to primary a couple thousand.   UK's House of Commons has 650 members. That is a representative per 100k. In the U.S. a similar proportion would mean the House would need around 3,300 members. That is how dramatically under-served we (USA) are by House representatives relative to similar Democracies. If each District was just 100k House members might actually be able to meet and have town halls with a bulk of their constituents.",8to24,2025-03-24T06:28:26,39

Genossenschaft theory v. imprimatur doctrine  Date Published: November 24, 2018 Let’s start with the undeniable premise that a corporation is an artificial being created by operation of law. It owes its life to the state, its birth being purely dependent on its will. As Berle so aptly stated: “Classically, a corporation was conceived as an artificial person, owing its existence through creation by a sovereign power.” As a matter of fact, the statutory language employed owes much to Chief Justice Marshall, who in the Dartmouth College decision defined a corporation precisely as “an artificial being, invisible, intangible, and existing only in contemplation of law.”  The well-known authority Fletcher could summarize the matter thus: “A corporation is not in fact and in reality a person, but the law treats it as though it were a person by process of fiction, or by regarding it as an artificial person distinct and separate from its individual stockholders. It owes its existence to law. It is an artificial person created by law for certain specific purposes, the extent of whose existence, powers and liberties is fixed by its charter.” Dean Pound’s terse summary, a juristic person, resulting from an association of human beings granted legal personality by the state, puts the matter neatly.There is thus a rejection of Gierke’s genossenchaft theory, the basic theme of which to quote from Friedmann, “is the reality of the group as a social and legal entity, independent of state recognition and concession.” A corporation as known to Philippine jurisprudence is a creature without any existence until it has received the imprimatur of the state according to law. It is logically inconceivable therefore that it will have rights and privileges of a higher priority than that of its creator. More than that, it cannot legitimately refuse to yield obedience to acts of its state organs, certainly not excluding the judiciary, whenever called upon to do so.  As a matter of fact, a corporation once it comes into being, following American law still of persuasive authority in our jurisdiction, comes more often within the ken of the judiciary than the other two coordinate branches. It institutes the appropriate court action to enforce its right. Correlatively, it is not immune from judicial control in those instances, where a duty under the law as ascertained in an appropriate legal proceeding is cast upon it.  To assert that it can choose which court order to follow and which to disregard is to confer upon it not autonomy which may be conceded but license which cannot be tolerated. It is to argue that it may, when so minded, overrule the state, the source of its very existence; it is to contend that what any of its governmental organs may lawfully require could be ignored at will. So extravagant a claim cannot possibly merit approval. (G.R. No. L-23145.

"I think that’s what OP is getting at. If there’s no path forward defined by the constitution and hypothetically if everyone “went along with it”, what’s the most effective, democratic, etc. way to resolve it. I’d argue legislation or an amendment would be the most democratic resolutions in this scenario. But in a crisis scenario, all those things are just ignored because there’s no enforcement or consequences for ignoring them.   Realistically, I agree with your whole point that if we reach a constitutional crisis, then a bill won’t be passed because we’ve already had congress fail its checking power (and it could just be ignored), and a constitutional amendment requires 3/4 of the states, which weirdly seems possibly more likely than congress utilizing its power, but still extremely unlikely (and could be ignored?).  So… yeah I agree. I have no clue how you move forward when congress refuses to remove from office, and the executive just ignores laws or rulings. There is no path forward because whatever you do, it can be ignored by the executive. Other than states “rising up” or congress utilizing its power, there’s nothing to do that isn’t by force. ",MetallicGray,2025-03-24T10:02:44,14

The JCS would have no say anyway because they’re strictly advisory, but to be blunt the bigger issue would be maintaining unit cohesion.

"The previous commenter gave a sound logical response. Yours is an unsound illogical view. YOU declare that one sentence in the constitution was bypassed, but others, including the courts, disagree. The previous commenter pointed out how we arrive at a crisis once all other legal avenues have been violated and the only remaining way to return to rule of law would be to break the law. But as of now, we are still operating within the law. You can predict we’re coming to a crisis just like you can predict that all black people will become slaves again or all gays will be executed or the atmosphere will catch fire one day due to global warming, I mean “climate change”.

"The MOU is required before the election for him to be an eligible candidate for the election. He missed the deadline.   The MOU has anti terrorism- Hatch act And security requirements that needed to be completed in order for the transition team to be synced up with the incumbent side and all the departments that had done 2 years of preparation to be ready for a new administration.   If Trump had planned to do a coup signing the document on time would have tipped off the FBI and other agencies and he might have been blocked by a scandal and the agencies would have been on higher alert for any weird stuff with election machines. Mob threats or anything Abnormal.   Not signing the document until November 27th placed the countries Intelligence agencies at a disadvantage during the holidays and making any chance of catching malfeasance less likely.   That plus increased social media and money spent on adds and media coverage would be a smokescreen to cover any actions to win the election outside the fair and free election expectations.

"My guess, and I don't know what the experts say about it, is that we already passed the point where every individual representative can have meaningful input on legislation. Now they're functioning as their side's posse. Anyone can be meaningful in committee or in caucus meetings, or do important work behind the scenes, but until you've done that there's no reason to make a floor speech.  More people could give us the opportunity to do things differently. Maybe some of the elected people could function as staffers. Maybe some of them could vote remotely and stay back home doing work with their constituents. I'm sure someone can come up with a good use for the people.",gravity_kills,2025-03-24T11:30:19,3

"I'm inclined to think you shouldn't pile on the representatives and then find something to do with them, you should find the number of representatives that is the best balance between responsiveness and impact. If you're relegating elected reps to staffers and community outreach, you're just adding another layer of representatives between the people and their actual reps. If we assume a priori that more representatives is better then why not just go for direct democracy? Because we know that a 1:1 representative to voter ratio just isn't workable. The workable ratio is definately lower than 700,000:1, but I think even 100,000:1 is still unworkable for an organization that's supposed to have relatively equal authority.",VodkaBeatsCube,2025-03-24T11:38:23,0

"Yes he did and that is what makes this MOU the MORE egregious.   Trump knows how to do Transitions because he he done two before. And the 2020 one he put the poor GSA administrator in the cross hairs to manipulate and interfere with Joe Biden’s Transition.   He even signed the Presidential Transition Enhancement act of 2019 which updated the 1963 Presidential Transition Act. Both Acts of Congress.   SEC. 2. The Congress declares it to be the purpose of this Act to promote the orderly transfer of the executive power in connec- tion with the expiration of the term of office of a President and the inauguration of a new President. The national interest requires that such transitions in the office of President be accomplished so as to assure continuity in the faithful execution of the laws and in the conduct of the affairs of the Federal Government, both domestic and foreign. Any disruption occasioned by the transfer of the execu- tive power could produce results detrimental to the safety and well- being of the United States and its people. Accordingly, it is the in- tent of the Congress that appropriate actions be authorized and taken to avoid or minimize any disruption. In addition to the spe- cific provisions contained in this Act directed toward that purpose, it is the intent of the Congress that all officers of the Government so conduct the affairs of the Government for which they exercise responsibility and authority as (1) to be mindful of problems occa- sioned by transitions in the office of President, (2) to take appro- priate lawful steps to avoid or minimize disruptions that might be occasioned by the transfer of the executive power, and (3) https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-1612/pdf/COMPS-1612.pdf  2004 Intelligence and Terrorism Prevention Act https://www.congress.gov/bill/108th-congress/senate-bill/2845",Organic-Coconut-7152,2025-03-24T10:59:50,0

I don't think I'm committed to any particular number or ratio, except that it has to be large enough that the smallest subdivision, whether that's a district or a state, still gets enough to represent the differences within it.

"The point of representative democracy is that you cannot reasonably expect the general populace to be fully informed on every single topic that is involved in running a government, and to (theoretically at least) incentivize people to make decisions that have bigger long term benefits than their up front costs. You can see from even California's very limited form of direct democracy that people tend to vote for things that have short term direct benefits or that appeal to them emotionally without regard to the long term ramifications of the policies they vote for.  Running a country is no less a job than running anything else. Actually being effective requires time and knowledge that most people just aren't going to have the time to cultivate outside needing to do their own jobs.",VodkaBeatsCube,2025-03-24T11:53:58,3
