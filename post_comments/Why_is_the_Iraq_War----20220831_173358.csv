"It just wasn't as *big.*  It seems weird to say that about the largest anti-war protest in human history (Feb 2003) but the anti-Iraq War movement just wasn't as comprehensive and polarizing as the protests against the Vietnam War.  It's important to remember that violence was a much more consistent part of the anti-war movement with regards to Vietnam. Draft offices were raided and the paperwork in them destroyed or the offices themselves were blown up or burned down and you had protest groups bombing targets related to the war effort. During the war itself you had instances of ""fragging,"" or soldiers deliberately killing other soldiers or more often, commanding officers. There were around a thousand documented instances of this happening with many more suspected.   Anti-war protests themselves were comparatively quite violent. Police weren't as well armed but firehoses, dogs, and batons were regular participants and protesters pretty regularly clashed with police in ways we didn't see again until you had the rise of more heavily militarized police in the US and incidents like the WTO protests in the 90's.  That simply does not have a correlate in the 2000's anti-war protest movement. It was, by and large, very civil and violence was abhorred by most of the larger participating organizing bodies. You didn't have people blowing up recruitment offices or killing their commanding officers out of anger and frustration.  It's also important to remember that the Iraq War enjoyed *a lot* more popular support at home than the Vietnam War eventually had. Even as the war dragged on, a lot of Americans still really weren't against the war, at least not in a way that might prompt them to blow up a building or throw a brick at a cop. People weren't being drafted and sent to Vietnam, they were voluntarily signing up to go to Iraq.  The casualties were vastly different as well. Something like 60,000 killed and 300,000 wounded in Vietnam vs 4,500 killed and 30,000 wounded in Iraq. That coupled with the overall tenor of the wars was wildly different.  We weren't *winning* in Iraq but we also weren't getting hundreds of kids being sent back in body bags every week with more being forced to go fight. We had casualties but it wasn't this never-ending drum beat of hundreds and hundreds, many of whom weren't going of their own free will. We weren't winning in Vietnam and it fueled frustration because it felt like we were feeding young men into the meat grinder for no reason.   That psychological weight added a lot of fuel to the anti-war movement that just wasn't there for Iraq.",HeloRising,2022-09-03T04:10:24,3
"Possibly because we are the generation “going through it.” So it is still pretty fresh. Folks are still actively going through the ramifications of the war whether they are the veteran, friends of, family members or lovers. And also the direct impact .. I remember a lot of people were pro-war for Iraq.",InevitableSwordfish6,2022-09-13T01:21:13,1
"One war included draftees, the other war had an all volunteer military.  One war was was live on TV and the internet, the other was in Newspapers and has short reports on the TV evening news.",cincyblog,2022-09-15T13:43:07,1
"The thing is, 1980s-1990s media \*heavily\* discussed the impact of the Vietnam peace movement in the 1960s-1970s.   There doesn't seem to be as much of an impression left by the Iraq-era peace movement on subsequent popular culture, almost like there is mass amnesia about it. And it's telling that those who were pro-war and pro-Bush gradually changed their tune enough to establish conditions where the country went for a Democratic candidate in 2008 (though that was due to a number of factors including the financial crisis, as well as the desire for racial equity in having the option of voting for the first POC president, etc.)",LockedOutOfElfland,2022-09-13T19:41:57,1
