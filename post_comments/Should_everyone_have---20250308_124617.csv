"When you restrict voter access based on knowledge, the people in power will get to select who gets to pick them.   Look at Jim crow literacy tests, designed so that you could pass or fail the person no matter how they answer the questions.",NecessaryIntrinsic,2025-03-08T21:41:30,59
"Even if Brennan is correct, there is no mechanism to identify those who are not qualified to participate in self rule that would not be hijacked and used to maintain the power of a specific subset of the populace over the rest of it. Bluntly, this is so obvious to me that I am not prepared to entertain the idea that Brennan hasn’t realized this, and so I do not trust his stated motivations for arguing in favor of a limited franchise. My assumption is that Brendan’s motives are impure.",RichardEpsilonHughes,2025-03-08T21:37:24,98
"Restricting who can vote or not based on someone's evaluation of their ideological beliefs is not democracy.  In a democracy, the voters are never wrong and it's much more about the process than any one particular result.",AVonGauss,2025-03-08T20:45:34,57
"> She bases her argument on ""cognitive diversity"", the idea that while individuals may be flawed or uninformed, a large and diverse group working together will often arrive at better solutions than a small group of experts. According to her, restricting the vote based on knowledge would not improve democracy but instead turn it into an exclusionary system that benefits only the privileged.  Voting in elections every couple of years is not a large and diverse group working together. This argument would be legit if we had sortition and the entire political system was run by juries from top to bottom. Then you'd actually see the benefits of cognitive diversity and including everyone in governance. What we have now is a joke, a meme. Representative democracy in the era of the Internet and social media is untenable. Post-truth populism isn't going anywhere. It's just going to be an escalating insanity spiral of people electing worse and worse leaders because vibes told them so and because they are totally removed from reality of governance. You would not see the likes of Trump voters and ""moderates"" celebrating federal workers being fired if they were all consistently forced since 18 years old to participate in governance through juries. They'd understand how insane it is to destroy the bureaucracy, US allies and relationships, and to reject engagement with the world. And being constantly exposed through juries to all kinds of Americans would also seriously challenge and undermine the oppressive, exclusionary ideologies.  In short, we just need an actual democracy. Representative democracy is over.  Either it dies or we all die with it in the flames of populist insanity.",persistentInquiry,2025-03-08T21:31:34,11

The right to vote and the right to have a say in government must be broad based, and government should be responsive to the people.    Arguably, our current state is due to failing political institutions: a Senate that entrenches certain states and classes with outsized importance, gerrymandered legislatures at the state and federal level that prevent the people's voices from being legitimately heard, social media platforms with boutique algorithms that push people into echo chambers and are controlled by tech elites, non-proportional elections, and on and on.

"Having ignorant people voting causes some problems, yet restricting who can vote is liable to bias and corruption.  How about this system?

Have enough representatives and small enough districts that most people know their representative personally, so they don't just vote based on party or public claims.

"I think neither is right overall, but that the so-called competent would be the ones who meritocratically get to the top and can make the decisions, so we have to make it so that we, both, select good people for this ranks based on a long learn and search process (school), and make it so that voting for government is not that essential for the well functioning of government (from a strong bureaucracy), such that the results of elections are a bit more symbolic than substantive.  I think that would lead me to side with Landemore as the de jure basis, but with the de facto goal being building, stabilizing, and strengthening the bureaucracy over time by pursuing making the Brennan approach be of crucial social importance.  China has sort of found this current balance by the more sinister approach of pure authoritarianism at the outset, so I’m just hoping we don’t have too many people trying to get back to a strong bureaucracy with an approach based in that direction, and can be smarter and more civil about how we try to get back on track.",barchueetadonai,2025-03-09T18:56:04,1
"Everyone should be allowed to vote.  If you're concerned about ignorant people, educate them so they are not ignorant.  If you're concerned about votes being easily manipulated by political advertising, ban it and ban money in politics.  Universal suffrage is not the issue.

"Both have glaring problems. For one: who would determine the criteria that someone is capable of voting, and what would that criteria look like? As others have mentioned, this idea is reminiscent of the racist literacy tests during the Jim crow era. Intelligent people will decide who can vote. Furthermore, look at the education system in the US...the level of education is highly variable state to state, and even more so once income becomes a factor. IMO: this would lead to a *very* imbalanced government vs majority.   On the other hand, people definitely do vote with their emotions, but even the intelligent group will still have people voting in an irrational manner. By allowing everyone to vote, more voices are heard. However, it'll liking lead to much more campaigning (real or fake) and marketing to sway the population.  What needs to happen, is for people to learn, understand, and actually apply critical thinking skills and show up at the polls. After all, any policy can be communicated as good or bad (even in academic settings with highly educated people). It all comes down to what the politician/policy is try to say, and then using the data/research to either confirm that theory or poke enough holes in it that it raises doubts. But at least if people had critical thinking (which should be taught at all levels and in all schools everywhere), then at least the voting population would have enough braincells to vote for what they actually think they are voting for, and can question the validity of a politician's claims, and hopefully consider the potential outcomes win or lose.",Distinct_Shower181,2025-03-10T03:07:10,1
"It is less that everyone should have the right to vote, and more that government should have no power to decide who votes.  The restriction and focus should be on the government.

"No.   The lesson of America’s failure is that universal democracy is a sure path to kakistocracy.   Subjective voting requirements can be misused, but a democracy without them, sooner or later, *will be* mismanaged. Literacy tests were an example of misuse—but they don’t mean that all future attempts at ensuring voters’ competence will be similarly bad faith. We need to figure this out.  Democracies do not have a built-in mechanism to ensure that the most competent or knowledgeable voters have greater influence.  If low-information voters outnumber high-information voters, then kakistocracy becomes a statistical inevitability.  Systems that expand voter participation without addressing decision quality are not virtuous—they are promoting mismanagement, corruption and dysfunction.",DontHateDefenestrate,2025-03-11T17:57:16,1
"The biggest problem with democracies is that some 30% don't vote. Were there to be a mechanism by which some 90% voted, democracy will hum along.

"I'm late to the argument but here goes ... At least in one country (the USA) there seems to be a problem with stupidity damaging governance, as evidenced by current events. Excluding the stupid/ignorant from participation in elections might remedy this. (The idea of ""cognitive diversity"" seems like a bad joke frankly.)  The main issue seems to be how literacy  tests were used against blacks in jim crow.  But the problem was not that blacks were illiterate and whites not, it was that the tests were enforced selectively against black would-be voters. But the corruption came from the voting being controlled by local white supremacists. corrupt enforcement is not inevitable.  In the US voting has always been handled by state and local authorities. Other countries take the practice more seriously. IMHO corrupted knowledge tests could be prevented in the USA by a well-regulated national system.",Regular-Platypus6181,2025-03-12T15:00:42,1

The end of Reconstruction and the disarming of the black militias led directly to the rise of the KKK and other terrorist organizations,  mass lynchings, disenfranchisement, and rigged elections, and very bad government for over a century.

"My response is sort of a non-answer. Do I believe, as Brennan does, that an informed electorate is better? Of course I do. Do I believe, as Landemore does, that representation of the whole, varied, diverse population is better? Of course I do.  But there is a reason that universal suffrage - that is to say, that every adult citizen should have the protected right to vote - is a good, moral, and just establishment. And it has nothing to do with the efficacy of the government it produces.  Universal suffrage is good because every citizen that is subject to how the society he or she belongs is managed deserves a say in how it is managed. It is the antithesis of divine monarchy, that legitimacy and authority is derived from God or a monarch, top-down - it is the notion that legitimacy and authority are granted by the governed, bottom-up.  That the governed are not uniform in their acumen to vote, nor their perspectives and experiences, is irrelevant to that fundamental belief that every individual citizen should get the right to exercise their small amount of power however they see fit.  Sorry if this was ranty, but I’m of the persuasion that universal suffrage and democracy itself don’t exist to tackle a question of societal efficiency or effectiveness, but a question of societal legitimacy and authority.

"I think in order to answer the question, you have to first look at the history of voting.  Originally, you had to be a land owner in order to have a vote.  This actually makes alot of sense...otherwise you could just send a large population from a foreign country to each of the colonies and vote in a foreign leader.  Then we amended this rule with the allowance that, if you served in the War, you'd be able to vote.  This also makes sense, if you're willing to lay down your life and fight for this country...you should have a say in how it's managed.  Now look at today, 2025. There are two types of voters (Three but the third is a technicality.  You have Men, who (at 18) must register for selective services and willfully agree to be drafted should it be needed again.  Historically, tens of millions of Men have already died after being drafted, so the fact that you have to sign up for the draft is no trivial matter.  Failure to register is a felony...and Felons can't vote...among other things.  And then there's Women, who by virtue of birth are afforded the right to vote when they turn 18....and that's the end of the list of requirements for them.  Do I think everyone should...I'm on the fence.  What I DO know is that there is a HUGE disparity regarding the price to vote between Men and Women.

"I never understand why the right wing ""we're a republic not a democracy"" weirdos always have to make up some insane theory that doesn't make any sense instead of just looking at what the words mean in literally any dictionary, or on Wikipedia, or anything.    It's actually really easy.   A republic is any government that doesn't have a monarch and the leadership is decicided by the public through some some method (often but not always an election). From the Latin (res publica: public's affair).    A democracy is any government where leadership and/or policy is decided by a public vote. Government where leaders are chosen by vote to represent a group of people is representative democracy. Government where policy/legislation is decided by voting is a direct democracy. [note: nations where the election is rigged or otherwise controlled don't count as democracies]    America is all of these things, our leaders are not monarchs (despite Trump's efforts to date), we vote for representatives at the various levels of government, and mostly at the state and local level, we vote for legislation directly.      It's pretty easy to understand. Even children are capable of the complex thinking to reckon with a thing being in more than one category.    I wonder why the political right is so insistent on defining America as a country that doesn't vote for their leaders?

There are illiterate adults in America, and they have the same rights and privileges as any other adult. It’s not about education at all.   We’ve collectively come to the conclusion as a society, through the law, as to what age is acceptable for all these things.

In Alabama and Nebraska, the age of majority is 19. In Mississippi, the age of majority is 21.”  Notice that there’s different ages depending on where you’re at. Notice also that there’s no mention of intelligence or education. That’s because your rights and the laws apply to you regardless of if you’re uneducated or not. It’s not about whether or not you’re dumb, it’s about if society collectively has decided, through the law, that we are fine with someone doing something or maintaining a certain level of responsibility like debt. It’s primarily about their level of life experience being too low as a young person to necessarily be fully responsible.  Again, it’s not about education. There are college graduates under 18. Just because they graduate doesn’t mean they can legally do all the things an adult can. They still haven’t reached the age society has decided they should be held fully responsible.

Government where **policy/legislation is decided by voting** is a direct democracy.  Except this isn't how leaders or policy and/or legislation is decided in the United States.  By your account, if this were truly how it works in the U.S. then if someone proposed a law that made it illegal to post negative comments about a sitting president online, if it received enough votes then people would start going to jail for badmouthing the president here on reddit.  By your account, if we truly were a democracy and we voted our leaders into office, we could vote a Foreigner who's never been a citizen of the U.S. into the Presidency.  If we ARE a Democracy of any sort and we truly do vote our Government Leaders into office...why can't we do that?  You see, the power of the vote ISN'T the determining factor here.  The U.S. constitution is the highest authority in the land and it specifically stops dumb shit from happening regardless of how many votes it receives.  THAT is the difference between a Democracy and a Constitutional Republic.  Under ANY type of Democracy, the power of the vote is absolute and can be used to vote citizens out of rights and power.  This is actually what's happening in the UK right now with people being arrested for sharing posts from others on facebook that contain misleading or otherwise incorrect information.  The UK has no constitution, instead the power of the vote is supreme...so now it's illegal to speak freely on facebook if their government says it is.

"Trump doesn't care what's legal.  He has no problem doing what isn't legal, and nobody cares to stop him.  He has also talked about revoking citizenship for people.  So basically any distinction we make for voting is something that could easily be undone/changed at the whim of a dictator.  If it's citizenship status, then he can just revoke it.   The Constitution sets the voting age at 18.  States can likely lower this because rights given by the Constitution are interpreted as a ""minimum right"", meaning that states can go above and beyond, but cannot restrict any further than the minimum outlined by the Constitution.  This could be tricky on the subject of age, though.  The idea should be that states are free to allow more people the right to vote than is allowed by the Constitution, but that they can't restrict people beyond what the Constitution states.  So that interpretation would mean that states could lower their voting ages.  As far as I know, I don't think any states have tried lowering the voting age though except maybe in some local elections (such as school board).

If 49 vote yes, and only 20 vote no, the bill would fail.  However, in the US it's a representative democratic republic, which is a form of democracy, albeit with an additional layer. Instead of citizens voting directly for taco Tuesday, they would now vote for representatives with the idea that these representatives will cast their vote in congress according to the desires of their constituents. In both of you ""By your account"" paragraphs, citizens could elect representatives that want to pass a bill and/or add an amendment to alter the constitution, thus allowing a foreigner to be elected US president, and free speech to go away. We literally could do that, but most people don't want to eliminate free speech or allow a foreign individual to be president. But that's because not enough people want to vote for it or pass a new amendment to allow for that. However, it is not impossible for that to happen, as you seem to be saying.

No im not.
