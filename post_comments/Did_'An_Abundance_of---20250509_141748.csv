"Hindsight is 20/20. We were dealing with a *novel deadly virus*. Of course remote learning sucked, but the alternative could've been way worse.",Buntin_Carswell,2025-05-09T14:19:12,34
"No, the wishy washy open close open close debate did though.   We likely could have shut everything down for 4-6 weeks, listened to experts and scientists, and let covid fizzle itself out as we learned more about it and came up with a solid plan to mitigate it upon reopening.   Instead people refused masks, coughed on food as a ""joke"", had fucking ""covid parties"" to try and promote herd immunity, and it's peak dragged on for nearly 2 years as people faught over it for no reason.   Of course remote learning sucked, but we put the worst possible plan in place for a full year before anyone took it seriously who had the power to try and help.",Spam_Hand,2025-05-09T14:23:09,31

> Millions of healthy children didn't set foot in a classroom for more than a year during the COVID pandemic.  I like how this article's first sentence undermines its entire thesis. Schools are hotbeds of disease even without novel pandemics. Sure most of the children wouldn't have died but that's still millions more potential infections to deal with.,733t_sec,2025-05-09T14:29:38,13
These debates almost universally forget that thousands of teachers' lives may have been saved by not forcing them into classrooms with sick kids who can't remember to cover their mouths when they cough or sneeze.,OkayComputer1701,2025-05-09T14:42:02,11
"It's difficult to compare a known quantity over a hypothetical situation. Maybe a ""let her rip"" solution would have caused significantly more adult deaths. That would have also had a negative effect on students. Maybe, with increased transmission, the virus would have mutated in a way different from how it did, for the worse, and caused even larger problems. Maybe infection on a mass scale, of a virus with neurological effects, would have caused even bigger problems for a population with developing brains.   No one ever thought what we did was the best solution. We erred on the side of caution. Which was absolutely the right choice. And it will always be the right choice for such problems.",E1M1_DOOM,2025-05-09T14:28:36,8

"Nope, down voting the article and not going to read it.   A) Absolutely not. I'm not at all sure I believe in a lot of the data on socialization issues etc, but I'm completely sure that dead children have worse problems socializing with their peers.",shoobe01,2025-05-09T14:22:47,21
Not available for comment are the OVER A MILLION AMERICANS WHO FUCKING DIED!  I have no patience left for people who want to act like the lockdown (which wasn't even in full) was the problem.,kyserzose,2025-05-09T14:24:55,2
I agree that closing down schools was the good idea but now that we did close down the schools another good idea would be to dump funding in the public education to help those kids catch back up.,animalslover4569,2025-05-09T14:42:52,3
The helicopter parent generation is going to use covid as the reason why their kids turned out dumb or socially awkward for years to come.,JesusWasBiAndTrans,2025-05-09T14:55:16,2
"I warned all the way back in spring 2020 that any pandemic response in the United States was doomed to fail, and that the measures being taken would just create a permanent 30% who would for the rest of their life advocate for the demolition of the establishment.  Sadly I was 100% correct in my prediction.  There is a fundamental difference between Europe and the United States, which is why to each other, these two areas of the world are the true threats to color revolutions against each other.  The European project is to re-establish the medieval Catholic church bureaucracy with every single modern critique addressed -- no Pope, no religion, full rights and representation for women, no dictated one language such as Latin, etc.  It has taken centuries or even much of a millenium to get there, but that is the European destination.  And the United States has a large part who did not want to belong to that European project.  There are therefore unique failure modes in the United States that would be unthinkable in Europe or in more developed parts of east Asia.  For example, elsewhere in the developed world, when humans retreat from rural areas, those rural areas, while at least having more poverty, do not suffer from exponentially increased violence and anarchy.  Whereas in the United States, the reaction to an abandoned area is to go in and start manufacturing some sort of illegal drug, with the resulting violence and addiction.  United States bureaucracies are bad in a way that European ones cannot be, bad in such a way that even the center left is not all that opposed to having entire bureaucracies blown up, even if they were supposedly helping millions of people.  Center left publications such as Slate and The Atlantic before the last election were publishing articles suggesting the United States educational system was leaving untold numbers of kids, even ones going to top universities, functionally illiterate, unable to read and understand more than short passages.  The center left media was basically carrying MAGA's water at least for the abolition of the Department of Education.  And President Trump's budget proposal calls for basically the blowing up of HUD, and that has drawn zero reaction in mainstream press.  It is almost as if the Democrats would be glad to fire a certain segment of their supposed base.",jphamlore,2025-05-09T15:41:52,0
"Maybe. Won’t know for sure for a while. What I know is that Covid lock downs definitely made my 2 nieces less adventurous/outgoing, at least that what it seems.",togocann49,2025-05-09T14:23:27,-2
Agreed.  We did the best we could at the time.  In hindsight of course we could have done things better.,Smithy2232,2025-05-09T14:23:53,10

"> … at the end of April and beginning of May, countries throughout Europe began reopening their schools. And 22 of them began reopening. We're talking about millions of children here. This is not a small one room schoolhouse in the mountains of Tibet. We're talking about millions of kids. The EU education ministers met virtually in May.  > And they said, after these schools that have been reopening, millions of kids, we've observed no negative consequence of reopening these schools. ",nosotros_road_sodium,2025-05-09T14:37:32,-10

Given intubations were at an all time high and hospitals were turning people away. Yes preventing potentially millions of more vectors for the disease to spread was worth it.,733t_sec,2025-05-09T14:33:07,11

Ooh if we're doing what abouts then what about all the parents of those children who were considerably more vulnerable to a novel disease and didn't die because their child didn't bring home the disease.
