Do they... do they really not understand what's going on here?  What Putin essentially recruited them for?  Did they think he actually wanted a fair and equitable peace?    These fuckin' rubes,ArticulateRhinoceros,2025-05-07T11:49:39,43

"Even if we somehow posit they're not working with or for Russia, that makes them look even worse as mediators.   - brag about being the only ones who can end the war - go mafia on Ukraine and give Russia everything they want because they firmly believe Russia is winning - wonders why Russia has no intentions of signing a fair deal for peace  Really? I wonder who could have seen that coming.",MammothDon,2025-05-07T14:22:45,3
"I think Trump, after messing EVERYTHING UP IN 100 DAYS is looking for an easy win, and since Trump has no allies, only temporary people he can use, Trump is now throwing Putin under the bus.  This right here is the signal that Trump might go against Putin.      The question is how long this will last!  Trump is easy to convince and will repeat whatever the last person spoke to him said.  If he can be kept away from Putin and pro-russia forces, then he'll continue to lose support for Russia, if he answers a call from Putin or a pro-Russian advisor talks to him, expect another flip in his Russia policy.  That's the frustrating part about this administration, you never know when Trump's opinion will change, what's just talk and what will actually be taken action on.",kia75,2025-05-07T12:51:49,2
