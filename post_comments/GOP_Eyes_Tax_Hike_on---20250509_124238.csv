"Good. Tax EVERYONE's endownments including churches.  Tax all ""charitable"" donations as well.  Why is uncle sam subsidizing a new building 40% when some billionaire ""donates"" $10M.  People LOVE to claim Americans are so charitable, would love to see how charitable they are when it doesn't result in tax deductions or ways to transfer wealth to your family and friends",giabollc,2025-05-09T12:56:50,3

"*From Bloomberg News reporter Nancy Cook and Erik Wasson:*  House Republicans are considering increasing taxes on university endowments, a significant threat to some of the nation’s wealthiest schools as President Donald Trump seeks to tighten control over American higher education.  The measure is in a draft of the tax package Republicans are weighing, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to share details on the effort. The proposal would create a tiered system of taxation so that wealthy colleges and universities pay more as the size of their endowment grows, the people said.  Republicans are considering boosting the 1.4% endowment tax currently on the books to rates as high as 14% to 21%, a person familiar with the matter said.  Targeting university endowments would be a major escalation of Trump’s fight with elite colleges and universities, which has seen the administration demand changes to school policies that reflect his priorities.

"The problem with even a “TINY” tax increase for the RICH, which I and all others would graciously accept in order to help the lower and middle income workers, is that the Radical Left Democrat Lunatics would go around screaming,“Read my lips,” the fabled Quote by George Bush the Elder that is said to have cost him the Election. NO, Ross Perot cost him the Election! In any event, Republicans should probably not do it, but I’m OK if they do!!!
