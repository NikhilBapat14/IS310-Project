"Trump becoming president again really shows a lot about the current state of the general American population. From Trump getting a plurality of votes to people just straight up not voting, it shows just how much Americans do not care about politics and that the ones that do care enough to vote wanted this. I do not for one second blame any country for reevaluating their relationship with the US. There is no guarantee that if, and that is one big if, America manages to get rid of Trump that down the road some other politician does the same thing or something more extreme. I mean, as an example, the Liberation Day tariffs caused an insane drop in the markets around the world. It was so bad that China, Japan and Korea, countries that historically have gone to such extreme measures to not deal with each other directly, agreed to jointly respond to the tariffs.",crimsonfang1729,2025-04-27T16:50:26,5

"I'd argue that the more important thing it revealed wasn't that a lot of americans are willing to vote for fascism, but rather that the institutions are incapable of dealing with it.   And that right there is the big picture, as far as geopolitical issues go, because it means that the US is incapable of adhering to its own dang constitution and legal precedent, so theres absolutely no guarantee that they'll adhere to any trade or security agreement. Which, that immediately came to pass, as the US started the largest (and stupidest) trade war in a century, to say nothing of threatening the sovereignty of its closest (geographically, politically, and culturally) ally.  Yes, the number of people who voted for trump is a huge issue. But the fact that he was even able to run for and then assume office? That's the more revealing thing",AugmentedDragon,2025-04-27T20:52:00,3
"It’s not too far fetched a conclusion, he’s already floating the use of the Medvedev Manoeuvre to serve as prez beyond term limits, is enriching the oligarchy around him to make sure they’re gonna be compliant with his policies.
