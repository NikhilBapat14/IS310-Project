"In a piece for *Health Affairs*, Hoover Senior Fellow [Scott W. Atlas](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/scott-w-atlas) and coauthors, including National Institutes of Health director and emeritus senior fellow [Jay Bhattacharya](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/jay-bhattacharya), survey lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic regarding physician autonomy, public health messaging, and the importance of free speech. The authors argue that in the course of the pandemic, “Suppression of scientific debate and the marginalization of dissenting voices weakened public trust in medical institutions.” They note the importance of physician-scientists being able to express dissenting and alternative views on pressing medical questions, maintaining that “suppressing alternative perspectives can lead to flawed policies that are difficult to reverse.” They conclude with a call for social media companies to prioritize free speech and to avoid “the temptation to censor,” building on the foundational free society principle that “the public should be trusted to assess information.”",HooverInstitution,2025-05-05T14:57:57,3
