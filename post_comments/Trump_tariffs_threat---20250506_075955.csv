"Trump Tariffs are designed to enrich the global banking cabal that supports Trump, not his MAGA base. Small and mid sized businesses will be be unable to operate anymore. The global banking cabal will buy these businesses at distressed prices.   The global banking cabal and military industrial complex sometimes want the same thing. Biden was more supported by the military industrial complex. Hence $350 Billion in US aid to Ukraine. Trump is more supported by the global banking cabal. These are shareholders in the US FED, BlackRock, and Mellon Bank et al.  The West used to be the place for the greatest financial ROI. But when the West couldn't beat Russia in the Ukraine proxy war, the global banking cartel started to rethink where they were putting their money. When the West couldn't ethnically cleanse Palestine after through Israel, the global banking cartels future profits were further put on alert.   Trump tariffs are designed to Make America Weak Again and Make Bankers Strong Again. Tariff uncertainty is driving money out of the US financial system. Who profits from by buying distressed price western assets and small businesses who couldn't pay for the tariffs? That's right, the global banking cartel.  Trump is shorting the US financial system. Look where he is putting his money....GCC, not the US.   The global banking cartel has decided higher ROI is to be made in the emerging regions of the GCC, China, BRICS, and the global south. Thus, Trump Tariffs help achieve that.",No-Confection-4272,2025-05-06T09:13:28,4
