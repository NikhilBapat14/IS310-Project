I don’t understand why the Trump admin based everything on him being in a gang. If they wanted to deport him they didn’t need to do that and now they’re dying on that hill. They could have deported him for several other reasons if they had put even a fraction of this effort into it.,Listening_Heads,2025-05-04T06:03:46,47

"# Abrego Garcia was called a 'gang member' in custody dispute. His accuser is now in prison  The Maryland wife of [the wrongfully deported Salvadoran immigrant](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/17/van-hollen-meets-abrego-garcia-el-salvador/83149691007/) briefly faced a custody challenge over the children she shared with another man.  Court documents show Edwin Ramos filed a custody petition in 2018 against[ Jennifer Vasquez Sura.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/05/01/kilmar-abrego-garcia-wife-domestic-abuse-audio/83395817007/) The pair had children born in 2014 and 2015 that were then raised by Vasquez Sura and Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who is at the center of the immigration debate that has reached the [Supreme Court](https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/supreme-court/).  In the court motion, Ramos wrote: “I’m afraid of my kids live (sic) are in danger because she is dating a gang member.”  Abrego Garcia was detained in 2019 by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and alleged to be a member of the MS-13 gang. [He has vehemently denied the affiliation.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/16/van-hollen-demands-abrego-garcia-release/83119729007/)",Hazer_123,2025-05-04T03:22:54,16

"Imma take it farther and say deporting people to a third party prison even with due process is wrong. It’s not extradition, these people are not being requested for trial or even as fugitives in the vast majority of deportations.",enonmouse,2025-05-04T07:48:33,119
"It’s not even just that, which is accurate.   The real story here is that if this guy’s name was Cletus Johnson, he had a shaved head instead of a Bulls hat, and he had swastika tattoos on his hands - he would be out on bail, awaiting a trial date.   This is 100% because Trump, his entire administration, and his MAGA hillbilly cult are all fucking racists who have been empowered by a pathetic Republican-controlled congress to act on their racism in whatever way they see fit.",DoomdUser,2025-05-04T09:16:38,34
It doesn't even matter if they proved he is. He hasn't been convicted of or even charged with a crime but he's being imprisoned for an indefinite period of time in a different country.,ActualTexan,2025-05-04T08:33:49,41
"Also, if he IS a gang member and they DO prove it being sent to a concentration camp is not the appropriate response. It's like how when a black guy gets shot by the cops for ""resisting arrest"" & they find something in his past to suggest he wasn't a perfect human being like a shoplifting charge or traffic violations. Even if it's true, executing them in the street without a trial is not the appropriate response there either.  Also, the whole ""we found a criminal complaint in this young black man's past"" is kind of like when a Palestinian is killed & the news reports that they had run-ins with the Israeli police. The Israeli police force intentionally overpolices Palestinian communities which leads to more arrests, both wrongful & for minor shit that they would never bother going after a Jewish Israeli citizen for. Similar to our cops here & their relationship to Black & Latin communities. It leads to people in those communities getting absolutely destroyed by the system for shit that white kids get away with because there aren't as many cops around and/or it would be wrong to ruin their life over something that should be handled without the force of violence & ruin that cops & the judicial system, as they are currently constituted, bring down on people.",acarlrpi12,2025-05-04T10:04:20,13

"You are confused about the goal.    They don't care what happens to him either way. They care about the headlines and the attention and the messaging.    They want to say they are locking gang members up in a forever prison because that is effective propaganda to lots of people.    Kilmar Abrego Garcia just got caught up in a propaganda effort, and he's almost certainly not the only one. The reason he is front and center is that one DOJ attorney had the courage to say in court that he was removed in error. ",spleeble,2025-05-04T15:23:28,2
It’s their attempt to contradict the Democrats innocently naming him “a Maryland father”,explosivepimples,2025-05-04T23:54:28,2
What they care about is being able to say and demonstrate that they are tough on immigration.  They couldn't care less who is being deported and why as long as they are demonstrating that they are tough and the liberals were|are weak.  That's all easier to do if you immediately get them out of the country and no longer under our control or oversight.   That process is what's being developed so it can be used to disappear any undesirables then they can move onto less-desirables and eventually troublemakers generally.,PunfullyObvious,2025-05-04T07:50:23,3
The gang angle was so we’d debate that rather than how unbelievably unconstitutional Trump’s admin has become.  It has sucked up all of the media’s attention and removed the oxygen needed to really point out to the public that incarceration without due process is a direct violation and in itself is highly illegal on an amendment level,NeverLookBothWays,2025-05-04T11:32:14,1

"This is from page 13-14 of the Supreme Court’s ruling  “Finally, I turn to the Government’s assertion that the public interest favors a stay because Abrego Garicia is a “prominent” member of MS-13 and is therefore “no longer eligible for withholding relief.” Mot. for Stay at 14–15. Whatever the merits of the 2019 13 determination of the Immigration Judge (“IJ”) regarding Abrego Garcia’s connection to MS-13,8 the Government presented “[n]o evidence” to the district court to “connect[] Abrego Garcia to MS-13 or any other criminal organization.” Dis.t Ct. Op. at 22 n.19; see also id. at 2 n.2 (“Invoking such theories for the first time on appeal cannot cure the failure to present them before this Court.”). Indeed, such a fact cannot be gleaned from this record, which shows that Abrego Garcia has no criminal history, in this country or anywhere else, and that Abrego Garcia is a gainfully employed family man who lives a law abiding and productive life. Tellingly, the Government “abandon[ed]” its position that Abrego Garcia was “a danger to the community” at the hearing before the district court. Dist. Ct. Op. at 22 n.19. The balance of equities must tip in the movant’s favor based on the record before the issuing court. An unsupported -- and then abandoned -- assertion that Abrego Garcia was a member of a gang, does not tip the scales in favor of removal in violation of this Administration’s own9 withholding order. If the Government wanted to prove to the district court that Abrego Garcia was a “prominent” member of MS-13, it has had ample opportunity to do so but has not -- nor has it even bothered to try.”  In case you missed it- IF THE GOVERNMENT WANTED TO PROVE TO THE DISTRICT COURT THAT ABREGO GARCIA WAS A “PROMINENT” MEMBER OF MS-13, IT HAS HAD AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO BUT HAS NOT- NOR HAS IT EVEN BOTHERED TO TRY.”",kmm198700,2025-05-04T04:44:28,40
