"*From Bloomberg contributor Simon Nixon*      The US has for decades been the beneficiary of a giant global “brain gain” that began with the arrival of refugees from Germany’s world-beating research-led universities in the 1930s. A potential exodus of foreign researchers from the US, combined with the cuts to science funding, is likely to have long-term economic consequences.      The danger arising from the Trump administration’s war against its perceived US-university enemies is not just that it drives some American academics to look for jobs elsewhere, but that it encourages the next generation of the world’s brightest students to further their education in China. History suggests that revolutions, once started, are hard to stop.

"The truth is that this is a stupid acceleration of a problem that started years ago. Lots of foreign students were coming here for their doctorates and post-docs (which is a good thing for the US and scientific community), then leaving because the Chinese government would provide them with funding they just couldn’t get here. Now we won’t even be able to attract talented students for their training, let alone keep them here. Fortunately information can travel much more rapidly than it did in the 30’s and 40’s, but rebuilding infrastructure and updating core facilities that rely on huge grants will be what lags behind.",meTspysball,2025-05-09T10:36:20,4
