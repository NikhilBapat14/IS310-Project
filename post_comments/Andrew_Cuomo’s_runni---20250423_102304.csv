"He's basically running on name recognition. It's crazy to me that he's up in the pollls, considering the amount of women that credibly accused him of sexual misconduct.",ColeBeasleyMD,2025-04-23T10:27:26,13
"He's actually running on the notion that it's his God given right to be mayor of a city he doesn't reside in, after resigning from the governor's office in disgrace due to sexual misconduct.  That's not competence, that's just him being a massive piece of shit.",Someguy2189,2025-04-23T10:30:38,8
"I do not understand how he is even in the running, I feel like I have taken crazy pills.",Stinkycheese8001,2025-04-23T10:49:04,3
God the party is just so..... stupid,Bross93,2025-04-23T10:52:23,3
I wish he'd just retire and go away. Then it'd finally be one of the few competent things he's ever done.,Traditional-Level-96,2025-04-23T10:29:30,6

Maybe it's because most of our leaders are idiots who got there because they are great at networking and smiling nice.,katyadc,2025-04-23T12:30:06,1
"Voters really don't care about sexual misconduct, as they showed last year. It's purely about name recognition as you said or some appeal to grievances.",Scarlettail,2025-04-23T10:36:12,4
"There's also a strong sense of ""things were good under Cuomo"" obviously not in reference to his time during Covid but pre Covid he was standing up to trump and the American economy was enjoying the Obama recovery.  Hopefully people are reminded of his scandals and back off supporting him because he would not only be bad for NYC and run a toxic administration but he would drag the whole party nationally.",jimmydean885,2025-04-23T11:56:29,3
