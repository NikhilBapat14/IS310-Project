Doubt. Another article to lull the masses. Most people don’t even know what’s been happening and won’t realize something is up until things get bad. We are f’d as a nation.,AcidRohnin,2025-04-29T15:32:58,7

"He cost Republicans the House and Senate in 2018. He lost the election in 2020. He was convicted of 35 felonies and found liable for rape. He's barred from ever running a charity in the state of New York. God knows how much money he's had to spend in fines and court fees.  He's not ""completely untouchable"". It's just that you think, unless he's being carted away in chains like Hannibal Lecter, you feel he's not actually faced any sort of repercussions.  Also, yeah, it's indisputable that ""cracks are starting to show"". His poll numbers are so bad that they triggered a 3 AM meltdown. His administration is in chaos. He's walked back several policies...",Subliminal_Kiddo,2025-04-29T15:58:49,5

"Not a single one of the things you listed as a loss for him has slowed him down or obstructed his progress in getting back to the Oval. Sure, it probably annoyed him to be convicted, but his previous political losses are now gains. And he’s made more money than he’s lost, not to mention that his legal fees were not paid out of his own pocket. He’s richer than he was last time he was in office and making money hand over fist now.  The least charitable man on planet Earth doesn’t give a shit if he can’t run a charity because that was only ever about money and he’s making tons of that now. The only ‘cracks’ that matter are the ones that translate to him leaving office, and those are virtually non-existent. Murkowski saying she can’t vote the way she wants to because she’s afraid for her safety and McConnell waxing about not impeaching him before are not actionable. His recent EO is a vague nod to declaring martial law in 90 days, the market is in a free fall, egregious national security risks have been exposed and our vulnerabilities as a nation are ocean-sized, and despite low approval ratings, not a single Republican has signaled for change despite the president being a lame duck. They SHOULD be freaking out and desperately worried about losing their jobs. But they are not saying a single tiny peep. Why? Because they’re not worried about the midterms. That alone should terrify everyone, but it doesn’t. Everything he lost and every ‘consequence’ has only made him more stable with his base. He doesn’t need to be hauled away in chains, but it’s also painfully clear that he is (by his own admission) having a whole lot of fun now. Until and unless he leaves office, he is absolutely not experiencing any significant consequences for his history of criminal abuses. If the cracks are just party disarray and him melting down on social media, that’s just a regular Tuesday- not even a slight crack.",ElderberryNo3663,2025-04-29T21:40:22,3
"Yes, of course those things are all true, but I guess I see it like this. Yes, he lost, but he’s back, crazier and than ever and actively destroying the country. Yeah he was found guilty of crimes, nothing happened, there’s no punishment and he still got elected. So that’s a nothingburger to me same as not being able to run a charity in New York. Okay he can’t run a charity but he’s literally running the country so that feels like a drop in the bucket. He had tons of meltdowns during election season and would call into newsmax raging at them but it all didn’t matter because he still won the electoral and popular votes and is now president fucking everything up. Whatever repercussions he’s faced are so out of step with the wrongs he’s committed they feel like nothing to me personally. He’s the damn president bad poll numbers or not. But I do admire your attitude tbh",Decent-Friend7996,2025-04-29T16:06:08,2

"Right now I would say it's economic reality catching up with him. They can lie and pretend the tariffs and chaos coming out of the White House are good, but the effects are being felt across the country and world. The drop off of imports from China is going to be a big shit hits the fan moment I feel, and it's coming soon.

His handlers plan to use the fallout from the economic turmoil to  enact martial law. That's why he wants to give the police free legal representation and is already trying to deploy the military domestically. Everything is going to plan for team Fascism.,micmedia,2025-04-29T18:01:03,3

"The issue with this is maybe they want calm just long enough to have the markets destabilize, while they set up their pawns and proceed to the next step.  He can simply lie for a few months and majority of his braindead supporters would eagerly clean that diaper every time.  He only has to keep lying and hoping those braindead enough don’t wake up before he has all the pieces in place.  I don’t think he is a smart man but that doesn’t mean others behind him pulling the strings are as incompetent as he is. They also may be more brazen since they aren’t the forward facing person if/when shit does hit the fan. All gas, no brakes.",AcidRohnin,2025-04-30T09:58:31,1
