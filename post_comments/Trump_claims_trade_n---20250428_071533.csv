"""Online negotiations are happening everyday with China"" could mean a daily call to a person named China at a 1-900 number.   Just sayin...",Popular-Drummer-7989,2025-04-28T07:36:35,4
"Xi is so clearly following strategy it makes me believe China has been preparing for this eventuality since trump Number One, maybe even made some early moves knowing how trump Number Two would respond. trump Number Two is being way overplayed by Xi, who wants world trade and of course by Putin, who wants territory, while Number Two only wants ego",AlaskaRecluse,2025-04-28T07:40:50,2

"He thinks any day China is going to blink and beg to go back to normal and he can claim a victory. So for now what he thinks he’s gotta do is keep the markets calm. How has he done that in the past?  Lie and tell the market what it wants to hear. Problem is that groceries aren’t stocks. I don’t need to wait three months to know I am in fact…hungry. Household budgets aren’t futures or bonds that might dip or spike here and there, they’re often strict with little leeway. Once it hits, it hits bone and nerve. Fast and painfully.  People are already reporting empty overstock, soon that will be empty shelves, and that will become panic buying as people begin to worry about what ELSE may stop showing up on shelves. We are going back to 2020 folks; supply chain is getting disrupted AGAIN.   Trump will keep saying negotiations are happening, until negotiations are actually happening and then they make grand foofurrah about negotiations beginning and pretend they never said anything prior. Negotiations won’t start until Trump is wriggling on the hook like a fat orange worm, China has no reason to back down, the world remains open to their goods and the world is happy to buy! So let the US stew for a year or two, let Trump sweat as the public gets angrier and angrier, see what happens. Then when Trump is desperate and ready to do anything to get the shipments moving again, thats when you deign to let him come to Beijing and grovel for a trade deal that will favor China over all and cripple the USA. Trump will return, claim victory, and move on to the next crisis and his army of orcs will hail the genius of the beast (for who is as wise as the beast?)  This is going to be devastating folks.",PloddingAboot,2025-04-28T07:52:18,1
"fArt of the deal,  Used to work, when there was a decorum and decency. Both parties are negotiating in good faith in public eyes, and throw feces at each other in private. Trump switched it around, and though China is not as mighty as US, by throwing feces all around, he has isolated and alienated allies, frenemies, and adversaries equally.  Now China, doesn't have to follow the decorum and decency, so they are not taking sh!t. Too bad, we used to have all the upperhand. Now just a mouth breather",foodie_geek,2025-04-28T08:25:17,1

China is negotiating.  With Japan and Australia. China is finding markets.  Trump? Is negotiating his soul with the devil and Putin.,juni4ling,2025-04-28T20:36:50,1
"You know, I actually wonder. Over the weekend he said his people told him he won 9-0 at SCOTUS.   Don’t get me wrong, Trump, lies, and grifts are synonymous. But here I wonder if he is just completely checked out, the Millers and Navarros of the world are telling him what he wants to hear, and all the while, a bunch of unelected fascist demagogues are running the government by being the very thing the GOP has complained about for two decades — the administrative deep state.",MattTheSmithers,2025-04-28T11:32:10,4
