"There isn't a single person involved here that isn't a malignant narcissist.   There is no script, or maybe there are hundreds, but the important thing to remember is that not a single person involved here can follow direction. Their egos will not let them.  The Trump/Musk love affair was always doomed. We were just hoping that it would blow up faster so that the damage done can be limited.",m0ngoos3,2025-04-27T19:41:41,7
