"How can what this monster is offering be even a remotely legal thing for a sitting president to do? Who's going to pay for what it takes to host such a dinner? Taxpayers most likely. Trump trying to make money while most of his constituents are losing it, is pure evil grifting. Greedy, thy name is Donald Trump.",invalidpassword,2025-04-24T00:36:16,16

"Many people get scammed due to their own greed. In this case, if it works out, good for you. If it doesn't,  you will know why and must not cry about it. People should know Trump's business history by now. Same principle as flushing money down the toilet.",Stropi-wan,2025-04-24T02:37:17,2
