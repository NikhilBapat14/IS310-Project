"“The future path of the dollar depends on how the current uncertainty about government trade and other macroeconomic policies plays out, Adrian said at a press briefing. In an earlier interview with MarketWatch, Adrian said concerns that the U.S. might lose its top spot in global markets were overstated.”",Lantis28,2025-04-22T13:11:46,4
Let's be clear about what Market Watch's narrative has always been: For the oligarchs.,williamgman,2025-04-22T13:32:13,1
"Makes sense.  Trump will likely back down before it gets too bad, or Congress will act to take away his power to impose tariffs.  And even if not, where else will investors go?  China's dealing with a property bubble collapse and deflation.  Europe's been at 0% GDP growth and will probably get pulled into negative territory if the US enters recession.",liulide,2025-04-22T13:24:26,2

While I admire your optimism... He's been pretty close to this as his example: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy\_of\_Nazi\_Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Nazi_Germany),williamgman,2025-04-22T13:33:53,3
"Also, I've heard, and I may stumble on this, that China is more ""reserved"" when it comes to their yuan than the US is with its dollar. So investors (?) Etc, have more freedom with the dollar, and so prefer it?   I know butchered what I was trying to articulate, but does that make sense?",Ello_Owu,2025-04-22T16:16:59,1
"I would hope not.  Nazi Germany was by far the most dynamic economy on the planet in the 1930s.  In 10 years, it was able to go from a hyperinflating country in shambles to having enough resources to conquer Europe.  If Trump can pull that off, he'll handily win a third term.",liulide,2025-04-22T13:42:57,1
It's not Trump I worry about. Vance was put in by the shadow govt for a reason. They don't expect Trump to make it full term. They won't need him. Given his age and ill health... It won't be him finishing the term.  Trump (and his father) have always been fascinated with 1930's German history. That's the only reason he's doing what he's doing. Many narcissists can relate to that period of history.   As far as the comparisons... Hitler used a war economy to grow it. Germany invested heavily in manufacturing at home. The oligarchs here have no plans of doing that given the cost of investment (usually foreign) and the shareholder driven economy we have. Just imagine a bunch of self absorbed market makers working for oligarchs being told they will have to wait many months if not years for investment returns. And it will be THEIR money (like Germany did) being used for it. No way... It's DOA.,williamgman,2025-04-22T13:59:37,6
