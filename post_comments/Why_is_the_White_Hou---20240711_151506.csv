"Because Modi announced at the beginning of the conflict that India can't afford to do anything that's not the very best deal it can get for its people. Their hands are kind of tied about it, so the US has decided to keep working with the neutral poor country that's stuck between a rock and a hard place vs making an enemy/opponent of the most populous country in the world.   Also because they buy our military equipment, iirc. China does not.",theRuathan,2024-07-11T22:10:01,10
Coz Modi took Biden's handphone during one of the Summits and got all his dirt and little secrets.,Sure_heartsutra1221,2024-07-12T11:10:45,1
"Because China is the big bad enemy right now.  It is unconstructive to frame India as having deeply troubling human rights issues such as treatment of minorities and the region of Kashmir and geopolitical actions that are counter to US interest such as cozy relations with Russia when the whole gist bang of US strategy against China is to paint it as a totalitarian state hellbent on oppression and ""genocide"" of minorities and controlling places that are recognized as part of China internatinoally such as HK and Tibet.",Financial-Chicken843,2024-07-16T04:35:04,1
What you see on media is a facade . America and west are  actively trying to destabilise regions around india and india itself using proxy warfare .  They won't show it directly .,xdotwhat,2024-08-07T19:49:55,1

"Appreciate the response.  And I get that India is doing what’s best for them and that they are not rich per capita.  But India is ranked #5 in the world based on GDP.  So with that said, when we are talking about empowering/enabling….  I’d think being such a big friendly trading partner with Russia definitely means something when you’re ranked #5 in the world.  For instance I found the article below:  >India’s bilateral trade with Russia stood at $65.6 billion in FY24, up 33 per cent year-on-year, and nearly 5.5 times higher than the pre-pandemic trade of $10.1 billion. The bilateral trade has increased especially since 2022 with Indian fuel importers snapping up discounted Russian crude despite repeated criticism by Western nations.  https://www.business-standard.com/amp/economy/news/india-russia-aim-for-100-billion-bilateral-trade-target-by-2030-124070901077_1.html  I just don’t get it…. I mean I’m pretty sure with our imbalanced trade deficit- they need us to buy their cheap goods just as much if not more than we need to buy from specifically them (ie there are plenty other countries that offer cheap goods).  I’m a little disappointed why people don’t talk about this more.  From Modi’s treatment of Muslims in Kashmir to believing he is some god… I just find it super frustrating that the White House continues allowing him to play both sides.  I have a couple of theories why - but I certainly would love to hear others opinions.",[deleted],2024-07-11T23:36:19,1
"The simple answer is India has the potential of becoming a economic and military peer to China, while remaining out of their orbit. Imagine a world where China used its influence to promote stability, that is the prize that is up for grabs.",ResidentBackground35,2024-07-11T23:52:18,3

I totally agree with you about India’s potential.  But Im not quite sure what you mean by “remaining out of Chinas orbit”.  China is their #1 trading partner and they are neighbors.    In particular- if this is the goal of the US to try and shape India into a world leader that promotes stability - shouldnt we really be negotiating trade partnerships and actually forcing some stipulations.    And hey maybe that’s what’s happening behind the scenes but it’s not really apparent to me  I’m just not sure how or if that is really happening.,[deleted],2024-07-12T00:13:12,1
">remaining out of Chinas orbit”. China is their #1 trading partner and they are neighbors.  And they hate each other, like actually violent clashes between military units hate each other. Additionally China and Pakistan have been getting closer.  >if this is the goal of the US to try and shape India into a world leader that promotes stability  Russia is slowly being forced to choose between India and China (for a number of reasons) the US is trying to increase the chances that if/when that happens India turns west (and towards maintaining the status quo) vs going down a more disruptive authoritarian path.  Basically the US wants India to see them (and the EU) favorably and be inclined to support normal relations (drone strike okay, invasion and seizing land bad). Especially if China tries to annex a neighbor.",ResidentBackground35,2024-07-12T02:33:15,3
