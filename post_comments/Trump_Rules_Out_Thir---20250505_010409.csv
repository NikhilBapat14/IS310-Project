Trump didn’t “rule out” anything. He couldn’t legally run anyways.,Stea1thsniper32,2025-05-05T01:40:07,328
This trolling is only pissing people off. He needs to keep his foot out of his goddamn mouth so we don’t end up with a Newsom for President next. He would rescind everything done on day one,aethiestinafoxhole,2025-05-05T06:00:36,224
"Midterms are in 2026. Someone needs to remind him of this. He has half the time that he thinks he has to accomplish his agenda, and he needs to stop wasting time and pissing people off with pointless shit like this. We WILL lose the house and/or senate in 26, unless he does an absolutely brilliant job of delivering on his promises - not just the action, but the *result*. His campaign was successful largely because he figuratively just kept pointing at the democrats and going  ![gif](giphy|l0HlvtIPzPdt2usKs)  Now he’s stopped just reacting to their insanity - he trying to provoke it. And it’s a bad look.",Left4DayZGone,2025-05-05T10:56:55,29
"“Trump explains trolling to dumbass democrats who take headlines at face value and suffer from terminal TDS” must have been too long for a headline  Hey brigaders:  your downvotes mean nothing, I’ve seen what makes you upvote.  Oh boy a Reddit cares message too! You sure got me, you morons..",chillthrowaways,2025-05-05T04:54:38,280
Only brainlets in reddit ever believed Trump was thinking of running a third time against the constitution.,Chikaze,2025-05-05T07:28:57,80
"Everyone with half a brain already knew this. He's a troll online, but in person, he is just an old 90s Democrat. That's not a bad thing, either.   His sense of humor is what draws young people, especially young men, to his party. It also keeps the puritanical haters in the left constantly on edge as a side effect, which makes debates easier for him.  He knows what he's doing. He does it on purpose. But he's also extremely transparent about it when you actually listen to him.   Haters gonna hate.",John2H,2025-05-05T10:04:00,60
No one but mentally unstable leftists thought this was ever going to happen. If you understand trump you understand he loves ruffling feathers of those with easily ruffled feathers. He has been this way since the 80s,Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-05-05T08:56:02,63
They won’t allow it. We all know they’ll pull this back out constantly and ignore that he was trolling and that he specifically said he’s not running again.,ITrCool,2025-05-05T06:52:06,0
He could run if they passed a constitutional amendment to allow it. But this rules out that he's seeking to do that.,therin_88,2025-05-05T06:25:01,-102
"Yeah, I wish Trump would stick to fixing this country and presidential duties and just shut up sometimes. He goes off on weird tangents that make no sense,",TheGame81677,2025-05-05T15:04:37,5
They were going to be pissed off anyway. He is just giving them something.,lankyevilme,2025-05-05T07:03:52,19
Completely disagree.  He just staged the biggest political comeback in history and HAS NOT CHANGED one iota.  He's the most authentic president since Lincoln.   Enjoy your upvotes ,TedriccoJones,2025-05-06T12:50:18,2
"Thank you for your concern.  Not that it matters because the media will just take anything he says out of context and make it sound like [he thinks Coolsville sucks. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrpukesetB4)  See ""bloodbath"" for the most egregious example.",ObadiahtheSlim,2025-05-05T07:26:31,-9

Congressional republicans need to get to work. The executive branch is doing the heavy lifting but the congressional side is doing nothing to enact the agenda.,jacksonexl,2025-05-09T11:54:06,1

"Exactly. The amount of morons I get, who send me chat requests and proceed to ask why would I vote for a person who wants to date his daughter or posts picture of himself as pope, is concerning.

"The fact that they even reported on it is insane  These insane lefties on here claim to be so knowledgeable in politics but don't even understand the constitution   I mean do they even know how a repeal of an amendment could be achieved?  At first I thought it was bots, but then the news reported it  Then I knew it was the DNC pushing it's talking points to the brainwashed populace via it's controlled media",CobraChickenKai,2025-05-05T11:10:11,-2

"His sense of humor is also a massive cost to him. Most people knew he wasn’t serious about the third term, but it just give fuel to the people calling him a fascist. His Canada jokes probably cost us  friendly Canadian government for the foreseeable future. I like a lot of what Trump does, but he needs to get out of his way.",ElCidly,2025-05-05T12:49:47,21
"Can confirm. I’m gen z and part of the reason I like Trump is his great sense of humor. No joke, after his presidency he could totally do a stand up comedy tour and it would be wildly successful. I went to one of his rallies last year and the dude had us laughing like crazy when he looked up at the jumbo screen behind him and saw the back of his head and went “holy shit do you see that? I’m having a bad hair day in front of Virginia!” lmfao",-yayday-,2025-05-05T12:59:03,-5

I wonder if those people realize how difficult it makes it for someone who has a legitimate issue with Trump. Their lazy criticism makes the actual good faith criticism get lost in the BS noise.,chillthrowaways,2025-05-05T05:58:36,6
