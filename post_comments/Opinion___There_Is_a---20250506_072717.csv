"""If a president acts in bad faith, it requires a sophisticated, multifaceted campaign to restrain him. Other parts of the government, along with civil society and corporate America, must think carefully and rigorously about what to do. Thatâ€™s especially true when the most powerful alternative â€” Congress â€” is prostrate""      ""Many federal judges, including most Supreme Court justices, have also responded sensibly. They have not picked fights with him or overreached. They have issued narrow, firm rulings directing him to obey the law. Only after he has ignored those rulings have they escalated. The [one-paragraph emergency order](https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/041925zr_c18e.pdf) that seven Supreme Court justices (all but Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas) issued in the middle of the night two weeks ago was particularly important. It blocked the Trump administration from deporting a group of detained men under the Alien Enemies Act. The orderâ€™s speed and breadth were signs that Chief Justice John Roberts and most of his colleagues recognize the threat that Mr. Trumpâ€™s bad faith poses.""      ""The past 100 days have wounded this country, and there is no guarantee that we will fully recover. But nobody should give up. American democracy retreated before, during the post-Reconstruction era, Jim Crow, the Red Scare, Watergate and other times. It recovered from those periods not because its survival was inevitable but because Americans â€” including many who disagreed with one another on other subjects â€” fought bravely and smartly for this countryâ€™s ideals. That is our duty today.""",SandyPhagina,2025-05-06T07:33:36,17

"The problem with this article is that it assumes we will not have a major constitutional crisis before the next election and that the Democrats will win back at least some control.  As if weâ€™re still experiencing the status quo of the back-and-forth between Republicans and Democrats.  I remember my parents fighting in 1959 over Nixon versus Kennedy, and have lived through many election cycles, but I have absolutely never seen anything even remotely like this. If this isnâ€™t an all-hands-on-deck emergency where the Democratic leaders are speaking out on every issue every day, then I believe democracy is a goner.",throw65755,2025-05-06T15:57:20,5

"Yeah, they lost me in the first paragraph. ðŸ™„ Most Americans do *not* support his immigration policies as they are being enacted currently. And whether or not Americans support it, ending DEI is an absolute recipe for discrimination. I also question whether *any* of his actions are legal.   This seems to be more BS ""I wanted rump's policies to hurt other people, not me!""   Literally every single action this man has taken has been to benefit himself and if it happened to align with the views of Americans that was an afterthought. I'm not going to play this ""He has some good ideas but . . ."" game. He is a racist, sexist, lying sociopath and America should be embarrassed that we even elected him once, much less this time.",Hippy_Lynne,2025-05-07T02:37:36,2

"Oh, brother.  It's only been 100 days and people keep talking about the potentially 'irreparable' damage.  That is short-sighted.  Once Trump is no longer on the ballet half of MAGA will revert back to being non-voters.  Do you really think that MAGA is going to be down with voting for someone who is not only Hispanic, but Cuban  (Rubio) or another Catholic and one who is in an inter-faith and inter-racial marriage (Vance)(to add, his wife's parents are immigrant academics in California)?  Or the one who Trump still makes fun of (DeSantis) or 'RINO' Haley or .....?  Not saying a Republican can't win in 2028, just that they would do so with a heckofalot less of the MAGA vote if they do win.  Pretty much everyone is going to go into a holding pattern until the next election.  Sure, some have no choice but to seek or create alternatives in the meantime, but it is not like shit is just going to vanish. Also in the meantime, stand strong and united.  The Fed Gov will take time, likely a long time, to rebuild, though.   Even Russia knows that a) Congress can flip in 2026 and b) Trump is out  in 2028 and because of this they are hesitant to work with Trump on peace deals.",crucial_geek,2025-05-06T11:05:19,-3
"Excerpt:  The patriotic response to todayâ€™s threat is to oppose Mr. Trump. But it is to do so soberly and strategically, not reflexively or performatively. It is to build a coalition of Americans who disagree about many other subjects â€” who span conservative and progressive, internationalist and isolationist, religious and secular, business-friendly and labor-friendly, pro-immigration and restrictionist, laissez-faire and pro-government, pro-life and pro-choice â€” yet who believe that these subjects must be decided through democratic debate and constitutional processes rather than the dictates of a single man.",D-R-AZ,2025-05-06T08:31:57,9
