Can I deport myself to New Zealand?,noforgayjesus,2025-04-30T15:51:15,13
"This administration is wasting so much time, energy, money on doing shit that is unconstitutional.  For Rubio to be saying this shit when there's already cases in the Federal Courts and challenges and awareness that those already detained only for suspicion and sent to another country with no due process is a bit of a BFD... is pretty bold.    Especially with his family history. Maybe he too fears that if he doesn't comply with Trump that Homan and Miller will detain him and put his ass on a flight to whoever the fuck knows where.    Just like people said ""Hey SCOTUS, giving Trump that much immunity means he could come after you!"" in 2024 - and look at the situation now.    Amazing how people warn that Trump has no low too low - and when he hits that bar, he goes lower - don't listen, and yet he keeps getting passes by MAGA Republicans to keep doing the shit.",Brief_Amicus_Curiae,2025-04-30T16:02:33,10
