"Idiocracy is not happening. When the government in Idiocracy found someone smarter than them, they deferred to his judgment for the betterment of that nation.  We're not so lucky.",Reedstilt,2025-05-07T09:13:06,126
"Nah, that administration was _WAY_ too diverse,  And they actively sought the counsel of the smartest man they could find.  No, we are much worse than Idiocracy...",wolfheadmusic,2025-05-07T09:38:18,53

"This is ""Idiocracy"" flipped on it's head.  If we get to something similar, the dumbing down will not have happened because of liberal policies and the lazy ""rabble"".  It will be due to the concerted effort by the right to undermine education, free thought, liberty, and the ability to work your way up in society (aka the ""American Dream"").  That is, it won't be organic stupidity as was depicted in the movie, it will be engineered and carefully managed stupidity.",MyStoopidStuff,2025-05-07T14:51:59,5

"Since 1980. One of the reasons Clinton got elected was Bush Sr. Sacrificing his political life and raised taxes for the good of the country.  If those who are Gen X look on the 80’s fondly, that’s where the generational gap will grow with democrats. They’re like my attorney who could have had my case dropped, but she held evidence without a word. Collusion? Damn straight, and with avoiding Reagan speech and saying the obvious, “ You can’t trust any of them “, at least one party supposedly champions food and shelter for their slaves.",REO6918,2025-05-07T15:12:15,-2
And they had a black president and I didn't once hear a character say he was ineligible to be president or that he was a secret gay Muslim.   We're in a reboot of Birth Of A Nation.,ruler_gurl,2025-05-07T10:18:48,57
"I feel like your government is weaponizing stupidity and illiteracy. They're not a bunch of idiots (per se), they know really well what they're doing.",G_Neto,2025-05-07T16:18:03,11
"That's my reaction whenever anyone compares what's going on to Idiocracy. This is way way WAY worse because here there's 77 million people who are actively trying to destroy the country. It's not stupidity, it's malice. Technically it's both but much more of the latter than the former. Hanlon's Razor stopped being an excuse years ago.",immortalfrieza2,2025-05-07T22:38:44,9
