"Maine and Nebraska have an [alternative method](https://fairvote.org/archives/the_electoral_college-maine_nebraska/) for allocating their electoral votes versus the normal [winner-take-all](https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/allocation#:~:text=Electoral%20votes%20are%20allocated%20among,number%20of%20its%20Congressional%20districts.) for the rest of the states.  Just to level set, each state gets a number of electoral votes equal to 2 (its Senators) plus its number of representatives.  Nebraska has 3 reps, so it has 5 total.  Maine has 2, so four total.  Texas, for example, has 40 votes (2 senate but its 38 districts).  So every other state just looks at the state-wide race and allocates all their votes to the winner.  So if one person wins Texas 51/49, they get all 40 votes.  These two states, however, look at the races on both a state-wide level *and* in each particular congressional district.  The winner of each congressional district gets its vote.  Then the state looks at the state-wide race and awards the two senate-generated votes to the state-wide winner, winner-take-all.  So for Maine (simply because its 4 and this is getting longer), you essentially have three races:  * District 1 - one vote up for grabs * District 2 - one vote up for grabs * State-Wide - two votes up for grabs (winner take all)",AuditorTux,2024-06-19T11:02:51,3
"A quick explanation of electoral votes are necessary.  There are 538 in total across the United States.  Each state gets two electoral votes that represent their senators (100 total), plus an additional electoral vote for each member of the House of Representatives from that state (435 total).  The last three were granted to DC as part of the 23rd Amendment to the US Constitution.  Most states award all their electoral votes to the winner of the popular vote in that state. Maine and Nebraska are different, as their state laws award the two electoral votes representing their senators to the winner of the popular vote in that state, and the electoral votes representing their House members to the winner of the popular vote within that congressional district.  That is why in 2020 you saw Biden win a single electoral vote in a Nebraska congressional district that includes a democratic leaning city (Omaha); while Trump won an electoral vote from a congressional district that covers rural Maine.",john_doe_jersey,2024-06-19T15:53:41,2
"To expand on /u/AuditorTux's answer, part of the reasoning (for some people) is that having more and smaller electoral vote units ought to itself to better representing the will of the people and should be seen as an alternative to something like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact for people who believe the presidency should be awarded to the person who receives the most popular votes.  But that reasoning is wrong. In practice, the Maine/Nebraska method if it had been adopted nationwide would not have changed the result of the [2000](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/instant/minimalist/index.html?appid=ec3ad6a61b334fb6b858e1f4e791c583) or [2016](https://wwu.maps.arcgis.com/apps/instant/minimalist/index.html?appid=fa9c111d9beb4ce3a6f4c684d59bdfce) elections (where the popular vote loser won the presidency), but it would have changed at least one recent election ([2012](https://wwu.maps.arcgis.com/apps/instant/minimalist/index.html?appid=b735f7e90a99437b9c499d7f01c7ffb5)) to award the presidency to the popular vote loser.  The reason for this is mostly gerrymandering. The ME/NE method repurposes congressional districts as electoral college districts, and as we all know CDs are subject to gerrymandering. So counter-intuitively, using larger state-sized blocs to apportion electoral votes ends up with a (slightly) better track-record of reflecting the overall popular will.",curien,2024-06-19T14:08:05,1

"I'll expand upon yours as well - one of the reasons people promote this sort of thing is that is ""expands"" the map requiring the campaigns to campaign in more places.    Texas might be solid red overall, but if that only guarantees 2 votes, Democrat presidential campaigns might visit Dallas and Houston for more than just fundraisers.  Those competitive districts suddenly carry an EV with them and are worth *some* trouble.  And that would go with every state that is deep red or blue.",AuditorTux,2024-06-19T14:24:26,2
