"We did a four year assessment of essential needs most likely to be in short supply back in January and stocked up over a period of four weeks. Cleaning supplies, Toilet paper, garbage bags, Sriracha, potatoes, cream cheese, and maple syrup. Other items we didn't need but expected to be near impossible to find after Memorial Day is baby formula and bicycles.  We have 130 days of perserved food in case things get really bad.",BoringThePerson,2025-04-29T14:04:24,4

Lol we have on street parking on my block but across the street this guy owns like 9 vehicles and takes up a big chunk of the available parking.  He keeps a old ugly Uhaul style truck in front of my house and almost never moves it.,sedatedlife,2025-04-29T13:09:01,1
