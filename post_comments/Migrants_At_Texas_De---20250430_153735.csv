"Another messed up part is that multiple people have come forward stating that these individuals who are currently being held hostage in the Texas facility aren't gang members at all. We won't know because the fat orange Dick Tater and Tom InHUMANE refuse to prove their guilt (or innocence) through due process.   If they're guilty, give them due process.   What's the problem? Would it make the Trump immigration policies tank as quickly as the economy because we can't legally or justifiably lock up innocent people in foreign prisons.",Financial-Special766,2025-04-30T18:23:44,35

Talk about pissing on the graves of every American that fought for OUR freedom. Democracy is sold to the highest bidder and the camps come back.  Anyone that voted for Trump is responsible for this.,SimTheWorld,2025-04-30T17:35:55,43

I saw this on Rachel Maddow's show last night and it absolutely terrified me. The fact that these people are silently screaming for help and are desperate for someone to save them... I was so full of fear when I saw that.,sachiprecious,2025-05-01T05:48:48,9

"Opinion: What a great way to spread fear and uncertainty amongst the immigrants heading for the states and border gang members, by a publicity stunt where prisoners are made to stand in an SOS formation for the press drone flying nearby. Pretending that horrific and untold happenings are taking place there.  One would have thought that no drones would have been authorised to fly within a mile of this place, let alone over the yard. Somethings fishy about this.",Loud-Ad9148,2025-04-30T23:51:56,-13
