"I'm sorry but are they dumb or were they pressured to do this?   Minorities and foreign students shouldn't be the ones protesting.  Protesting, especially when it moves past the benign peaceful protests and starts to occupy buildings and agitate police, should be left up to the whites.  Use your white privilege!",dbag3o1,2025-05-08T13:06:36,-6
The First Amendment does not include the right to trespass or the right to vandalize someone else's property. The young Turkish woman studying at Tufts was arrested for signing an op-ed in the student newspaper. Her First Amendment rights were clearly violated. This is not that.,Conscious-Secret-775,2025-05-08T13:16:39,2
"> Minorities and foreign students shouldn't be the ones protesting  Anyone who believes in their cause should be protesting. It's literally one of our god given rights.   >Protesting, especially when it moves past the benign peaceful protests and starts to occupy buildings and agitate police, should be left up to the whites. Use your white privilege  We don't need your racism around here.",Ouija_ghosted_me,2025-05-08T13:55:44,3
"Unless you can show that the administration is normally responding similarly to college students trespassing or vandalizing outside of a political context, it’s absolutely a violation of first amendment rights. By this logic, if they had said that the Turkish student in question was arrested for jaywalking or loitering, her first amendment rights would not have been violated.  Whether or not a crime has been committed is immaterial to whether punitive actions targeting residents due to the content of their political speech are constitutional.",coltthundercat,2025-05-08T13:52:12,5

"This administration would not know what first Amendment is, if it got hit over the head with it. It is absolutely as applied violation against certain groups. This is why these arrests end up going anywhere.",PsychLegalMind,2025-05-08T14:23:04,1
It is common practice for the Federal government to withdraw immigration benefits from non-citizens who break the law in some way. There are several LPRs in immigration custody right now and many who have been deported for committing crimes. One recent example is the Argentinian  son of two naturalized citizens who voted for Trump. He has a GC is not a citizen and is immigration detention because of a crime he committed.  The government has provided no evidence of any offense ever committed by the Turkish student. Nor has her university reported any disciplinary action taken against her.,Conscious-Secret-775,2025-05-08T13:59:31,-3
