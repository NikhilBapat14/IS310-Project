"I agree with this whole piece. Especially this part:  >The overwhelming majority of migrants come to this country for the same reason all of our ancestors came here: To make a better life for themselves and their children. For generations now, those entering from Mexico have picked our vegetables, made the beds and cleaned the toilets in our hotels, and laid shingles on our roofs under a scorching summer sun. In short, they’ve been doing the work that native-born Americans have been unwilling to do.  >To contrast that against an actual invasion, check out what’s happening in Eastern Europe right now. Notice that the Russians aren’t trying to get jobs and make new lives in Ukraine. They’re trying to kill the people who already live there and steal their land.  This is why it makes me so angry whenever trump or his cronies describe undocumented immigrants coming into the country as an ""invasion."" We in America should be thankful that we're not being invaded. Describing what's happening here as an ""invasion"" makes light of the suffering of Ukrainians and people in other countries that have actually been invaded in actual wars. If you think America is being invaded, you don't know how good you have it. Go spend some time on the front lines in Ukraine and you'll understand what an invasion is.",sachiprecious,2025-04-27T13:39:44,3
">Trump pretended his “Dictator on Day 1” talk was just a joke.  Did he? Or did the news media all pretend that?

Yet again, the news media is pretending like it was a total blindside that no one could've seen coming.",chowderbags,2025-04-27T14:04:20,3
"Trump never pretended it was a joke. *Other people* pretended it was a joke, but he never once walked it back. Same with him talking about a revenge tour. Same with him saying he'd take the guns first and worry about due process later in his first term. *Other people* walked it back, Trump never did. His disdain for due process and fundamental rights is on full display right now, but he has always been this person.   Trump is incapable of telling a joke, because delivering a joke involves considering your audience to deliver it. He can laugh at other people's suffering, but he does not have the ability to tell a joke.   What he can do is be weird. He speaks and acts in bizarre, nonsensical ways and his apologists try to call it a joke because there is no other context for it.",Rezart_KLD,2025-04-27T14:17:37,3

You can trace a lot of this back to prior decisions, going back to Reagan and Nixon, as well as e.g. Citizens United, but probably the biggest one was letting Fox (and eventually OAN and Newsmax) be nothing but right-wing propaganda with no regard for the truth.

People literally died for the right to vote, and throughout history, the groups most eager to convince certain populations not to vote were the ones who benefited from their silence. Voting alone might not fix everything overnight, but not voting guarantees your voice won't be heard at all. Saying it ""doesn't matter"" is exactly the attitude that leads to the problems we're seeing now",YuikonnuMashiro,2025-04-27T10:43:51,13

Well, we're gonna bump your rent up a bit."" Banks, ""Oh, you're doing alright, lets put on a little more interest, surely you won't complain, its just business."" Pastor John, ""Empathy is a sin, demoncrats, God hates everything on this planet including you so you better prove your worth to Him, also we increased the tithe."" All these people allied in the name of money and control and power, at whatever cost.  We slowly handed over the tenets of a good society over to the richest people around us. While doing so, we destroyed friendships, listened to religious leaders who helped us destroy our family relationships. Distanced ourselves more and more from our neighbors in what the owning class said was the ""healthy competition necessary to succeed in life."" Individualized ourselves to the nth degree. Lost the language of collective action because of course we did, that neighbor isn't our ally, our teammate. That neighbor is our enemy, someone who wishes he could take from us.  We allowed an almost narcissistic, self-centered mindset to become the norm in our life, and did nothing to quell the negative behavior that came from that. No, we enforced it.  The time for a general strike was long, long ago. And they were attempted. But it was already too late. This is no time for a general strike anymore. We don't have mixed living areas, towns and small cities, of differing political views. Our towns have radicalized into an incestuous pit of 'think like me or you're wrong' and its usually Conservatives that have that stance, so a lot of those towns LOVE what is happening. Those red-as-fuck towns are just as common in a red state as they are a blue state. Even our cities are starting to slide.  All the while accelerationists gained popularity as nothing got better. The internet amplified them but also brought on its own accelerationism in the form of the instant internet, making people feel like all aspects of life should be able to change so fast.  Republicans took over and made things worse, then Democrats took power and didn't do a damn thing to make it better, whether the fault of their own selves, or the fault of still being a minority to Republicans in the branches of government. People suffered more and more. Exhaustion and accelerationist rhetoric crippled minds.  And then came Trump. Who is a master of messaging. Yes, almost all of the messages are lies. But when he lies, and his cult spreads the lie, and then some much smaller voice comes and whispers, ""Actually he didn't do that,"" and no one hears that quiet voice... if a tree falls in the woods, and no one is around to hear it, did a tree fall? So for even the things Trump fails to do, when he lies and says he does it, it becomes the common belief. And due to this method of lying, Trump sure as fuck makes it look like he's getting things done *fast.* And that just further dooms us.  Deeper and deeper we go, into darker and darker days, with no one able to scream across this massive country in as effective a way as the Republicans can. You can't say 'general strike' to such a huge landmass of differing people, who do not even know the words 'mutual aid.' All you're gonna hear back is ""Nah, I can't. I gotta eat. I gotta pay for my housing. My car payment's due and I can't do *anything* without a car.""",aliquotoculos,2025-04-27T13:48:25,1

"Jesus christ, it's like you're trying to endorse the Republicans with every breath. The public values anti-establishment branding and showmanship above everything. The more anti-establishment branded candidate has won every election since the 80s, I would say. And the only three showmen-style candidates in the last 40 years were Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump (in different ways each).

I slammed Kerry very similarly, guess I'm bigoted against rich white guys who hang out on Cape Cod. Queer PoC, btw--hate that I have to get my bonafides out of the way.  >No one expects a male candidate to be perfect. But they do a woman candidate. So much so that reality gets reinvented - like some of your statements above.  So much wrong with this. First of all, using ""perfect"" here when she got nearly last place in the 2020 primaries and then became the presidential candidate with 0 voter input feels like a farce. I don't need perfect, but by the end I genuinely think Harris was less electable than your average person off the street would've been.  Secondly, people have hated our male candidates too. We have a serious problem where we think the public is desperate for low-charisma coastal lawyers turned Washington insider bureaucrats. That's kinda Gore, it's absolutely Kerry/Edwards, it's Hillary 2008 (why Obama beat her), it's even more Hillary 2016, it was kinda Biden 2020 but he got away with it 'cuz Covid, it was absolutely Biden 2024, and it was Harris 2024. Romney 2012 actually fell into a similar trap--good to see Republicans doing it too! There's a single throughline here and it ain't sex or ethnicity.  Harris is an awful candidate in a very similar way to how Gore, Kerry, Hillary 2008, Hillary 2016, and Biden 2024 were awful candidates. That was actually the problem. She was a continuation of the same legacy of awfulness that people've been pushing back against our party on for decades now. That's why the lack of primary hurt her so much--people had already been dissatisfied by the type of candidate we were running and the party had been interfering more and more in primaries to lock in a candidate archetype people hated. This time, we didn't even get a primary and we got someone whose only performance in a primary had been disqualifying.  >Low charisma? What? No vision? What? Yeah, tell me again just how accurately we can judge women candidates. Ho-Ly Shit.  Do she speak good? Obviously no. She got better between 2020 and 2024, but she was still like...a C-tier speaker. She wouldn't have been your worst performer in your average college speech course, but she wouldn't have been the best. There are great female speakers in the Dem party. She is not one.

"Well, the anti-establishment branded candidate has won arguably every election since the 80s and we've been part of an anti-establishment backlash that started before most Americans were born. So yeah, the public clearly values it. Trump was the only candidate swimming in the anti-establishment lane, which is why he was kinda handed a free win. It's also why so many people went from Obama-->Bernie-->Trump/AOC. Of course Bernie supporters there for anti-establishment rhetoric wouldn't flow to Hillary.  I mean, take a look at all the Dem presidents after FDR--without inheriting the position from a dead president. JFK, heavy anti-establishment personal vibes even though he was from a deeply political background. Carter, non-Washington Southern Governor with heavy anti-establishment slogans. Clinton, Southern governor ran on an economic change campaign harnessing dissatisfaction towards Reagan. Obama ran against the party in the Midwest and then did so on the national stage with another change platform.  People have wanted anti-establishment messaging for decades. People have desperately hated the economic status quo for decades. All of our successes harness that dissatisfaction. Harris, by contrast, ran as a pure status quo campaign. ""Not going back"" was her main slogan. ""No daylight between us"" was her campaign's stance on all things Biden--as we're seeing from the books coming out about that campaign transition era. She was nominated by the establishment with zero voter input.

"What change was the GOP offering?  Obama being elected doesn't mean racism ended.  Look at historical patterns for racism and sexism.  Obama's election follows the pattern.  Again, what policies was the GOP offering that were American first?  Not the rhetoric, the actual policy.",Rude-Strawberry-6360,2025-04-27T12:18:52,4

Revisionist history isn't going to help you.  (Trump lost hard in the primaries prior to 2016 but that doesn't matter in your analysis.  JFC)  You are accusing an ally and always voter (one who votes in every election at every level every time) who votes in support of you and yours a GOP operative essentially.  Tell me how that will help you.  Go out and volunteer and get people to vote.  Like I have for the past 30+ years.  Or just keep on with your screed.,Rude-Strawberry-6360,2025-04-27T12:13:03,3
No like they did with trump. He won the popular vote and he probably would have won in greater margins if more people came out.   Since you are so out of touch with the common man's lived experience let me explain.   People are suffering and have been suffering under the current status quo since 08.   They objectively despise it and when given the choice for change or status quo even if its a madman screaming for change most would choose the madman.   You can talk about most people not coming out to vote. But it's wild that you assume that if they did they qoupd vote for your status quo candidate.   They would not.,Greedy-Affect-561,2025-04-27T12:47:00,1
You are failing to address my questions or points which tells me this is too emotionally charged at the moment.   I am not attempting to be combative as The only way through this is unity.

"Trump campaigned on making America great again.   He’s lying, but that’s what he told the American people. It’s a message that resonated, just like Obama’s “Yes we can”, and “Change” messaging.   Republicans offer nothing, and democrats offer little. That’s the core of the issue. To throw the question back into your court, what tangible policies have the democrats offered that genuinely helped most Americans?   Obamacare? It turned into a regularity nightmare that ran most insurers out of town and left behind price gouging insurance monopolies (hint hint Luigi).  Harris’s plan to build more affordable housing? Obsoleted by the fact that she wasn’t going to tackle rampant institutional single family home investment. By 2030, 35% of all single family homes will be owned by multi trillion dollar investment companies like Black Rock.  Harris child tax credits? A small one-time credit when the cost of raising a child from 0-18 costs on average $300,000-$500,000 depending on what opportunities you’d like to afford to your child.  Small business credits under Harris? These were largely directed towards minority communities who would have benefitted, but leaves the rest of suffering America out to hang and dry. Not a successful or appealing campaign reform when the entire nation is signaling that they’re feeling the pinch.  Piping hot stock market under Obama and Biden? Only 10% of stocks are owned by retail investors. This largely helped corporations, and elite globalists.  Decrease in unemployment? It doesn’t factor in folks who stopped looking for jobs and it also doesn’t track folks who were forced to downsize their income by taking smaller paying jobs to make ends meet.  Democrats cannot even get things done in their own state and city strongholds. Democratic constituents being priced out of blue cities because the liberals cannot figure out how to build homes. Cali citizens wasting their life away in traffic because California cannot figure out how to do high speed rail, etc..  Liberals used to pride themselves on their ability to execute and achieve goals. Now, they pride themselves in entangling the nation in crippling bureaucratic red tape.",Gym_Noob134,2025-04-27T12:30:40,2

At this point you are wildly off the rails and are stuck in your own narrative.  I may be as well for that matter.  There is really no point in continuing this with you.  You don't think people voting matters or that it's important.  You think that somehow people will be motivated by a change candidate (see Bernie 2016).    I will note that it's funny you point to 2008.  The Great Recession.  Caused by conservative policies.  So people vote for more conservative policies.  And don't show up to vote against them.  Go out and spend a few decades volunteering and tell me what you hear for why people don't and didn't vote.  You won't like the answers - just like you didn't like hearing them from me.  I give you the gift of the last word.  Make it a good one.,Rude-Strawberry-6360,2025-04-27T12:54:14,2

"I don't look gift horses in the mouth.   ""The people don't want a phony Democrat. If it's a choice between a genuine Republican, and a Republican in Democratic clothing, the people will choose the genuine article, every time; that is, they will take a Republican before they will a phony Democrat, and I don't want any phony Democratic candidates in this campaign.   But when a Democratic candidate goes out and explains what the New Deal and fair Deal really are--when he stands up like a man and puts the issues before the people--then Democrats can win, even in places where they have never won before. It has been proven time and again.""   President Truman.   You want these people to vote. The party needs to get out in front of them and give them simple messages about their own material conditions.   Complaining about them not voting will get you nothing.",Greedy-Affect-561,2025-04-27T12:57:55,0
