"""Neuborne makes a case for the progressive use of federalism, or “states’ rights.” Although that doctrine is widely associated with opposition to racial equality, Neuborne cites sanctuary cities, as well as jurisdictions that mandate net neutrality, environmental protections, and more stringent regulation of the gig economy as recent examples of states using federalism to pursue more progressive policies. “Progressives should recognize that federalism needn’t be just a shell game designed to protect the strong…[but] is simply another technique for protecting the weak against tyranny or neglect of the majority,” he writes.""",Lebarican22,2025-03-30T11:51:38,3
