"This is one of the most frustrating elements to deal with among Trump voters. Before the election the conversation is all about the economy and how the president is responsible for it. After the election it's, ""the economy goes up, the economy goes down, nobody knows why it happens.""",RuckPizza,2025-04-30T16:44:42,58
"It's not the economy now, it wasn't the economy 100 days ago and it wasn't the economy in November either.   Anyone that truly cares about the economy already votes Democrat.   For the rest, ""the economy"" becomes their out when they don't want people to know that they are a complete asshole that's voting based on bigotry and ignorance.",Richfor3,2025-04-30T16:54:20,47
"The media missed the story with this.  Dedicated Republicans *always* complain about the economy whenever a Democrat is in the White House.  They are thrilled about the economy whenever their guy is in charge, no matter how bad that the economy may be.  Republican turn out increased in 2020 even though unemployment exceeded 14% in 2020 under Trump.  It's most of the rest of the population that is genuinely concerned about the economy.  That would include a modest margin of voters who vote only occasionally and chose Trump this time because he seemed to be a smart business guy.  Contrary to what Bernie Sanders may think, a lot of voters like the idea of smart business guys.  Democrats need to become the party of the economy and aspiration so that Republicans can't claim that title.  They also need to appeal to those who might vote for Dems if they thought that the party was competent in areas that matter to voters like them.  A lot of the right fixates on immigrants either because of racism or else due to their sense that life is a zero-sum game in which newcomers compete against them for scarce resources.  Textbook right-wing populism.",I405CA,2025-04-30T16:47:15,27

"***From Business Insider's Lakshmi Varanasi***:  On Tuesday, President [Donald Trump](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump) marked his first 100 days in office — for the second time.  I attended the rally, which took place in Macomb County, Michigan, just north of Detroit. I arrived at about 4 p.m. ET, shortly before the doors of the venue, an expo center for trade shows, closed. Trump was scheduled to speak at 6 p.m.  When I arrived, the venue was about three-quarters full, which felt surprisingly sparse for a milestone like [Trump's first 100 days](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-trade-war-first-100-days-tariffs-us-china-recession-2025-4).  [Protesters lined up](https://www.businessinsider.com/anti-trump-protests-hands-off-2025-4) outside. By 5 p.m., it looked like thousands of people were carrying signs, megaphones, pride flags, and dozens of inverted American flags — a signal of distress.  There were also several vendors outside selling hats, shirts, and other MAGA merch.  ""We did good,"" one vendor told me when I asked him how he thought Trump fared in his first 100 days.  The atmosphere inside was celebratory.  In many ways, the crowd was rallying around the downsizing of the federal government. But the White House [DOGE](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-musk-doge-government-waste-fraud-poll-2025-4) office was far from the top issue among the 15 attendees I spoke with. Immigration stood out as the primary concern in more than half of my interviews.

"Even my mom--who voted for Harris--fell for the lie about the economy. We talked the day after the election and she told me she was sorry that so many people cared about their bank accounts more than their fellow man. I shut that down immediately and told her that no, they cared more about *hurting* their fellow man. Trump and Vance spent so much time (and money) on lying about immigrants eating pets and shouting that Harris was ""for they/them."" The stuff about grocery prices, which Trump mostly addressed with incoherent musings on the word ""grocery"" or baseless claims about how no one could afford bacon, was a bullshit cover for the people who don't want to admit that they're racist and/or transphobic.",sluttttt,2025-04-30T17:03:40,15

"The fixation on immigrants serves to establish a social class that is below that of low income/low status non-immigrants who, all things considered, are staring down similar life prospects to their immigrant counterparts.  This is a way to quell resentment and grievance elevate a group that otherwise would occupy the bottom wrung of the socio economic ladder.     This type of politicking has been going on since this earliest American colonial days in Virginia when indentured servants (pre institutionalized slavery) were in open rebellion against their lords.  The lords worked to turn the violence of the servants toward Native Americans which provided the same foil for grievance and resentment as modern day immigrants.",worn_out_Shirt,2025-05-01T09:00:46,2

"I had a cousin that told me he’s voting Republican because Biden hurt his 401k.  This was like 2 days after the market set a record for going over 40k for the first time in history.    Like it was literally impossible to not make money.  His account could have been managed by a literal monkey banging in a keyboard and it would still be going up.  I asked him how that was possible given I was enjoying about a 40% return at the time, and if he was invested in Blockbuster Video.    That’s the joke with the whole family now.  Whenever he pretends to know what he’s talking about we just ask him how his Blockbuster retirement plan is doing.  Him and his dad are like the only two MAGAs and the rest of the family pretty much shun them anyway (including my aunt).

"Trump's greatest success was as an actor, when he was on a TV show on which he played the role of a successful business guy.  Sadly, some didn't realize that it was fiction.
