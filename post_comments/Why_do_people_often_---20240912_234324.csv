"It's hard to answer you without impressing the same political bias that you've injected into the original question. The short answer though, is that's hypocritical. The longer answer is that there are different reasons and justifications for different laws.   Criminal law generally focuses on retributive justices, restorative justice, or a mix of the two. Retributive justices is trying to punish people so that others won't do it. Restorative justice is aiming to repair society, for the victim and/or the perpetrator, so that they don't do that thing any more. The laws you're describing are retributive in nature. There is political capital in the areas passing these laws to punish people doing the things. There is no political capital vested in the types of policies you're describing. It's extremely well documented statistically that programs to help mothers and children, and common-sense sex education result in a FAR greater reduction in abortions than criminalizing the behavior.  We punish child abuse, but we don't fund and make parents go through parenting classes to prevent that, because there's no political capital in forcing that, even though it would probably help. What you've asked about applies to a wide array of issues, you just honed into two of the most obvious and politically divisive ones.",SYOH326,2024-09-13T10:54:28,13
There just aren't a lot of positive things the government can offer. A cash payment for not getting an abortion? That seems weird.   The negative options are a tax or jail. The positive options are a tax credit or actual cash. Not sure what other options there are.   Happy to be proven very wrong.,StillAnAss,2024-09-13T10:40:38,3
"ill approach the question a bit different from most existing answers in this thread. In general, positive metrics end up being gamed, see the goodhearts law of ""when measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure"". Good to remember that it initially postulated in the context of economic policies  so i feel like it's easier to tell people what to not to do, than what to do",trolls_toll,2024-09-13T12:23:39,2
"It's much easier to recognize an action that is detrimental and then punish it than to recognize something that is consistently beneficial and reward it.  Sometimes good things are only good within a range.  Too much and it becomes bad, but if you have incentives for it people will do it more than it really should be done.  Another angle to look at it is that it's easier to destroy than to build, and so also easier to see the more specific things that caused the bad than the good.  For example, to put up a house you have to do a lot of things right.  Which do you reward?  But to knock down a house might only require one thing that is bad, and so that is easier to identify and punish.  Speaking for your border and abortion examples: it's not that they cannot take sterps to reduce the alleged problem.  It's that:  1. Many people in power do not want to actually solve the problem because they can keep using it to fearmonger and rile up people  2. Some beliefs are ideological and absolute and people don't want to compromise, and so will punish anyone who does then go and get a compromise.",ptwonline,2024-09-13T12:29:25,1
"That isn't what the state is for.  The whole point of society is to make sure we all live by a set or social norms we all agreed to.  Political Philosophy believes that all humans are selfish and only put for themselves. We pool our collective effort to try and create a system that benefits everyone. But because everyone is selfish the system is designed only to punish and protect.

"I don't know the answer, but maybe it's just related to psychology. Most people are risk adverse and focus on the downsides more so than the positives. So, the law may be written in such a way to line up with that",etherend,2024-09-13T16:26:16,1

">Well, maybe instead of going militaristic on the border, maybe streamline the immigration process such that immigrants who would otherwise cross the border illegally, don't feel as intense a pressure to do so? Or you know what? Do both and tackle the problem at both ends.  >Another one is the abortion issue. Instead of banning abortion, might we not alleviate many of the conditions that cause women to seek abortion? As a pl person myself, this just feels more practical and would probably lead to less resentment.  Those policies are more or less, the current platform of the democratic party. The reason we don't do them is pretty simple. Anti-immigrant people are not just ""anti-illegal immigration,"" they want to curb legal immigration as well, so making to easier to enter legally is not what they want (also very few undocumented immigrants, actually crossed the border illegally)   Pro-Life people perceive abortion as no different than murder, and so, since it does not make sense to ""reward people for not murdering,"" they see no difference with abortion.",loselyconscious,2024-09-14T21:12:42,1
Agree ðŸ’¯. So many people in jail for white collar crime and drug possession charges could be rehabilitated rather than persecuted. Stats prove that recidivism levels are reduced if more time is invested in them. Incentivise people to get their GEDâ€™s or other recognisable achievements as part of their sentencing conditions.

"You seem to be coming from the perspective of the law and government on the federal level.  Generally speaking, you are free to do anything that doesn't negatively affect others.  ""Incentivizing good behavior"" has the assumption that law or the government (aka ""The State"") can give you freedom that wasn't already yours to have.  Welcome to The Enlightenment.  You have the most freedoms in a State of Nature without a State to compel your actions.  If the goal of Western civilization is to preserve freedom,  and we must live together, and you are your most free in nature... then The State can only take away what is yours in a State of Nature.  Without the State, you absolutely could kill wantonly with abandon, but doing so would negatively affect other people.  The State can incentivize by implementing programs not part of the law.  For instance, the Child Tax Credit to incentivize adults to have children.  But it is not criminal to be childless.  The levers The State can use (in the US) to incentivize something are limited.... for a reason.  The State can affirm existing freedoms or take them away.  The State gives you nothing.  Affirmed freedoms must be declared and exercised by you.  The fundamental role of The State is to take away freedoms.  Full stop.  The State's role is not to rehabilitate everyone who crosses the border illegally into functioning members of society.  The people, through their laws, have made illegal border crossing a crime.  The State's role is to remove that freedom of movement, not to process or normalize it.  This clarity of purpose informs everyone about The State's actions and their intended outcomes.  Most of the time, if The State wants to incentivize something, it does so through monetary means.  For example, tax exemption for churches or nonprofits like the Red Cross, tax credits, Medicare, etc.  The actual work performed and paid for by those incentives is done by someone who isn't in the government.  You basically asked, 'Why all the negative reinforcement?'  This is a long-winded answer to that question.  It is valid for the United States and a few other countries.  Those formed before the late 1700s and after the late 1800s may have a vastly different answer.",Impossible-Ad9065,2024-10-04T00:05:15,1
