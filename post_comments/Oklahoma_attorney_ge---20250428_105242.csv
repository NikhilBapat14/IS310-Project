GOOD. YES. PRAISE JESUS FOR THIS COMMON SENSE CONSTITUTIONALIST 🙌🙏   The Vatican and local dioceses have enough or can raise enough money to fund any Catholic schools we need. I’m catholic and this is a big fat no. If you allow this what’s your argument gonna be when one day some govt nut jobs start pushing for federally funded Muslim and Scientology schools? Keep religion out of the government 👏👏👏,Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-04-28T11:20:31,29

The answer is remove radical liberal indoctrination from schools not insert religion into schools. Full stop.,Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-04-28T11:51:37,14
"""remove radical liberal indoctrination""  That isn't going to happen.  The most that can be possibly achieved, based on a case currently pending in tge Supreme Court, is allowing children to exempt out of materials.",49thbotdivision,2025-04-28T12:13:33,-2
