">The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee estimated last week that it might cost **$12.5 billion** to modernize the air traffic control system. Duffy said he estimates this project will cost more than that. A display shows the status of flights at Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, N.J., Monday, May 5. National How archaic tech, staff shortages and construction made a meltdown at Newark Airport  >The Modern Skies Coalition, a group of aviation industry experts, pilot association representatives and others, issued a statement saying they **believe a minimum of $18.5 billion in additional emergency funding (on top of the $12.5 billion figure being floated)** should be appropriated over the next three years. And that's in addition to FAA's annual technologies and facilities budget.  In 2015, the Standish Group authored the ""Haze Report"". They analyzed a database of Government software/technology projects from around the world and noticed the following.  >Of government software projects that cost more than **$6 million, only 13% succeed**. But of those that cost **less than $1 million, 57% succeed.**  In the decade after the [healthcare.gov](http://healthcare.gov) launch fiasco, some very good people took this information (as well as private sector expertise) and did a huge amount of work to try and help the federal government do better at technology projects. They were rather successful when agencies would work with them and learn from them.  They could probably have pointed out how this will fail and probably even been valuable allies in actually making improvements to the ATC system.  Unfortunately they were all fired by the Trump admin the in last few months and the the knowledge and curated guidance they made available to federal, state, and local governments was deleted.     I predict that in 4 years, we won't have a safe and modernized ATC system. I doubt we will even have a ""modernized"" ATC system. But some very large contractors will make a ton of money.",aaprillaman,2025-05-08T21:27:34,4

"I agree with all your points.  I hadn't heard of the Haze Report before and I wondered about those figures.  I didn't read the Haze Report, but I did download and skim the same group's 2015 CHAOS Report (PDF: [https://wiki.sj.ifsc.edu.br/images/3/3b/CHAOSReport2015\_rev.pdf](https://wiki.sj.ifsc.edu.br/images/3/3b/CHAOSReport2015_rev.pdf) ) - it's only 11 pages long.  The report covers both public- and private-sector projects and, as I suspected, the government figures are comparable to industry figures.  For example, the ""successful"" rates range from 21% for government projects to 35% for banking projects.  The government's successful/challenged/failed rates (21%/55%/24%) are on par with telecom industry projects' rates (24%/53%/23%).  Also, big, complex projects (e.g., > $6 million) have a much lower success rate than smaller projects (e.g., < $1 million), regardless of them being government or non-government projects.  Of course, it should be kept in mind that (i) government projects themselves run the gamut of the private industry types (e.g., banking, healthcare, etc.) and (ii) a lot of the government software is developed by contractors.  Thanks for bringing the Standish Group to my (and others!) attention - it's interesting reading.  Like you, I have zero confidence in the Trump admin's efforts and I fear they will make things much, much worse.",theobook,2025-05-09T00:33:22,1
