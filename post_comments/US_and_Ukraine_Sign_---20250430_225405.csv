I feel so bad for Ukraine. Having to sell their future to get help from a despot.,Jamira360,2025-04-30T22:55:43,7
"As an American, I feel icky.   but it doesn't sound nearly as bad as previously floated in the media.   ""In a post on Telegram, Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, wrote that the two countries would have equal voting rights over the fund and that Ukraine would retain full control over its subsoil, infrastructure and natural resources. It also said that profits from the investment fund would be reinvested in Ukraine.""",Counciltuckian,2025-04-30T23:04:24,7

"Ashamed to say that it probably makes no sense to sign any deals with the USA right now. We've installed a collection of lying, greedy thugs whose ability to honor their own promises is nonexistent.",sleepingbeardune,2025-05-01T00:01:39,2
"Trump needs a ""win"" and a narrative to sell in order to reverse his plummeting ratings. So Zelensky should take advantage of Trump's obsession with his public image and get some specific security guarantees out of the deal, in writing...  Trump has the gall to claim that this war would have never happened under his watch. Nevermind the fact that he likely helped accelerate the current iteration of this conflict in the first place, or that his strategy thus far has been to insult, extort and escalate tensions with our allies, but keep in mind that he failed to ""negotiate a peace"" during his first term while he was cozying up to Putin and while Russian sponsored forces were waging war inside of Ukraine's borders throughout the entirety of his presidency.  Not to mention how Trump aided Russian proxies in places like Syria after he abandoned the Kurds and let Putin take US outposts. I mean, there's a long, long list of past Trump policies, rhetoric and actions that illustrate pretty damn thoroughly just how conflicted and unfit he is for the role of peace-broker here.  In truth, he's likely more interested in earning the title of something like ""peacemaker,"" than he is in actually negotiating any sort of lasting peace.  That said, and Trump being Trump, I think it's clear at this point that his admin cannot be trusted to follow through on what amounts to a mere framework of a deal at the moment, let alone any security guarantees.  Even if this deal manages to take shape in the future, and both the US and Ukraine commit to reasonable terms, *and* there is some vested, US ""economic interest"" in Ukraine, Trump still can't be trusted to suitably handle Russian aggression.  He also can't be trusted to uphold his end because he's an impulsive and vindictive narcissistic manchild whose attitudes towards others and his approach to foreign policy in particular can change on a whim.  The same way that Putin cannot be trusted to hold up his end of the bargain because he's violated practically every agreement since he came into power.  Not to mention Putin's imperialist, land grabbing ambitions rooted in a revisionist historical idea that Russia is destined for greatness and reincorporation (reclamation of its territory), and is fated to become a dominant world superpower. This is one reason why Trump seeks to emulate Putin, why he legitimizes dictatorship and has glorified him in the past. But it's also why this war is *never* over for Putin. There is no end to his ""special military operation.""  There may be a temporary pause in the conflict at some point, but any overture of peace from Putin will amount to a strategic move meant to give him some time to recoup and reorganize his forces, only to later resume his expansionist campaign against Ukraine and any neighbors that once sat on the peripheries of the Russian empire. While keep in mind, Putin is also determined to expand Russia's oil operation, which is just another reason why he's resolved to never end this war.   And don't forget that this all comes as the Trump administration has been floating a ""take it or leave it"" deal that satisfies nearly every single one of Putin's demands... Including the annexation of nearly 20 percent of Ukraine's territory, and territory that is rich in these mineral resources no less.   How can you take the Trump administration seriously when this recent deal also forces Ukraine to relinquish any territory it's gained while still allowing Russian forces to remain deep within Ukraine's borders. A deal that provides no specific security guarantees for Ukraine, that demands Ukraine end all notions of joining or cooperating with NATO, a deal that is contingent upon Ukraine formally recognizing Russia's annexation of Crimea, a deal that does not honor past agreements, and certainly doesn't respect Ukraine's right to self determination.",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-05-01T00:21:00,2

"Total whateverburger.   The idea this gives US any kind of investment in Ukraine's future is laughable.   We can all see what you're doing to yourselves for the same of enriching a few.

"The current agreement is actually more beneficial for Ukraine and does not transfer anything under the control of other countries, and if some points turn out to be more vague, then Ukraine can become a buffer to bypass Trump's tariffs. And given the volume of trade between the US and other countries, even crumbs from all this trade will be enough to ensure Ukraine's virtual self-sufficiency. Like, if I'm not mistaken, one of the points of the agreement is zero tariffs between Ukraine and the US without specifics on what this can apply to.",Annual-Magician-1580,2025-04-30T23:35:44,3
"It's probably the best you could realistically hope for under trump.   The only way the US under this administration would provide any sort of support is if we are getting something out of it  If this ends up leading to a ceasefire, Russia will surely break it eventually as they always do",ATLfalcons27,2025-04-30T23:41:01,1
