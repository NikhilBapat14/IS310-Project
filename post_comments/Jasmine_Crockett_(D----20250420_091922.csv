"We need to stop referring to the Garcia thing as a deportation and begin calling it what it is, an extradition.  His home country of El Salvador believes he is guilty of a crime, and the US has access to him. So we sent him to face the legal process in the nation where he is a citizen.",Tough_guy22,2025-04-20T10:36:35,65
"She's something else. On a similar note, does anyone think AOC is 100% going to run for president?",West_Consequence6288,2025-04-20T09:51:50,36
"Lemme try.  Donald Trump is more dangerous then-  * A cruise ship full of Africanized bees.  * The eventual Heat death of the universe.  * Being too close to a Black Hole. (Scientists should really think of better names for those things)  * Date night with Jack the ripper.  * Skydiving with an anvil parachute.  * Not having the high ground in a battle with Obi Wan Kenobi.  * Being Jason Todd in a retelling of DC Comics ""A death in the family"".  * Being a witness in a Clinton investigation.  ^(I actually think ""black hole"" might not be politically correct, but also ""Skotos"" just sounds cooler.)",atomic1fire,2025-04-20T14:10:41,11
I love Crockett. No better spokesperson for why the Republican Party is the sane and reasonable party than the Dems.,HereIGoAgain99,2025-04-20T11:52:48,22

"Crockett enjoys the publicity, strictly narcissistic!  The Texas lawmaker was accused of ‚Äúliving in an alternate reality‚Äù after claiming Abrego Garcia is ‚Äúa lot less criminal‚Äù than Trump when she was asked about Sen. Chris Van Hollen‚Äôs attempts to help the deported illegal migrant during an interview on MSDNC, an arm of the Democratic Party!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-20T09:56:30,7

"So what you gonna do about it then? These liberals are all talk and have zero solutions. You could try impeaching him. Just an idea, but its been done before with zero results. So whats it going to be? You tried attacking him in the courts, that just got him more support. So what do they do now?",Crisgocentipede,2025-04-20T23:03:52,1
"My prediction is that she's a Warren or Bernie.  She'll run and almost certainly get hype on reddit, but then when it comes time for the primaries, someone more moderate will win out and a bunch of AOC fans will feel like they had the rug pulled under them, only to be told that they should ""vote blue no matter who"", because whoever the republicans run is much worse then not just biting their tongue again.  Unless I'm wrong, in which case Hi agedlikemilk.",atomic1fire,2025-04-20T14:06:39,33

"While I don't disagree in essence, I am obligated to point out that Bernie didn't lose our because the Democrat voter base wanted someone more moderate (in the form of HRC)... He was forced out by the manipulation of the dnc by the Clinton political machine.",Shadeylark,2025-04-21T04:59:11,3
AOC can run with a 100% chance of getting lots of donations,woailyx,2025-04-20T11:11:59,11
"Fair enough.  My gut feeling though is that there's still some corporate influence in the DNC and they won't ""tax the rich"" without carving a bunch of exceptions because their donors would throw a conniption fit.",atomic1fire,2025-04-21T15:27:56,2
