We have an independent judiciary? I wasn't aware that the SCOTUS returned to following the constitution instead of the party platform.  Neat!,Grandpa_No,2025-05-07T19:37:09,89

Seems that all it took was for the administration to come after him personally with a FOIA lawsuit that aims to make part of the Judicial branch that appoints people become a part of the Executive branch so the administration can take control.,NinjaKlaus,2025-05-07T20:20:09,6

"Senator Barack Obama, [explaining](http://obamaspeeches.com/031-Confirmation-of-Judge-John-Roberts-Obama-Speech.htm) his decision to vote against the nomination of John Roberts (2005):  > The problem I face -- a problem that has been voiced by some of my other colleagues, both those who are voting for Mr. Roberts and those who are voting against Mr. Roberts -- is that while adherence to legal precedent and rules of statutory or constitutional construction will dispose of 95 percent of the cases that come before a court, so that both a Scalia and a Ginsburg will arrive at the same place most of the time on those 95 percent of the cases -- what matters on the Supreme Court is those 5 percent of cases that are truly difficult. In those cases, adherence to precedent and rules of construction and interpretation will only get you through the 25th mile of the marathon. That last mile can only be determined on the basis of one's deepest values, one's core concerns, one's broader perspectives on how the world works, and the depth and breadth of one's empathy.  > I want to take Judge Roberts at his word that he doesn't like bullies and he sees the law and the Court as a means of evening the playing field between the strong and the weak. But given the gravity of the position to which he will undoubtedly ascend and the gravity of the decisions in which he will undoubtedly participate during his tenure on the Court, I ultimately have to give more weight to his deeds and the overarching political philosophy that he appears to have shared with those in power than to the assuring words that he provided me in our meeting.  > The bottom line is this: I will be voting against John Roberts' nomination. I do so with considerable reticence. I hope that I am wrong. I hope that this reticence on my part proves unjustified and that Judge Roberts will show himself to not only be an outstanding legal thinker but also someone who upholds the Court's historic role as a check on the majoritarian impulses of the executive branch and the legislative branch. I hope that he will recognize who the weak are and who the strong are in our society. I hope that his jurisprudence is one that stands up to the bullies of all ideological stripes.  Barack fucking nailed it.",gradientz,2025-05-07T20:01:16,103
The only thing you can bank on here: the supreme court will *never* willingly give up its own power.  There's no way they rubber stamp away their own power.,absentmindedjwc,2025-05-07T22:45:29,2

"Judges in American courts operate their courtrooms like fiefdoms and are highly protective of their authority.  Insult them or act out of order in their presence, and they will quickly admonish or punish the offender for the show of disrespect.    Maintaining order is a priority.  This is one of those traits that crosses party lines.    DOJ has been practically flipping the bird at the judges, and few judges are willing to tolerate that.  Judges will circle the wagons around each other for something like this.",I405CA,2025-05-07T20:23:36,1
