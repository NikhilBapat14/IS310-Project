First sentence of the article: “Three black voters who cast ballots for President Donald Trump in November told CNN’s Van Jones in a Thursday segment that they do not regret their votes.”   The article was based on the feelings of three people.,Kincherk,2025-05-03T22:47:41,5
">“One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We’re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken. Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back.”   ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995",squintytoast,2025-05-04T00:00:31,5

"Van totally botched the ""authenticity"" hypocrisy. He should have asked redneck Stephen A. Smith and redneck Sherri Shepherd about Project 2025 and how Trump allegedly knew nothing about it but somehow is executing everything from it.",usernames_suck_ok,2025-05-03T22:48:31,2
