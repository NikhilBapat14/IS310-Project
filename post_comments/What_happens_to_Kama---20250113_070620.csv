"I think ex-presidents get their salary for life, not to mention secret service detail. The rules are similar for vice-presidents. They also get retirement pensions based on years of service and the VP counts as a senate member, based on their role as president of the Senate (having tie-breaking vote, essentially).  Short answer, Kamala Harris will be just fine even if she never works again.   This isn’t the best source, but it came up quickly on google and it’s easy enough to read.  https://meetbeagle.com/resources/post/what-does-the-vice-president-make-in-retirement",act_surprised,2025-01-14T05:47:29,40
"As usual, she will either go for other ""smaller"" positions or will transition into being more of a public figure and do speeches and book deals. I don't really know how much interest there is in her compared to people like Obama/Clinton though, so not sure about the latter. She's already announced a book:  [https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/kamala-harris/kamala-harris-potential-book-rcna187755](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/kamala-harris/kamala-harris-potential-book-rcna187755)  She doesn't seem to really like or be comfortable in public so she might stick to just politicking, especially since she's always been a career politician and is relatively young. Some were saying she might be doing a comeback and go for another run in 2028 but this really depends on if there's seriously no other contenders in the Democrat party in 4 years.  She might go for Gavin Newsom's Governor seat when it's up in 2026, she might try to get back into the Senate when there's vacancies. Some have even mentioned her as a potential Supreme Court candidate but people have pretty much suggested everyone for the Supreme Court. It would be kinda on brand for her considering her legal work.",TScottFitzgerald,2025-01-16T05:05:17,4
I wonder if her political career is over. I don't see her making another bid for the Oval Office,Over_n_over_n_over,2025-01-15T06:04:23,16
"Technically former Presidents get a 'salary for life' that's actually a pension payment - but a pension set up to effectively pay them the equivalent of a Cabinet secretary for life.   The VP is not entitled to that but is entitled to a Senate pension based on their years of service, as you mentioned, in their capacity as a Senate President but actually does not receive one in their capacity as Vice President.   Realistically, she would've been fine anyway though it doesn't hurt. Her husband is a successful lawyer in his own right. And she can frankly easily ship out books that people will buy and read.",PhiloPhocion,2025-01-15T15:36:31,4
"Lots of people run and lose but still choose to run again. Trump, Biden, and Clinton being recent examples.   The problem is she just isn’t that popular and I think the voters are going to want someone with less baggage.  She is a lawyer, so maybe she gets a cabinet position under a future democratic administration or even a judicial appointment.   I think I’d personally be happy to retire with all her perks, write a couple books and do the occasional speaking gig.",act_surprised,2025-01-15T07:11:29,24

"Yea, she should just hang it up because she's not going to win governor's race here in California so better to just avoid that embarrassment altogether.",weggaan_weggaat,2025-01-17T13:31:30,1
She’s done! Didn’t deserve to be nominee whatsoever-sooo glad she lost and we won’t hear from her again ,ConsiderationWild186,2025-01-20T09:02:02,1
"After listening to her this we on the news, she hasn't changed her ""word salad"" way of speaking. Whatever comes out of her mouth makes no sense at all. She would need a massive makeover to be a better candidate and actually have ideas that she can articulate to the American people.",4crynoutloud,2025-02-07T20:14:06,1
"I think we'll have to see.   While she wasn't popular before, and remains (actaully even less) popular among Republicans and nationally. She's actually much more popular among Democrats than she was before the election.   I think the other two big factors will be that she:  1. Wouldn't be running against Trump in 2028: whether someone manages to exert similar influence over the GOP and Republican voters broadly is a big question mark. Nobody filled that gap successfully while he was gone. There is some factor of whether that battle is easier won against whoever his replacement is and  2. How much blame she gets for losing 2024: which I think is difficult and I think no matter who thinks they know now, actually does not know how it'll be in retrospect in 2028. Unlike most losers, she was in a bit of a unique position in that she was viewed by most as filling in and abating what people were expecting to be a worse loss under Biden. Many Democrats now who view her positively see that story of her rather than her previously unpoularity.   And to that end, there's the obviously longer term 'what do her next few years look like' for her popularity. She ran a horrendous 2020 primary campaign and to be honest, that and being part of an admin as VP where she could not dictate her own role and her own image I think at best, trapped her in the image of that horrible primary campaign and at worst, left her to take more hits of the Biden admin than she could control. She was a punching bag.   I think the next few years will be hers to shape whether good or bad. And if good, to see if it's enough to shift that reputation.",PhiloPhocion,2025-01-15T15:41:26,9

"She could be in charge of making sure fire pumps have water... if she does that as well as she handled the border, California wont ever need another governor.,  I cant imagine what kind of echo chamber a person would have to live in to think she would even get elected for city dog catcher. She was a truly horrible candidate.  If I never have to hear her cackling again it will be too soon.",danbrooks3k,2025-01-31T17:07:02,0
"I think is might be more likely that she tries to be California governor. She repped it as a senator and was AG, so winning another statewide election is doable. With how blue Cali has become, the real contest is the primary, and the only person who can really challenge her there is the current lt governor, Eleni Kounalakis. But I think even there, Harris has the upper hand.",JustASumoGuy,2025-01-16T02:04:41,13
"I am predicting now that the Democrats will win the 2028 general election. We have been in a ping pong pattern. Two terms each during Clinton, W Bush,  Obama. Then Trump, Biden, Trump. I predict the voters will still be in a “throw the bums out” mood. But after the 2030 census, predictions are that Red states will gain 11 votes and Blue states will lose 11. That means the Democrats will have a more difficult path to 270. I am expecting the Republicans to have a pretty good run beginning in 2032.",Hazel1928,2025-01-17T14:15:58,1

"We'll see - it certainly sounds from her final few addresses that she's not ready to basically politically retire at this point - in which case there are few other options.   Governor, even of a state the size of California, is technically a step down (though I get the argument of it being actually a functionally and substantively more engaged role as the Executive and not a shoeboxed VP) but still. But again, if she wants it - it's probably the best option among what's out there.   I do think that primary could potentially become nastier than just that, even if not a genuine challenger. A lot of upstarts in CA politics that wouldn't mind the opportunity to raise their profile by challenging her and getting that automatic media bump...",PhiloPhocion,2025-01-16T12:09:19,1
