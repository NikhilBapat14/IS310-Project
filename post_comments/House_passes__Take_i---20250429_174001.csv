"Democrats still haven't learned their lesson about bills aiming to tackle real, serious problems but containing language that credible civil rights experts with excellent track records on predicting it say open the door to massive abuse and cause substantial harm while doing little to nothing, or even hurting, the victims it claims to protect. To say nothing of the constitutional problems.  Trump supporting this shit and salivating about using it to punish his critics didn't make a single Dem reconsider their vote?   Fucking disgrace. Another example of most of the worst freedom crushing bills being fully bipartisan. FOSTA, DMCA, PATRIOT Act and reauths, other mass surveillance bills, the entire drug war and related crime bills...  Have Republicans figured out they could get Dems to pass something like:  SAVE THE PUPPIES, KITTENS, AND CHILDREN ACT  1) Trump is now god king and any Republican may order the deportation to CECOT of anyone they believe to not be acting in the best interest of puppies, kittens, children, or Donald Trump.  2) No  evidence or due process shall be required. Truth of claims not subject to review.  PASSED, 536-2  Democrats: ""Well we had to protect these vulnerable groups, and we think the fears this could be abused are overblown and unrealistic.""  And they wonder why their ""but we're the lesser evil!"" strategy gets piss poor turnout letting fascists take over.",fafalone,2025-04-29T20:05:52,8

"Yea I see why some argue both sides are equally bad when it comes to these cases. I don't think it's always true, but for this, yes it's true they both are either dumb or evilly incompetent here.",Ok-Excuse1771,2025-04-29T22:12:47,3

"> Digital rights groups, however, have warned that the legislation as written could lead to the suppression of lawful speech, including legitimate pornography, and does not contain protections against bad-faith takedown requests.   The purpose of it is fine.  However, it's a simple extrapolation to see that this could be weaponized to take down any content the administration doesn't like, such as LGBTQ expression which has already been labeled as ""pornographic"".  There are no protections in this bill against this worry.  Or actual legitimate, legal, consensual content can be taken down for weird puritan reasons.",Gekokapowco,2025-04-29T17:58:53,18
"Like almost every bill passed by Congress, intended to fix a social problem, and even with bipartisan support (this passed 409-2, with 2 Republicans voting Nay), there is *always* the possibility that it will be used in bad faith because the bill wasn't written to be iron clad with appropriate protections for corner cases, or vague wording.  Given nearly 250 years of this process in action, acting like Congress has *ever* written a law that was perfect, that didn't backfire at some point in the future, and hence people aren't allowed to push back against it, is pretty fuckin' naive.",Acrobatic-Trouble181,2025-04-29T17:59:04,4
"Like others have said this is a well-intentioned, the provisions provided in its takedown system and overly broad language are insufficient to prevent its measures from being abused by bad actors who would use it to remove speech, images, and information they disagree, Congress could of fix this and put strong safeguard that protect everyone but they did not.  The worry is with the bill is there no real safeguard to make sure what being reported is in fact a deep fake and it gives sites only 48 hours to check, and a site would not need to make a appeal system if the wrong thing taken down.",vriska1,2025-04-29T18:08:55,3
