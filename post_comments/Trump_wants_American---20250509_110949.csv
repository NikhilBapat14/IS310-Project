"**From Paul Waldman, journalist and author:**  There is a familiar formula for a president to spin an economic downturn: acknowledge the public‚Äôs pain, explain that the administration is working hard to make things better, and reassure people with some variation of ‚Äúwe as Americans will get through this together.‚Äù Presidents keep applying the formula even though it rarely works, perhaps because nobody has come up with anything more convincing.  As President Donald Trump‚Äôs radical and chaotic tariff policy derails the economy and throws businesses into limbo, he and his administration have propagated their version of this familiar argument. A president whose entire life is a tribute to instant gratification and poor impulse control is asking us for patience and sacrifice. To put it mildly, this is not a deal he has prepared Americans ‚Äî especially Trump voters ‚Äî to accept.

"Declaration of Broken Contract When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for the people to dissolve the political bonds which have connected them to a governing body that no longer abides by its own Constitution, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all persons are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Justice. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to withhold consent, to demand redress, and to seek the restoration of lawful and just governance. The social contract has been broken. The government has failed in its most fundamental obligation: to protect and represent the People, as required by the Constitution. The sacred promise of representation (Article I, Section 2), due process (Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments), and equal protection under the law (Fourteenth Amendment) has been violated. When leaders defy constitutional limits, disregard judicial authority, and use public funds to abuse, neglect, or silence the governed, the moral and legal legitimacy of their authority collapses. In this condition, taxation becomes exploitation, a direct violation of the founding American principle: ""No taxation without representation."" This principle, enshrined in the Declaration of Independence and echoed in the Petition Clause of the First Amendment, affirms the right of citizens to withhold consent when governmental legitimacy is lost through systemic violation of the Constitution. Therefore, we assert that We the People cannot be compelled to fund a system that no longer honors its constitutional duties. To do so would be to participate in our own oppression, and further enable the erosion of our liberties. Until justice is restored, representation honored, and constitutional protections upheld, we reserve under our First Amendment rights, the right to withhold consent, demand redress, and pursue all lawful means of restoring a government that serves its people. LIBERTY OR NOTHING AT ALL --- GRIEVANCES --- 1. Violation of Due Process Rights (Fifth & Fourteenth Amendments) - U.S. citizens have been wrongfully detained and deported without legal hearings or access to counsel. Examples: VML, a 2-year-old U.S. citizen, deported to Honduras. A 4-year-old cancer patient, deported with family. Kilmar Abrego Garcia, deported in defiance of court order. 2. Violation of Equal Protection (Fourteenth Amendment) - Citizens of specific ethnic or national backgrounds disproportionately targeted for deportation or data surveillance. 3. Illegal Disclosure of Personal and Financial Data (Privacy Act of 1974 & Fourth Amendment) - Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) accessed IRS and Treasury data (SSNs, bank info) without legal basis. 4. Violation of ""No Taxation Without Representation"" - Citizens are being taxed by a government failing to uphold constitutional duties. 5. Suppression of Redress and Petition (First Amendment) - Citizens who speak out or file complaints face retaliation or are ignored.",These-Photo-5731,2025-05-09T18:08:22,1
