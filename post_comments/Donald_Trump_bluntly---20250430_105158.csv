For those claiming that President Trump was right here. Is there a photo showing MS13 on his knuckles? I've looked all over and can only find the picture with symbols and then the interpretation that it means MS13.,Conscious-Toe-4220,2025-04-30T12:01:15,1021

I thought this was hilarious. Trump basically slapped him upside the head. I wish more people publicly call out MSM for their blatant lies and disregard for honest reporting.,caffeinatedgoober,2025-04-30T11:46:36,-175

How about the court documents confirming he was part of MS-13? Or the testimony from his wife saying that she is married to a gang member?  Guess those aren't enough proof either?,Mr_0pportunity,2025-04-30T12:22:27,-464

"I don't trust any media, be it left, right, or center.  Anyone that single sources their news is living in willful ignorance.  The ignorant man sees what he wants to see and ignores the rest.

It is photoshop. He has tattoos on his knuckles but they don’t say “MS13”,Nyxaus_Motts,2025-04-30T17:38:53,230
"I didn't once question his gang affiliation. I believe if the allegations have been proven in a court, good enough for me. I'm curious about the tattoos. President Trump seems certain that there's a picture that shows him having a tattoo on his knuckles that says MS13. I'd like to see it.",Conscious-Toe-4220,2025-04-30T12:37:10,666

">  I'd like to see it.  Feel free to Google search the specific [picture](https://preview.redd.it/trump-posts-photo-of-abrego-garcias-ms13-tattoos-that-dont-v0-liy2bv84dove1.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=b0e3f4ac75cff4c068d2d36932542303842d0ec9) Trump showed. The knuckles have symbols on them that represent the M, the S, the 1, and the 3.  You can choose to believe the connection, or not, but why do you care so much since you're not disputing he's in MS-13?",Mr_0pportunity,2025-04-30T12:44:32,-343
Trump stated the alpha-numerical characters MS13 are tattooed on the man’s knuckles… why does he think that lmao,longinthetaint,2025-04-30T13:31:34,643
"I like to see this stuff for myself so I can form an opinion that's not based on what either person is simply saying. The President says the photo exists, the interviewer disagrees. In reality, the photo is an interpretation likely based on what I assume is fair bit of Intelligence. The interviewer was pointing out a nuance of the picture's interpretation while the President was taking a much harder stance. I think both of them probably could have eased up a bit during this portion of the interview.",Conscious-Toe-4220,2025-04-30T12:59:18,279
Yeah bud that’s not the way we do things anymore. You either believe everything the administration tells you or you are the enemy. So do you want facts and verifiable information or do you want to be part of the group?  When things really start going south we’ll have to come to terms with what we’ve done.,Nyxaus_Motts,2025-04-30T16:40:57,407
"""The nuance""??   The interviewer can get fucked.   The dude was picked up *together with two confirmed associates of MS-13* and the verification was done by the  *gang unit of the Maryland PD*. Hardly the sort of county where they pick up someone that looks like the wrong color.   Did you know abrego Garcia wasn't alone when he was arrested by Maryland PD? That he was with two others also identified as MS13 and *not a single one of the news media* has **maaaaaybe** asked themselves if they can look at one of the other suspects rap sheet and then draw a logical conclusion that perhaps someone hanging out with not one but two hard-core gang members with gang tattoos might not be a construction worker.   So yeah, please kindly ask the MSM to get fucked. This picture is maybe the weakest (albeit still very damning) piece of evidence in trump's case.",funny_flamethrower,2025-04-30T19:43:42,-50
"Buddy, calm down. No one here is denying what courts have asserted and held up - that there is sufficient information to claim that Garcia is affiliated with a gang. I'm specifically picking on a questionable assertion by President Trump about the existence of alphanumeric tattoos on Gracia's knuckles. If I have an opinion on the matter it's that the President needs to stick to the facts and defer to the justice department on legal matters.",Conscious-Toe-4220,2025-04-30T20:36:58,92
