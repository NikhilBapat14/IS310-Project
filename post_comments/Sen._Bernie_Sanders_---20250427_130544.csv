"So, Trump voters want one of two things or often both!  They are either motivated by white nationalism or material concern. Americans know that the state is not doing anything to improve their material lives. They are getting poorer and poorer and the cost of living keeps going up. But, because Americans are not politically literate ‚Äì ‚Äì and that includes both Democrat and Republican voters ‚Äì ‚Äì they vote arbitrarily for people who seem to be outside of the political establishment, without understanding that the ideology of the candidate is crucial to creating GENUINE opposition to the ideological interests of the state.

">This BS keeps getting regurgitated by tons of progressives.   This truth is now being stated openly by experts all around the world. These people know what they are talking about and know why the American political system is completely broken and corrupted by the 1% now.   You might just want to give them a listen.  >Dems impeached Trump.   Knowing that the GOP would never convict him. And knowing that even if he was convicted, another Republican would step in. There was no chance we'd get a good president from this procedure. What we would get is one who isn't completely fucking crazy. Wall Street, as you may have noticed recently, if fine with corruption, just not fucking crazy.  >They‚Äôve never impeached a progressive, or had one removed from office.  We've never had a progressive president. The only one who was even close was Obama. And from that moment on, the DNC donors locked down the last three general election nominations to make sure that only corporate status quo Democrats would be their general election candidate.   Progressives are not longer allowed to get close to the White House.  The donor-owned DNC have, however, sandbagged Sanders during the general election primaries not once, but twice, in the most openly corrupt ways ever seen in any modern democracy. And when it came to replacing Biden this time around, the DNC donors deliberately bypassed any chance of a primary, debates, or brokered convention (the specific system designed for just such a contingency) by picking corporate stooge #2 for the ticket...without involving the electorate at all.   Didn't you find it suspicious that they picked a replacement nominee for *us* less than 24 hours after Biden stepped out?  Instead of nominating someone who could excite the base to beat Trump, they chose yet another corporate status quo Democrat. It was a ""change from the Biden administration"" election and they chose Biden's #2 -- a candidate so unpopular that she had dropped out of the primaries in 2020 even before last place candidate Joe Biden.  Does that make any sense to you whatsoever?  Then they just blocked AOC for a leadership position...and on and on.   Thanks to our corrupt private campaign financing system, the DNC is owned by the 1% now (just like the RNC). They are fine with low taxes on the 1% and maintaining the status quo where the 99% don't get healthcare, a livable wage, etc. And they are fine with any GOP leader that cuts their taxes even further.   Either way, they win and we lose.  >They spend orders of magnitude more time and money fighting Republicans than they do progressives.  They do not. Remember that the money that funds both sides of these elections comes from the same multi-millionaires and billionaires. It's just two groups of rich people fighting it out between each other for power and profit. And that money comes right back to them because it's used by our politicians to buy millions in air time for political ads that should be allocated, free, and fair on the national airwaves -- as every other democracy does.   So, it's their money buying off our entire political class which ends up coming right back to them...  And, most importantly, we don't matter anymore.

"Milquetoast Dems may not have sat in the cab and helped Republicans push the levers that swing wrecking balls into our nation, but they've certainly removed roadblocks for that equipment and gassed the tank.  Entropy exists. It's the natural order of things to get worse and break down. We have to expend **energy and effort** to overcome that entropy and stay where we are, and even more to go beyond that and build new things. And when we're faced with an intelligent destructive force like Republicans, we need to go even further.   Republicans are always going to be smashing things down, so if the best Dems can say is ""we'll try to *limit* their damage"", we continue to backslide. We need to fight back, prevent them from doing damage entirely, rebuild what they've broken, perform maintenance on everything else, *and* build new things. Centrist Dems aren't up to that task.  Case in point: conservatives shot *Roe* in the gut because Democrats didn't take the several opportunities in my lifetime when they had control of Congress and the Presidency to enshrine it into rock-solid law rather than SCOTUS shrugging. And I've got no doubt that if someone like Biden had won a second term *and* gotten a slim majority in both houses of Congress for two years or even his whole term that he'd use the bully pulpit to push them to do it.

"It also imagines that elections are decided purely on the voting public's belief in a candidate's policies.  We see time and time again that very progressive policies--more left-wing than the average Democratic Congressman--are approved even as voters pick candidates who are diametrically opposed to them. The voting public has no problem saying ""I think abortion should be legal"" and, in the next breath, ""And I'm voting for the guy who wants to outlaw even *saying* my previous statement"".  Who parties support and who gets air time (paid or not) also has a large influence on the outcome. It is quite easy to design a system where more of the public wants progressive Democrats but conservative Democrats win more races: you, the guy with control of the coffers, fund and message for the latter instead of the former. Which is exactly what we see, with the DNC even going so far as to inject third-runners into races between more progressive Dems and Republicans despite the risk that it hands the win to a Republican. Moneyed groups *outside* of the DNC also operate this way, but they don't have the theoretical motivation of ""wanting to win elections""--for them, it's pure self-servingeconomics... and the same is true for centrist Dems!

You‚Äôre not engaging with my point at all. Either Bernie had no sway or effect at all or the Democrats need to listen to him or they‚Äôll keep losing?

"Okay here's what you aren't understanding are you rural because if so you will not have a medical center within short driving distance if medicare and medicaid disappear.  It's not about whether you can pay for it, it's that there will not be providers within reasonable distances because they will not be able to afford to stay open and provide care.  In the US providers are obligated to provide care if someone shows up regardless of whether or not they have insurance.  If they don't have insurance the provider doesn't get paid if the provider doesn't get paid they close their doors.    The medical system barely survived the stress of covid and that was when everyone had to have insurance.  The dems are not currently in control the people in control want you to think that a regressive tax is paid by the country being tariffed rather than the citizens of the country imposing the tariff.",redditlvlanalysis,2025-04-27T21:41:25,2

If you want to stop the oligarchy you must not criticize the Democratic Party.   If Bernie Sanders wants to stop the oligarchy Bernie Sanders must not criticize the Democratic Party.   If Bernie Sanders wants to stop the oligarchy Bernie Sanders must endorse the unprecedented surprise candidate put forth by the Democratic Party in lieu of primary elections no more than 120 hours from when their candidate is announced.      There‚Äôs not one iota of logical sense with any of those statements.      >Either Bernie had no sway or effect at all or the Democrats need to listen to him or they‚Äôll keep losing? Bernie fans never seem to make up their mind when called out on this.      Bernie had about as much sway or effect as an independent senator from Vermont could reasonably be expected to have. Is the Democratic Party a major political party or are they subject to Bernie‚Äôs whims of varying mercy? Why would democrats need to listen to Bernie to stop losing elections?

"Polls didn‚Äôt ‚Äúfail to predict Trump‚Äôs victory‚Äù they always showed him with a large chance of winning.  What polls were you reading?  I create algorithms to analyze large data sets to find patterns which people can‚Äôt easily see. For instance, we analyze security data to find insider threats and vulnerabilities within large scale software and hardware deployments.  I‚Äôve also worked extensively with marketing data to predict and manipulate people into buying things they don‚Äôt really need or want. I don‚Äôt do that anymore because I think the work is kind of evil.  The same types of manipulation work for politics though. It‚Äôs pretty blatantly clear that Meta and TikTok uses the same ideas to push what sells (and currently that‚Äôs Republican politics)",mightcommentsometime,2025-04-28T16:26:28,2
No it's fact.  The vast majority of rural occupants are reliant on one of if not both of medicare and medicaid.  Rural doctors do not run significantly profitable businesses if they start having to give service for free they will close up.  Without doxing myself I was doing work within the medical system during covid and saw just how close to the redline a lot of rural medical centers were running.,redditlvlanalysis,2025-04-27T21:44:07,2
"I feel ya.  Traditional polling failed. If I and other old people like me were paying attention to the type of science you do, maybe alarms would have been raised earlier.

I want progressive leadership that provides basic needs(healthcare/housing/higher education) to all Americans. I want the bar raised so an asshat like Trump is never an option again.

Why in the world would they do that?  Private insurance companies exist to make a profit medicare and medicaid cover people who can't pay for private insurance due to lacking funds.  We don't have single payer health care in the us because it was successfully demonized by republicans largely funded by private insurance lobbyists.  The best we got was the ACA aka Obamacare and that was an even more stripped down version of a republican health plan that they all still voted against.  The people we are talking about aren't even able to afford that.  Also the issue isn't having insurance companies closer to rural residents it's that the medical systems in rural towns will be running an active loss and as such will close.  The doctors there will have to move to the cities to feed their families.,redditlvlanalysis,2025-04-27T21:48:53,2

do you think hospitals in the city make most of their  money because of medicare/caide? because if so taking that away would force them to go to where people actually pay,10it35,2025-04-27T22:01:18,1
