Likewise, the nitpicking over ""food insecurity"" makes no sense.  ""Food insecurity"" isn't the same as ""hungry.""  ""Hunger"" makes you envision starving people in abject poverty, whereas food insecurity is something that working class people often experience from time to time.  My family was never *hungry* but there were definitely times when my parents struggled to afford groceries while paying all of their other bills.

I’m glad his strategy in 1959 wasn’t “We get everything now, or we burn it all down”. Had that happened, the 1964 Civil Rights Act would still be a fantasy. Plus,I hope you don’t believe that act didn’t come with a lot of “compromises”.

Voters see Dems as the party of the status quo, and even Tim Walz criticized the campaign for not addressing that. They stifle their younger talent and have very poor coordination on alternative media. They can’t take “oligarchy” and brand it as a term that favors them, unlike the way Republicans and Trump brand everything. “DEI” is harder to understand than “oligarchy” but which one played a bigger role in the election?

"So, Trump voters want one of two things or often both!  They are either motivated by white nationalism or material concern. Americans know that the state is not doing anything to improve their material lives. They are getting poorer and poorer and the cost of living keeps going up. But, because Americans are not politically literate – – and that includes both Democrat and Republican voters – – they vote arbitrarily for people who seem to be outside of the political establishment, without understanding that the ideology of the candidate is crucial to creating GENUINE opposition to the ideological interests of the state. Democrats don’t get this either. They elect neoliberals to solve problems that neoliberals don’t think are problems. They celebrate Corey Booker on the one hand and then complain about how evil insurance companies are on the other. Guess who pays Corey?  So, they are not motivated by stupidity any more than Democrats are motivated by being slightly better educated, and it is not stupidity that leads them to these conclusions. Americans are not educated to be politically savvy, or to have any ideological understanding of politics that would equip them to know who will act in their material interests or even what their material interests are.   You are just as guilty of this as they are. You don’t have any real, coherent ideologically consistent vision for society. Democratic voters are primarily motivated by Trump. All you guys know is that Trump is bad and that beating Trump is good. All you know is slight incremental improvement without any kind of overarching ideologically consistent vision for society. You don’t even understand how voting for neoliberal Democrats is not a meaningful threat to Trump and are surprised that we got Trump again — even though NONE of the conditions that produced Trump have been addressed in the slightest iota.

"I went to the rally in Folsom a few weeks ago. My main takeaways were this:   1. Call your representatives. Email them. Show up at town halls. Hound them. If they are not actively fighting against Trump's regime, Republican or Democrat, give them no peace.   2. One line that stuck out to me in particular was AOC saying that perhaps the most important reason for these rallies was to build community. She asked us to look around, and see all the faces standing next to us who feel the same way we do about what's going on. She asked us to introduce ourselves to the person standing next to us, exchange contact info, start organizing. Come together instead of standing apart.   3. The sheer act of getting these rallies on the news is going to inspire even people who never attend one. Thousands of people showed up in Idaho of all places. It's much harder to act if we think we're going to be acting alone. Letting all the sane people in the country know that they're not alone might just tip the tide. Maybe someone will go to a protest next month who wouldn't have. Maybe someone will donate to a legal fund or campaign who wouldn't have.

">This BS keeps getting regurgitated by tons of progressives.   This truth is now being stated openly by experts all around the world. These people know what they are talking about and know why the American political system is completely broken and corrupted by the 1% now.   You might just want to give them a listen.  >Dems impeached Trump.   Knowing that the GOP would never convict him. And knowing that even if he was convicted, another Republican would step in. There was no chance we'd get a good president from this procedure. What we would get is one who isn't completely fucking crazy. Wall Street, as you may have noticed recently, if fine with corruption, just not fucking crazy.  >They’ve never impeached a progressive, or had one removed from office.  We've never had a progressive president. The only one who was even close was Obama. And from that moment on, the DNC donors locked down the last three general election nominations to make sure that only corporate status quo Democrats would be their general election candidate.   Progressives are not longer allowed to get close to the White House.  The donor-owned DNC have, however, sandbagged Sanders during the general election primaries not once, but twice, in the most openly corrupt ways ever seen in any modern democracy. And when it came to replacing Biden this time around, the DNC donors deliberately bypassed any chance of a primary, debates, or brokered convention (the specific system designed for just such a contingency) by picking corporate stooge #2 for the ticket...without involving the electorate at all.   Didn't you find it suspicious that they picked a replacement nominee for *us* less than 24 hours after Biden stepped out?  Instead of nominating someone who could excite the base to beat Trump, they chose yet another corporate status quo Democrat. It was a ""change from the Biden administration"" election and they chose Biden's #2 -- a candidate so unpopular that she had dropped out of the primaries in 2020 even before last place candidate Joe Biden.  Does that make any sense to you whatsoever?  Then they just blocked AOC for a leadership position...and on and on.   Thanks to our corrupt private campaign financing system, the DNC is owned by the 1% now (just like the RNC). They are fine with low taxes on the 1% and maintaining the status quo where the 99% don't get healthcare, a livable wage, etc. And they are fine with any GOP leader that cuts their taxes even further.   Either way, they win and we lose.  >They spend orders of magnitude more time and money fighting Republicans than they do progressives.  They do not. Remember that the money that funds both sides of these elections comes from the same multi-millionaires and billionaires. It's just two groups of rich people fighting it out between each other for power and profit. And that money comes right back to them because it's used by our politicians to buy millions in air time for political ads that should be allocated, free, and fair on the national airwaves -- as every other democracy does.   So, it's their money buying off our entire political class which ends up coming right back to them...  And, most importantly, we don't matter anymore.

"Milquetoast Dems may not have sat in the cab and helped Republicans push the levers that swing wrecking balls into our nation, but they've certainly removed roadblocks for that equipment and gassed the tank.  Entropy exists. It's the natural order of things to get worse and break down. We have to expend **energy and effort** to overcome that entropy and stay where we are, and even more to go beyond that and build new things. And when we're faced with an intelligent destructive force like Republicans, we need to go even further.   Republicans are always going to be smashing things down, so if the best Dems can say is ""we'll try to *limit* their damage"", we continue to backslide. We need to fight back, prevent them from doing damage entirely, rebuild what they've broken, perform maintenance on everything else, *and* build new things. Centrist Dems aren't up to that task.  Case in point: conservatives shot *Roe* in the gut because Democrats didn't take the several opportunities in my lifetime when they had control of Congress and the Presidency to enshrine it into rock-solid law rather than SCOTUS shrugging. And I've got no doubt that if someone like Biden had won a second term *and* gotten a slim majority in both houses of Congress for two years or even his whole term that he'd use the bully pulpit to push them to do it.

Guess who had the more popular message? We could have met that with a better canidate, but Principled Centrists told us we just needed a ""safe"" one, just like 2016.      Poli Sci 101 means knowing parties have agency. Voters in a first past the post system don't have that same agency, all they have is choices. You wanting to blame voters is a literal sad, pathetic, little pansy ass b*tch move to avoid having to admit that the PARTY is the one that should be changing, vs a pissed off, useless centrist upset that people aren't eating the same slop they're usually served. What horrible people voters must be to want canidates that will bring change, even if it's a horrible kind of change. I find you and your ilk cowardly, slimy people that hate having their arguments pinned down to where they can't slither out of what they're doing.      Another point: Nancy Pelosi isn't on the House leadership team, but her maneuvering cost AOC a committee seat and gave it to a throat cancer patient that really should be recieving treatment vs moonlighting as an effective representative. That's certainly unfair and unethical but no one cares. I point this out to highlight these ""ethics"" pushed by Centrist Dems only exist as it pertains to elections, anything the party does post that is fair game.      I know a lot of people trying to figure out how to run. David Hogg's PAC would be supporting outsider canidates with the goal of ousting party old heads. So just to be clear here, you want more people to run, you just don't think it's okay for the Vice Chair of the DNC to push his agenda. However, Centrist Dems running the DNC are enabled to keep funding people that just so happen to be centrists every single time. Is that correct? They specifically avoid funding progressives and refuse to try and take steps to fix the bad blood. This is pure arrogance considering they can't win now without grassroot progressive support - we've already proved that.      It's actually incredible, the response to fascism has been a slide to the center to pick up non-existent moderates vs energizing the left and the majority of people who long and dream for real change. The Centrist moderate defends this and cries about losing power because they don't think it's fair. That slide cost us 2024 and was part of the reason we lost 2016. Ideas win elections. Centrist Democrats do NOT have ideas, regardless of how hard people want to pretend they do, we can see that clearly by whose actually trying to engage with voters and who isn't.

Predicting what people like about a political candidate is not something easily determined with an algorithm.  You’re working on the old paradigm. We don’t try to “predict” what people want so much as make them want specific things through advertising manipulation and targeted ads based on their information. We take info about these people (publicly available, or available through the many programs people sign up for that give out there data), and use that information to craft the proper things to trigger dopamine release and impulses to buy shit. That type of manipulation is why I got out of the advertising side and moved over to analyzing economic, health and security data.  The same does happen with politics, that’s why Meta and X have been effective marketing platforms to push GOP propaganda. The same algorithms that work to manipulate people into buying things work to manipulate them into voting certain ways.  But politics have 1 thing that shopping and consumerism does not. Elections are a specific event with a direct measurement of what people vote on. They’re a golden data set that is much easier to analyze for some of the big broad claims.  For instance, the claim that moderates perform better than progressives is easy to show using the election data.  Elections don’t have “margins of error” because they are the empirical evidence themselves. They’re the event being measured, and not a prediction of that event.  Analyzing how people voted when we have clear historical trends set on exact timelines is much easier than you seem to think. It’s clear that progressives have not been doing much to expand their reach of the electorate for years.

More people may have voted.  I will resign with this. I don’t want middle of the road attrition. I want progressive leadership that provides basic needs(healthcare/housing/higher education) to all Americans. I want the bar raised so an asshat like Trump is never an option again.  So while your data may prove that moderates win elections. It still doesn’t affect the type of change we need in the timeframe required. At least not IMHO.

"id assume that private insurance company’s would open closer to the actual insurance payers the reason they don’t now is cause the subsidies from the government to be in cities, so like i said this all sounds like your opinion",10it35,2025-04-27T21:45:53,1
"I actually agree with you. I want progressive leaders and big changes. I just don’t think they’re going to be winning in this environment, and that sucks for our futures and that of our kids. Maybe one day though  Cheers!",mightcommentsometime,2025-04-28T16:44:50,2
Why in the world would they do that?  Private insurance companies exist to make a profit medicare and medicaid cover people who can't pay for private insurance due to lacking funds.  We don't have single payer health care in the us because it was successfully demonized by republicans largely funded by private insurance lobbyists.  The best we got was the ACA aka Obamacare and that was an even more stripped down version of a republican health plan that they all still voted against.  The people we are talking about aren't even able to afford that.  Also the issue isn't having insurance companies closer to rural residents it's that the medical systems in rural towns will be running an active loss and as such will close.  The doctors there will have to move to the cities to feed their families.,redditlvlanalysis,2025-04-27T21:48:53,2
"you are assuming i am for government health care, a large majority of my community uses the same health insurance a drive is about 15 mins in our town it’s not a crazy drive. my family also isn’t a bunch of bums so any elderly family members will pull together to take them for appointments, you are arguing just to argue, you haven’t told me one thing the dems have done for me stop shifting the conversation",10it35,2025-04-27T21:52:10,1
"It has nothing to do with the location of health insurance providers?  https://ruralhospitals.chqpr.org/Problems.html  But hey have fun driving 100 plus miles for appointments because what's going to happen, the vast majority of rural hospitals will close and only cities will be left open.  The only primary funding source for rural hospitals that isn't actively losing them money is medicare that includes private insurance.",redditlvlanalysis,2025-04-27T21:57:25,2
do you think hospitals in the city make most of their  money because of medicare/caide? because if so taking that away would force them to go to where people actually pay,10it35,2025-04-27T22:01:18,1
"No, the opposite in fact percentage wise a much lower percent of city hospital care is paid for via medicare and medicaid.  The one except being pregnancy but the vast majority of pregnancies for both rural and urban are subsidized.",redditlvlanalysis,2025-04-27T22:23:28,1
