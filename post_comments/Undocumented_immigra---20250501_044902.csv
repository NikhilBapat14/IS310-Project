Since they receive a whopping zero of social security it is not a hard calculus.,Geologue-666,2025-05-01T06:15:14,96
"When AOC was roasted for this, it showed how shockingly ignorant most people are as to how it works.  Anyone who's worked in a kitchen and had an honest conversation with back staff already knows that a SS number (even if obtained through gray-area means) is how employers are able to look the other way to the law.   They are getting taxes, SDI and SSI deducted just like everyone else.",chiree,2025-05-01T07:01:35,78
Sssh don’t spread those sort of facts to the maga morons.,jimmygee2,2025-05-01T05:05:10,26
"Like just about everything Trump says, his statements about immigrants are out and out lies. When someone spreads negative information about another group of human beings, they need to be called out. Such behavior is utterly evil and despicable.  Hitler adopted the same approach when talking about the Jews.  Trump needs to be driven from office as soon as possible before he embarks on his own holocaust, in the process destroying America and all it stands for.",crazybones,2025-05-01T06:05:35,21

How can they receive anything in benefits? They don't have socials?,jameszenpaladin011-,2025-05-01T08:33:25,7

And people didn't know about this? Really?,New-Ask-4652,2025-05-01T11:11:27,2
"Try mentioning this to a Trump supporter. First they’ll deny it’s true, then they’ll say some shit like “well that’s doesn’t matter anyway they’re here illegally and should be punished for breaking the law.”  They can’t for one second understand that we get more from migrants than migrants get from us. Sure there are things we need to clean up with our immigration system but the tactics we’re applying right now are almost 100% racially motivated.",hmr0987,2025-05-01T11:53:53,2
So what their goal is to dissolve any and all support for Americans so they have their 1850’s slave labor force. This is capitalism rapped in a fuzzy blanket of Christian nationalism.,Complete-Breakfast90,2025-05-01T12:10:07,2

Well duh!,Flat-Emergency4891,2025-05-01T11:19:36,1
Of course they do. Literally all have to pay in if using any SSN at any business with payroll. None of them can retire and receive SSA benefits. It has always been that way…,Albione2Click,2025-05-01T23:29:57,1
"How are they ""undocumented "" if they’re being tracked through Social Security? Lol",Good-Confusion-5118,2025-05-01T06:16:58,1
"Well maybe instead of engaging in identity theft they should get a legal SSN then, or crack down on the employers who are looking the other way, or - and this is crazy talk I know - the band of useless twats called 'Congress' could set up a guest worker program and folks wouldn't have to go through this crap",SurroundTiny,2025-05-01T09:31:45,1

"Among those who work ""legitimate"" jobs, sure.  But housekeepers, tree trimmers, day workers, specialty construction crews, ""handymen"", swapmeeters, parking lot tamale sellers, and the like (or pretty much anyone who works for cash)?  Tell me another one. . .",allenahansen,2025-05-01T10:03:53,-5
I’ve always jokingly called this the real fraud at the SSD. That department is just taking in so many funds from undocumented immigrants that won’t see a dime of it.,pancakebatter01,2025-05-01T17:36:30,2
"Undocumented workers were also encouraged to file tax returns despite not fully benefiting from those systems. And many actually did, through ITIN numbers.     ...until Trump 2.0. The IRS just agreed to share taxpayer information with ICE, meaning nobody will ever do it again.",AlphaGoldblum,2025-05-01T10:37:37,26
"Yep, construction too. Had a few guys on my crew over the years who's paperwork said they were thirty or forty something and the kid doesn't look a day over 22. Employers are only obligated to get a SSN from their employee they don't care or want to know if it's legit.",Good-Gold-6515,2025-05-01T08:47:47,26
"I worked as a contractor at Chevron for many years. The office moving staff was primarily made up of undocumented immigrants. It was sort of an open secret and no one said shit because no one wanted these guys to lose their jobs. They were all super cool, nice, and great workers.  How this group worked is that they would load 3-4 guys up on the same SS# that was legit. So one dude who had a SS# would get friends/relatives a job and they'd all use the same SS#.  I always assumed the contractor company just made it look on payroll like they were paying 1 guy $60/hr while in reality they were paying 4 guys $15/hr.",kroakfrog,2025-05-01T12:23:24,9
I mean the problem is if they keep it up Social security will never go away!,no-body1717,2025-05-01T06:23:54,5

"They have acquired socials to work, thus they are paying into the same things as everyone else but since the social security numbers are not legit they don’t ever collect on it.",mortalmonger,2025-05-01T08:36:57,7
Agree. Racism is a big part of the Trump administration's modus operandi.,ChaskaChanhassen,2025-05-01T11:57:00,1
yup,ChaskaChanhassen,2025-05-01T12:35:41,2
Undocumented immigrants buy a social security number and matching name on the black market. Social Security administration can see when multiple income streams are going to the same SSN. Up until recently most people in the government were smart enough not to fumble this free money.,Good-Gold-6515,2025-05-01T08:49:08,11
No legal status equates to undocumented I'm guessing,FancyHelicopter6784,2025-05-01T07:53:38,3
"You think these people receive benefits? Or that they do not pay into the system through regressive or consumption-based taxes? Anyway you slice it, migrants bring more value than they consume, except for the billions of dollars being spent to murder them.",AQuietViolet,2025-05-01T11:49:20,3
"Good. American employers need to be hiring U.S. citizens and legal immigrants, not illegal immigrants.",copaceticlife,2025-05-02T00:17:48,1
"I ended up making the eVerify entries at a job (because I was the one who tracked labor costs against project costs including labor so somehow inherited payroll...) And TBH- I never met most of the employees. I just entered two forms of ID and pestered one of the field guys til I had two that would clear. I was as likely to recognize a lift or material order delivered directly to site... It wasn't even a matter of caring or not just that we were checking off boxes.  Whenever people were declined, someone would come whining to me that it was a better employee/someone that knew their trade. And 90% of the folks I dealt with were R so it was quite humorous they wanted only legal immigration til it came to them being able to get work accomplished.",Any_Will_86,2025-05-01T13:48:32,6
"You and your thousand cousins on this sub are being programmed to be pretty agreeable right now, but I assume this is a test run.",pervocracy,2025-05-01T05:48:51,11
"Occasionally that happens, but that is expensive, actually illegal, and dangerous. More commonly, undocumented workers file using applied-for ITINs. There would be no SSN to attach to benefits",AQuietViolet,2025-05-01T11:43:55,4
I guess I just assumed they all lived cash only lives.,jameszenpaladin011-,2025-05-01T12:06:31,1
The Cornerstone these days.,DeeperThoughts57,2025-05-01T15:45:29,1
"Consumption based taxes hardly *begin* to cover the many benefits of living here without paying state or federal taxes-- especially when living six to a doublewide or urban apartment.   Undocumented migrants without private means or taxpaying employers receive the benefits of free health care (in CA at least), schooling for their children, title and ownership protections, emergency services, roads and infrastructure, (allegedly) clean water, a (once)robust economy and judicial system, local representation, food banks, marketplaces, religious freedoms and institutions, and the blessings of liberty and comforts of community-- to name just a few.    I mean, those civic entitlements are ostensibly why people come here, neh?",allenahansen,2025-05-01T14:49:50,1
This is a funny comment that I have greatly appreciated.  Thank you for your funny comment fellow human person.,incide666,2025-05-01T06:02:44,3
"Huh, interesting.",mortalmonger,2025-05-01T20:41:12,1
"Nope!  Even without an ITIN, companies still pay them as “contractors”. So the company still gets to deduct the pay.   If they really wanted to end illegal immigration, they would just make it illegal to hire them. But not only is it legal to hire them.. it’s also tax deductible. Funny how that works, huh?",Present-Perception77,2025-05-01T12:52:23,3

"What’s really happening here is that instead of letting them work and send their money back to Mexico or support themselves, the government plans to put them in concentration camps. Companies will still get the labor. They will just pay the money to the prison instead to the people.  Nothing more.",Present-Perception77,2025-05-01T13:54:54,2
