I believe they told him that. Of course they did. If they told him the truth - **we're picking you because our candidate is hopeless and we don't want to damage anyone who might actually have a chance in 2028** - even Li'l Timmy would have balked,WhiskeyMikeFoxtrot,2025-04-30T18:54:39,228

I was left leaning up until last year. Harris and Walz were the final nail in that coffin.   The other nails were being on Reddit for the last 5+ years and seeing all the extremist comments and hostility. Hell even against their own if you don't agree with them 100%.   No room for nuance.,Diminished_Flame7780,2025-05-01T08:06:13,13
