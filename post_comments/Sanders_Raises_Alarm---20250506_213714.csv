"Chat's breakdown of the linked article:   Here’s a breakdown of where the corruption issues come in:  **Key Players and Their Financial Ties**  Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) introduced the bill.  The bill was drafted with input from Circle, a major stablecoin issuer (maker of USDC).  Circle’s CEO was given early access to the legislation.  Circle executives and lobbyists have donated tens of thousands of dollars to the bill’s co-sponsors (including Gillibrand and Lummis).  **Where Corruption Allegations Arise**  Regulatory Capture:  The bill appears to allow private companies (like Circle) significant influence over how they are regulated. This undermines impartial governance and could lead to self-serving rules for stablecoin issuers.  Campaign Contributions as Influence:  The senators behind the bill have received sizable political donations from Circle and its allies, raising concerns about a quid pro quo arrangement. Critics see this as an example of lawmakers being swayed by corporate money.  Exclusion of Public Interest Voices:  Critics, including Senator Bernie Sanders, argue that the legislation was shaped behind closed doors, with heavy input from industry and minimal consideration for consumer protection, financial transparency, or systemic risk.  Lax Oversight Provisions:  The bill allows for state-level charters and oversight of stablecoin issuers, which could make it easier for these companies to avoid stricter federal regulations—similar to how crypto banks previously exploited loopholes in Wyoming.  **Bernie Sanders’ Critique**  Sanders described the bill as an example of how “billionaires and corporations write the rules.” He expressed concern that it prioritizes profit over public good, putting the stability of the financial system at risk in order to benefit a handful of crypto players.",GiftToTheUniverse,2025-05-06T22:05:20,18
Why am I not surprised that the Grift keeps going on and on and on? Dear Leader getting rich off of the cult. Congress won't do much of anything to rein in this sort of stuff especially if the Congress Critters can get a taste of the action.,NewfieDawg,2025-05-07T12:15:58,1
