"I just checked their sub (*uugghh*) and most of the top comments on this subject over there actually seem be on the side of price transparency. Some because they don’t think the government should interfere in private businesses, some because they think it will help people make informed decisions to buy fewer imported products, some because they think if he really believes these tariffs are the right choice he should stand by them and allow transparency. Honestly, I think it’s a small win any time they don’t all just agree with him by default.   I’m more interested in how there’s not a *single* mention of his interview with the Atlantic that came out yesterday where he came off like rambling old fool.",CumulativeHazard,2025-04-29T12:25:11,6
