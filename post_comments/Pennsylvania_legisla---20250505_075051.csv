"Just do it, I dont like pot and dislike the smell but we grown ass adults so I voted to legalize here in Michigan when it came up as a ballot initiative    If an adult wants to smoke pot or grow their own thats their choice..and frankly aside from being what I think is more addictive than people believe its not particularly dangerous (as long as people dont get high and like drive) and its not any more dangerous or addictive than Alcohol so its none of my business, the tax revenue is nice too",blues111,2025-05-05T07:57:56,52
They have this debate every year. It will never get through the state Senate. There is no initiative process in Pennsylvania. It's not going to happen. ,FrostingLegal7117,2025-05-05T10:10:29,11

This is like the 20th time. Typically republicans will find some small part of the bill last minute and hold out on passing it. Even the ‘bi-partisan’ bills that Shapiro says he would sign,SamuelYosemite,2025-05-05T14:29:06,1

"there are 2 types of addiction. physical and psychological. alcohol, cigarettes,  and opiates have the physical addiction. weed can have the psychological addiction, but that is more of a personal thing. i used to smoke weed damn near every day for something like 3 years. i found out my wife was preggo, stopped that same day with no ill effects. done it a couple times since then, not a fan. took me nearly 15 years to stop smoking, and took my best friend dying from alcohol to make me stop drinking. those have a nice hard to overcome physical dependency. weed though, the addiction you get is to the experience and culture around it, not explicitly the chemical. make no mistake, i know people that cant function without weed, and hell, i would argue they are nicer and healthier on the stuff. i myself was a less angry person when i smoked.",Wizzle-Stick,2025-05-05T14:44:46,3

"https://www.britannica.com/story/why-is-marijuana-illegal-in-the-us   > The short answer is racism. At the turn of the 20th century, cannabis—as it was then commonly known in the United States—was a little-used drug among Americans. With the start of the Mexican Revolution in 1910, however, many Mexicans began moving to the United States, and they brought with them the tradition of smoking marihuana. Amid a growing fear of Mexican immigrants, hysterical claims about the drug began to circulate, such as allegations that it caused a “lust for blood.”   An example we still see today is with police shootings and the ""He had cannabis in his system"" excuses as if that makes someone dangerous etc.",xlvi_et_ii,2025-05-05T08:59:37,38

"It doesn’t make sense to make a substance legal or illegal based on the ability of certain tools to detect it.   Field sobriety tests are also more than sufficient for preventing DUI, and urine tests post-arrest can make a definitive determination either way.",tripping_on_phonics,2025-05-05T08:57:26,10
