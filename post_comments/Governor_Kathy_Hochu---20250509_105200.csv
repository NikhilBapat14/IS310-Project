Seems like its perpetrating a fraud against citizens.    Why does LJ even need a defense? She owes 450 million for fraud... just like what they charged Trump with. Case closed.,MeLlamoKilo,2025-05-09T11:25:54,132

Are you legally allowed to use public money for a private legal defense like that?,ObadiahtheSlim,2025-05-09T13:14:57,25

"*“Kathy Hochul and Albany Democrats have reached a new low in their corrupt, far-left agenda by sneaking language into the state budget that misuses hardworking New Yorkers’ tax dollars to bankroll Letitia James’ legal defense against serious allegations of mortgage fraud. This disgraceful slush fund epitomizes the cesspool of corruption in Albany, where Democrat elites prioritize protecting their own over the needs of New York families.*   *Letitia James, who illegally weaponized her office to pursue politically motivated witch hunts, now expects taxpayers to foot the bill for her alleged misconduct. Meanwhile, New Yorkers are crushed by skyrocketing crime, a mass exodus from our state, and a cost-of-living crisis fueled by Hochul’s failed policies. Instead of addressing these urgent issues, Albany Democrats are doubling down on shielding their corrupt allies.*  *This shameful abuse of public funds demands accountability. I call on Governor Hochul to immediately remove this provision from the budget and for an independent investigation into James’ alleged fraud. New Yorkers deserve transparency, not taxpayer-funded cover-ups. As a proud representative of Upstate New York, I will continue to fight against the corrupt one-party rule in Albany and stand up for the hardworking families who are fed up with this blatant betrayal of public trust.”*",barepixels,2025-05-09T11:23:09,10

"They put the phrase ""reasonable"" and they're trying to tie the prosecution as being against her as a public official, not a private citizen.   Boy, can you hear them twisting themselves into pretzels to say why its a bad idea to use the DOJ against perceived political rivals? Oh my God, could you imagine if President did that? What if they did it against their opponent while they were campaigning! That would be the end of Democracy right?",OliverMonster1,2025-05-10T06:55:06,1
