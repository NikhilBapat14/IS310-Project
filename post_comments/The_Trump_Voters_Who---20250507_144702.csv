"What reasonable people think is batshit madness, is exactly what his voters asked for -at least in the relm of bigotry and authoritarian policies. These people really do want to see their hate become real action, and they'd love to lick some boots as well.",sesriously,2025-05-07T14:50:50,22

"Action for action's sake. One of the primary characteristics of fascism. It's one of those basic inversions of logic and morality you get when everything you do, say and think is in bad faith.  Having others experience the consequence of your actions is a form of power, so a leader who does things (even if it's destroying everything) is seen as powerful, and by extension they see themselves as powerful for identifying with him.  Specifically, they love action without reflection, without thinking or knowledge. As such this is connected to anti-intellectualism, a disdain for moral constraints and a rejection of deliberation (i.e. democracy), which are seen as weaknesses.  The moral aspect is even more obvious, namely fact that doing harm only makes him more popular, because what purer form of power is there than to harm others without recourse or consequences?  He embodies his supporters and they identify with him. By giving him the power to destroy, they see themselves as having that power, and because power and status are the same thing to an authoritarian, this lifts them above the out-group in the social hierarchy they want to establish or reinforce. Make no mistake here, unless they are stopped, these people will go further and further until it ends up as large scale political violence and mass murder. They will not stop because the emotional catharsis of inflicting harm on others is only a temporary substitute for actual material improvement. They can not stop, because once they think or reflect on their own actions the entire heroic narrative they have constructed falls apart and they are suddenly people who made choices and have to bear the moral responsibility for the consequences of those choices. They will never do that. If you let them, they will sacrifice everything and anyone to keep the narrative going.",barryvm,2025-05-07T14:55:05,7
