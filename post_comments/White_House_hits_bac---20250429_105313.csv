"When you break it down, it's kind of funny and just as stupid as you would expect when it comes to a story regarding this administration   ¬†The White House is mad at Amazon for something they didn't even get around to implementing and still managed to scream about Biden",AssociateGreat2350,2025-04-29T10:55:55,16

The largest source of imported clothing is China, followed by Vietnam and Bangladesh.""  Looks like the used clothing market is going to be on fire.",williamgman,2025-04-29T10:57:26,4
"As an Amazon customer, I would welcome the transparency that this would bring to Amazon's platform for the cost of the goods they sell.  I am sure it will make lives easier for sellers too as they won't have to explain so much the price of their product.  This is just Amazon protecting their relationship with their customers.  That said, Amazon only announced that:   > it had looked into itemising the costs for customers using Amazon Haul, a low-cost site it launched in the US last year to compete with Shein and Temu.  > But it denied such a move had been under consideration for its primary e-commerce platform.  Trump is overreacting without all the data per usual.",jcouball,2025-04-29T11:04:55,3

">But it denied such a move had been under consideration for its primary e-commerce platform.  > Still, the White House decision to go on the attack over the report is an indication of the pressure it is facing over its new import taxes, which analysts say will lead to higher prices for consumers and increase the chances of a recession. >  > At a press conference marking the president's 100 days in office, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said she had discussed Amazon's reported move with the president and claimed it represented ""another reason why Americans should buy American"". >  > ""This is a hostile and political act by Amazon,"" she said. ""Why didn't Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years?"" >  > Trump has ramped up tariffs since re-entering office in January, measures he argues will boost manufacturing and raise tax revenue for the US.    Holy shit - they/he doesn't understand the difference between inflation (and price gouging) versus tariff costs?  I know the man is dumb, but c'mon, man!  I do recall seeing line items for tariffs back around 2017 on aluminum or steel.  I even saw some older invoies from UPS with a shipping tariff to China from the Obama era.

"But trump pitched it as every additional dollar that's siphoned out of your pocket is for the betterment of the economy, so they should want this feature, right? Amazon showing the added cost would just be a helpful tool to let you know just how much you're patriotically donating to the American Liberation Fund^(‚Ñ¢). Don't you want to contribute your freedom dollars to trump's vision? It's just short term pain after all.

"From the press release:  > ""Amazon continues with its blatant weaponization of government.  They unethically use their power and influence to harass decent, hard-working executive branch officials.  This tariff information is confidential for a reason; it shields Republicans from retaliation by woke DEI whiners.""",insuproble,2025-04-29T11:05:03,1
Amazon never had any intention of publishing anything. They did this because they can now say ‚Äúthese price increases are not attributable to us‚Äù. All they need to do is get a story like this out there to soften upcoming sticker shock.,patm718,2025-04-29T11:06:34,4

"I work in the ecomm industry and a lot of places are actually doing this, even though it's a pain in the ass to implement.  No one *ever* shows details about a product's costs, so this is fairly unprecedented.  Websites and orgs don't even have the code to present this information because it's all hidden from front end systems behind ERPs and the like.      What's funny is that everyone's pretending super hard that all this work isn't basically a political protest as much as it's a PR move.  ""The rest of the industry is implementing tariffs this way, so we're doing that, too.  It's a hassle, but it's 'industry-standard' so what can we do?""     Everyone's acting like showing the portion of the price caused by the tariff is just basic SOX compliance or something, despite the fact that tariffs in general are not new and no one has ever done this before, *and* no one has ever asked them to do it.   The opposite in fact, the WH has been asking everyone to stop and the online retail industry is just ignoring them ü§£",IJustLoggedInToSay-,2025-04-29T12:05:15,1
