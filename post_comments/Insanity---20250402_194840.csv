He‚Äôs just flailing madly and flinging his poo in every possible direction at this point. Why is everything so awful? üò¢,abstrakt42,2025-04-02T20:45:54,73

Is trump the modern American Caligula?,Yamipervert,2025-04-03T01:12:23,11
Diego Garcia is also on the list. That's an island that is literally a US military base and nothing else,h1a4_c0wb0y,2025-04-03T10:46:09,9
Mentally unstable!,Butterflyteal61,2025-04-03T07:36:42,5
I can only imagine the mixture of White House staff being either horrified and terrified to tell Trump he is crazy or brainwashed and convinced it‚Äôs a good idea,Friendly_Engineer_,2025-04-03T08:49:33,6
What‚Äôs the tariff on Russia ?,mattyblu77,2025-04-03T13:31:11,6

So incompetent. This orange draft dodging criminal moron doesn't have a clue!!,Gold_Psychology2357,2025-04-03T12:34:02,3
Laura Loomer was in the White House today with a list of people to fire for not being sufficiently loyal to the orange idiot,Shopfiend,2025-04-03T15:11:08,3
Listen I hate Trump as much as the next guy but he said ‚Äúa gentleman today on television used to work with Lee Iacocca‚Äù but of course he slurred some words so it sounded weird. Announcing tariffs on an uninhabited island is some good shit though.,the_trump,2025-04-02T21:58:27,8

Where is this? Just saw another post with the list and none of these names are on it.,Intelligent_Burro,2025-04-03T08:15:58,3
The Trump tariff rates:  * EU - 20% * UK - 10% * Ukraine - 10% * Russia - none * Belarus - none,I405CA,2025-04-03T15:42:52,1

"And the sheep will find some way to execute the mental gymnastics necessary for this to make sense in their reality. Well, it's either that or they're gleefully giggling to themselves as the world economy crumbles. Either way, the poorest states and their brain dead residents are going to suffer the most, all while blaming Dems, the LBGTQ+ Community and brown people.  Those ""Donald Trumpery PLEASE SAVE US"" eviction videos are gonna be EPIC!!!",Hyperactiv3Sloth,2025-04-03T19:42:32,1

"Perhaps Mr Booker could have added that Trump can be removed due to the mental instability he is exhibiting. You know - just to plant the seed ( idea), in the minds to those few who have that power.  ( oh, I can dream a little )",Alternative_Gate4158,2025-04-04T02:45:43,1
"Democrats, you're really making yourselves look good. You've got one person posting unverified info (which happens to be false LMAO) and a bunch of sheep that automatically believe it without doing ANY research of their own.   I can't wait for the day when liberals pull their shit together and start actually using their brains. Oh wait, that's probably never going to happen.",CatMilk0111111111111,2025-04-03T09:50:55,-19

Because you're dealing with a narcissist.   That's how they react to sickness and death.   They literally think that's something that happens to other people,Think-Secretary6604,2025-04-03T09:20:19,24

Technically Diego Garcia is owned by Great Britain.,Labaholic55,2025-04-03T15:12:05,2
There are no TARRIFFS on russia,Shopfiend,2025-04-03T15:11:59,5
"It's nowhere. These people are insane and will make up (and believe) whatever they can as long as it makes Trump look bad. A quick Google search will show you that he never claimed to talk to Lee Iacocca. It will also tell you that the ""completely uninhabited"" islands have produced up to $325,000 in taxes in the last 5 years.",CatMilk0111111111111,2025-04-03T09:42:42,-12

I lied. NPR just verified this post. Turns out I was wrong. Can you say the same?,Intelligent_Burro,2025-04-03T15:13:57,3
Yes it is owned by Great Britain but it is home to a joint US UK naval base and has no civilian population,h1a4_c0wb0y,2025-04-03T15:13:20,1
He's just a trolling stooge. His profile is all over the map posting dumb shit. Ideal Trump voter.,Amazing_Bluejay9322,2025-04-03T17:46:59,2
Was just wondering if that was the reason for the tariff?,Labaholic55,2025-04-03T15:26:41,2
How naive of you to assume there is a reason behind any of this? Reason requires intelligence. This administration lacks any of that,h1a4_c0wb0y,2025-04-03T15:27:21,1
