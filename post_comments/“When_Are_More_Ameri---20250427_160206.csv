His generation and Millennials have failed to step up ? The older people in Congress have held on to power so tightly with their boney fingers that we couldn‚Äôt pry it out of their hands.

Agree. Democrats need to be fighting in congress. They are letting republicans in congress strip them of power. Every day they should be screaming and fighting back. Do not make this about Trump.   Make this about their counterparts and coworkers. Republicans are allowing democracy to die on their watch. Make it loud and make it clear. Make America know. Make Republicans know that this will be the hill they die on and let them make that choice.   Right now Republicans are being given a free pass. To sit back keeping their hands clean and deflecting on Trump while they enrich themselves by looting our democracy. Make it a choice. Make them get covered in the mud.   Make it about them and not Trump. Trump is only allowed to do this because congress is completely complicit. At least make him accountable to congress and at least then if he chooses to not be then there is no hiding the fascism behind the guise of democracy. Democrats have to put it out in the open and that starts with congress - as a whole branch of government - pushing back.,lnin0,2025-04-27T20:47:11,2
