"“And so as much as we want to point a finger at people who are elected to positions, which is justified, I also want to ask a lot of other powerful people in this country who are remaining silent. We’ve seen what many corporate leaders are doing right now—instead of speaking up and speaking truth, they’re kowtowing for their own private deals.”  This really is a super important point Booker makes here. In a world where money talks, elected Dem leadership can only do so much when corporate leaders are racing to kiss the ring and profit.

His generation and Millennials have failed to step up ? The older people in Congress have held on to power so tightly with their boney fingers that we couldn’t pry it out of their hands. They refused to let younger people onto committees. Last month they voted an 80 year old with cancer in over AOC because the idea of letting anyone with new ideas have even a shred of power was beyond comprehension. They will not step aside and let their seats go.  Now we have a room full of sycophants and old folks that either can’t or won’t do anything.,Cryinmyeyesout,2025-04-27T21:40:33,4

Agree. Democrats need to be fighting in congress. They are letting republicans in congress strip them of power. Every day they should be screaming and fighting back. Do not make this about Trump.   Make this about their counterparts and coworkers. Republicans are allowing democracy to die on their watch. Make it loud and make it clear. Make America know. Make Republicans know that this will be the hill they die on and let them make that choice.   Right now Republicans are being given a free pass. To sit back keeping their hands clean and deflecting on Trump while they enrich themselves by looting our democracy. Make it a choice. Make them get covered in the mud.   Make it about them and not Trump. Trump is only allowed to do this because congress is completely complicit. At least make him accountable to congress and at least then if he chooses to not be then there is no hiding the fascism behind the guise of democracy. Democrats have to put it out in the open and that starts with congress - as a whole branch of government - pushing back.,lnin0,2025-04-27T20:47:11,2

You honestly think you can coast for another 18 months until the midterms? You haven't got time for that.

It is just an informal rule though, the speaker can basically do whatever they want because of the Conditional aspect. They can refuse to put a vote up for any reason, but if they do so in opposition to the majority of their own party it means they might not stay speaker.
