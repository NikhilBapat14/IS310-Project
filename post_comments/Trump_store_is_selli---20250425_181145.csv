An encouraging amount of people on the conservative sub canâ€™t even justify this one haha,gangstasadvocate,2025-04-25T19:36:35,1
Yea until they run out of money or Chinese imports to bring hats to stores.,Ok-Excuse1771,2025-04-25T20:09:57,1
How about Trump 1789 hats? French revolution style.,NPVT,2025-04-25T20:23:15,1
The media needs to counter this bullshit with reports that Obama will run against him in 2028.,LucynSushi,2025-04-25T20:26:31,1
Can you imagine an idiot wearing one while they stand in line at the food bank?,invalidpassword,2025-04-26T05:09:08,1
he has literally just been president for only 3 months why is he already thinking about this? for what reason would he need to be even talking about this i dont get it.,Long-Ad3842,2025-04-26T06:16:39,1
Would be fun to open a Obama â€™28 store right next to the Trump store,Space_Sweetness,2025-04-26T19:12:36,1
finally a hat with an expiration date more delusional than the guy selling it,Crafty_Cheesecake404,2025-04-25T23:43:34,0
"Look, Trump is doing way worse things to get worked up over than wasting time overreacting to this nonsense. Just because this idiot is selling this doesn't mean he can legally run again.",NeoThorrus,2025-04-25T18:19:21,-2

"This has been investigated. A lot of the hats sold by official trump merch are made in, like, oregon or washington state. Water bottles and t-shirts, howeverâ€¦. I forgot who went into the store in Trump tower to find out.",Throwaway734640,2025-04-26T00:57:52,1

"He can illegally run again, which he is absolutely going to do.Â   How many times does Trump have to demonstrate that heâ€™s fucking insane before people start taking these threats to our constitution seriously?",epicredditdude1,2025-04-25T18:39:01,11
Don the Con has repeatedly proven he does not care about legalities.,ResidentKelpien,2025-04-25T18:40:20,4
The process of changing the rules has lwgal avenues.  Thats how we got the amendments that limit terms now.   He has a few years to drum up a movement to do that again.,vader_seven_,2025-04-26T12:18:38,1
"You didn't read what I said. He has done many illegal things, but selling a cap saying 2028 is not unlawful. The Constitution is very clear on this matter, and he has been losing on even less clear issues. Good luck with this one. Creating a panic for something that may or may not happen in 2028 is not helpful when the guy is doing things with more pressing matters. Moreover, if he were to run, he would have the problem that all swing states are run by Dems, and they would just remove him from the ballot because he is not eligible to be President anymore. In addition to all this, this guy has been in power for 100 days and already has a lower approval than this first term. And letâ€™s not include that he will be 85 years old by then. If you still believe that all this will somehow wont matter, then what is the recourse? Panicking now wont help win the midterm and won convince any independents to vote against him. That is my point.",NeoThorrus,2025-04-25T18:57:56,2

Trump can run as VP and can legally become President when 48 (Vance?)  resigns on day one .,pezdal,2025-04-25T19:37:58,-1
"12th Amendment says ""no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of president shall be eligible to that of vice-president of the United States"".",NeoThorrus,2025-04-25T19:44:31,5
"The argument would be that Trump was/is eligible to the office of president, just not eligible to run for it.  Or he becomes Speaker of the House and sneaks in that way??  His threats need to be taken seriously.  However we canâ€™t let them distract from the other bat-shit crazy stuff.",pezdal,2025-04-25T19:48:02,1
"I don't think that is a strong argument. Especially when the intention of Congress was very clear when the amendment was written. But again, that might happen in 4 years. Panicking now is not helpful.",NeoThorrus,2025-04-25T19:56:04,1
Agreed on not panicking.  When liberal Supreme Court justices start dying mysteriously only to be replaced by Trump croniesâ€¦ then can I start panicking?,pezdal,2025-04-25T20:01:01,2
