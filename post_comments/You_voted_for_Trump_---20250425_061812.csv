"College is expensive, those loans should be taken out with a clear goal in mind and research done about career aspects post-degree and a plan to pay off loans with that new career.  That being said, I still think it's bullshit that universities continue to inflate their prices since they know you can't escape them with bankruptcy and that lenders have no problem approve 80k loans for dumbass degrees they know borrowers wont be able to pay off.",adoboseasonin,2025-04-25T06:38:06,1630

"Well first hold universities at fault for knowingly offering degrees that have no real ability to pay off the debt. Next remove all non-constitutional funding from the table. That includes Pell grant and Federal subsidizing of student loans and debt. Restore the laws that forbid publicly funded universities from surrendering their part of a patent to private companies. That will increase funding. Next restore the programs that legally aided degree programs via county, state, or national service.  That should solve a large part of it. Also remove all DEI and Pro-WASP education formats from the universities.

"If at any point they switched to an income-driven repayment plan (like IBR, PAYE, REPAYE, etc.) or extended the loan to lower their monthly payments, it would stretch repayment out over decades.  These plans can cause negative amortization, where interest accumulates faster than you’re paying it off… meaning the balance can grow even while you’re making payments.  Even without weird plans, a standard 30-year loan at 7% interest for $50,000 would mean paying about $1,000 per month for 30 years, totaling $360,000 over the life of the loan.  Paying $225,000 over 19 years (since 2006) and still owing close to $50,000 is entirely plausible under those conditions.  Add interest capitalization to the mess, and after almost 20 years and $225,000 paid, it’s very normal for the balance to still be close to the original $50,000.",thewholetruthis,2025-04-27T00:10:27,22

To top it off they run a small farm stand that does pretty well. He is all self taught and one of the smartest guys I know. He is a problem solver.

">If at any point they switched to an income-driven repayment plan (like IBR, PAYE, REPAYE, etc.) or extended the loan to lower their monthly payments, it would stretch repayment out over decades.  On a $50k loan, that would mean paying about $100 monthly, not $940.   >These plans can cause negative amortization, where interest accumulates faster than you’re paying it off…  This is just called making bad life choices. If youre making basic stupid financial decisions like this, I'd question the point of even going to college. This is even dumber than an E2 taking their signing on bonus to buy a Mustang.   The taxpayer doesn't need to be bailing you out because you were dumber than a box of rocks, especially when you were supposedly borrowing to ""get an education"" in the first place.   >Even without weird plans, a standard 30-year loan at 7% interest for $50,000 would mean paying about $1,000 per month for 30 years, totaling $360,000 over the life of the loan.   No, that just isn't true at all. Try it with a loan calculator. Monthly repayment works out to $333. 333 × 30 × 12 works out to be $120k which is much higher than what you borrowed but not insanely so, and that's what compounding interest does.",funny_flamethrower,2025-04-27T01:53:19,4

But it could still be mandatory in public school and not required at the college level unless it actually relates to the degree field.

"MEDIAN college DEBT is under 25k. This means at least half of all college graduates have less than 25K in debt upon graduation. And as far as your costs, that's way off. I'm in a state school and my tuition costs for a year are 6k for an in state student, less than 7.8K for an online student anywhere, and 17.5K for an out-of-state student on campus. So for an state resident, that's a degree for under 25k. It's an online degree for around 30k. College isn't that expensive if you aren't stupid about it.",JustinCayce,2025-04-25T21:10:28,-2

"> Government loans can be extremely helpful.  Yes, loans are extremely helpful. However, I don't want the government using my taxes for loans. In an imaginary society where they can demonstrate a profitable loan structure that reduces my tax burden, then there may be some room for loans. But the reason governments give out loans is because private loans expect the loan to be repaid and not lose money. If your government loans are simply incentives that private loans would never offer, then just hand out cash and skip the overhead.",BarrelStrawberry,2025-04-25T07:58:48,1
