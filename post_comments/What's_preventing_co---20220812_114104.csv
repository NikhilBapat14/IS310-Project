"Nothing, physically. Which is also a theme I think you'll come to notice quite a lot once you start looking into political relationships. Both international and domestic. Most groups and nations can do a lot of things. However, the big but here is that other people can have a reaction to the thing that the first group/nation did.  In this case, yes, China could physically ship train load after train load of tanks into Russia. Physically, China could send an army into Ukraine via Russia and invade the nation alongside Russia. No one could stop that directly.  But the world can and would respond. China is attempting to become a super power. To do that, it needs soft power even more than hard power. The world's nation's will largely recoil if China becomes more actively involved on the side of Russia. Chinese economic deals will be canceled. Opinions of China will plummet. Cultural ties will be severed. Chinese soft power will be smacked around pretty badly, just as it's being built up.   Then they also risk a more targeted response. Western sanctions could stab a deep hole into the Chinese economy. Their finance system in particular was build to join the western system, so the quick and brutal removal of the Chinese finance system from the broader world it was designed for would be very bad for it.   And so far, China hasn't been willing to provoke these reactions.   You can do a lot of things physically. But then so can other people.",omgwouldyou,2022-08-13T19:05:37,2
