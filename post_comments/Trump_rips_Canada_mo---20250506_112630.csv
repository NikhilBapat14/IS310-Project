"There’s a lot of things we don’t need from them but USA Hockey *does* rely on Canadian made equipment. Considering how expensive the stuff already is, I’d prefer they get exempt.",Shiny_Mew76,2025-05-06T13:22:24,-36

Ya the hockey equipment is outrageous hopefully it’s exempt.,OutlandishnessMain56,2025-05-06T15:35:52,0
"You do realize there are lots of small businesses who have to import that equipment to sell it, right? There’s only one American made hockey brand for what I’m aware of, Warrior.   I have a local shop up the road who sells the stuff. Especially down further south you don’t find that stuff at the big retail chains. They can take on the costs, small businesses cannot, especially when stuff isn’t made in the United States at all.  Work on moving factories back over here, sure, I support that 100%, but for items and services that do not exist or not in a large capacity in this economy, you aren’t even protecting a domestic industry because that industry doesn’t exist.",Shiny_Mew76,2025-05-06T15:51:30,0
