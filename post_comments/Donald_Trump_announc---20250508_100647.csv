"So UK people - how you feel about your boy Starmer now? I had to turn off the press conference - it's bad enough when his people do it, but to see a foreign leader not just bending the knee, but bending over completely was pretty disgusting",guh_mystocks,2025-05-08T10:13:59,5

"I don't know the value of the US exports of ethanol.... but this deal as outline in the FT article sounds like a big win for the UK... some 'art of the deal'     Both the US president and the UK‚Äôs prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer, talked up the pact as a landmark in the countries‚Äô relations but it stops short of a comprehensive agreement.  * The UK will be able to export 100,000 cars a year to the US at a 10 per cent tariff, a reduction on the prevailing 27.5 per cent tariff. That quota is big enough to account for almost all current exports. * Tariffs on steel and aluminium fall from 25 per cent to zero. * A 10 per cent tariff that applies to most goods imports remains. * The two countries have agreed ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù market access on beef, with UK farmers receiving a tariff-free quota of 13,000 metric tonnes and Starmer insisting there will be no change to food safety standards. * The UK will remove the tariff on US ethanol.",Dapper-Condition6041,2025-05-08T11:56:36,1

Everyone in power in the UK knows Trump is an idiot. Many have said so when he wasnt President. Playing nice is just politics because Trump loves his ego stroked and it gets the UK what it wants,bobblebob100,2025-05-08T10:22:16,7
"If keeping the orange idiot happy protects jobs at JLR and Rolls Royce, then Starmer‚Äôs doing his job well.",GrapeGroundbreaking1,2025-05-08T10:18:40,3
"We'll have to wait and see the small print I think, the agricultural side of things is concerning but if we aren't compromising our food standards to reach that deal and aren't undercutting our own farmers I think it'll be ok.   Rolls Royce engines being tariff free could be significant, especially if they can land some defence contracts (they're already working with BAE on 6th Gen fighter jets)  Steel could be big as well given we've just started the process of nationalising British Steel, so we were in need of a big win here.  On the flip side, if we're getting bad quality agricultural products and US companies start to undercut our domestic markets then it's a nightmare.  In terms of Starmer fellating Trump, yeah a difficult watch but he did that last time they met and it helped us avoid higher tariffs so if it works then I'll get over it.",CatPanda5,2025-05-08T10:24:24,3
"Grateful we have a grown up that is willing to swallow his own personal distates to try boost the country's economy.  Some of my fellow MAGA-lite countrymen think the bootlicking-toad Farrage would be better for us.

His likability has went way up actually. People know Trump is a wean and needs praised and made to feel special. People like having an adult in the room who is able to manipulate him.,did_ye,2025-05-08T10:54:52,2
"It's weird. I despise Trump. I am currently trying to avoid buying as many US products as I can (sorry guys - I know you didn't all vote for this, we had the same issue with Brexit).¬†  However, I think it is good for some of our key industries and business like Rolls Royce and Jaguar Land rover. We as a country are in a very weird position where Trump seems to like us and considers us 'allies' whilst we still are building ties with Europe and trying to assist with Ukraine, so I think we are trying to make the best out of a relatively shit situation which some European nations will struggle to do just simply due to geopolitics at the moment.

"> how you feel about your boy Starmer now?  After all his corruption scandals, disability welfare cuts, anti-LGBT bigotry, unwavering support for the Netanyahu regime, scapegoating of immigrants, efforts to kick anyone vaguely left-leaning out of his party, refusing to do anything about the HS2 nonsense\*, and massive recent election losses to the far right... doing a silly PR stunt with his bff doesn't really change my opinion of him. At least they don't seem to be starting a huge war like the last time a ""centrist"" Labour prime minister developed a surprisingly close relationship with a far-right American president who had a severely limited understanding of the world.  \*The last government repeatedly slashed Britain's planned new high-speed rail network so that it will now consist of a single line that connects one station in the London suburbs to two stations in Birmingham, stopping just short of a huge bottleneck that was the biggest original motivation for the project.",hloba,2025-05-08T10:42:53,0
"I am very disappointed in Keir Starmer generally tbh, I would say he is kinda heartless, not as in a total sociopath or anything, but for eg he approaches people who are too sick and disabled to work in the UK in a totally callous way, even worse than the Tory party - and he \*did not\* have to do that - and the same sort of lack of what gives someone a kind of passionate morality, if that makes sense, is how I see what made him refuse to actually stand up to Trump. The UK was due to lose around 0.7% of our GDP (apparently) due to Trump's proposed tariffs - most of which remain (!) so we haven't really avoided that, and the goods excepted aren't even goods we export much of to the US or are in any surplus in regard to, whereas the US is getting to trade without tariffs - so it is certainly not fair and the US are the winners re the deal for sure.  So, you are aboslutely right, Starmer bowed down, and he did not have to, and while it's correct that it doesn't mean we can't have trade deals with anyone else, for the pittance this US agreement means, he could have stood stronger and shown more solidarity to especially the EU and Canada etc, in being clear that the world will not bow down to US bullying or in any way legitimise a President acting despicably. That, to me, would be much better leadership. I understand no-one wants a trade war, but I also don't believe the answer is just to get whipped.
