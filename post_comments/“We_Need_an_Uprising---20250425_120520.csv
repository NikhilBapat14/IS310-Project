How is this not an arrestable offense. Inciting a riot they tried to put Trump away for a vague comment but this one is absolutely clear. I don’t get it.,Illustrious_Mind_979,2025-04-25T13:19:18,10

They tried to say that he was guilty of insurrection and ineligible to hold federal office! But prominent Democrat politicians calling for actual uprising is somehow acceptable...,Mountain_Man_88,2025-04-25T16:18:40,19

They'll just claim it's hyperbole since there's no way a leftist can drag themselves up the basement stairs to take action beyond banging on a keyboard.,KevtheKnife,2025-04-25T12:47:06,15
