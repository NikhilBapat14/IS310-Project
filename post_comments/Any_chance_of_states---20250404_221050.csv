"Trump is directly targeting blue states. Taking away grants, social security benefits, fema aid, etc   All while his economic policies are destroying the national economy.   I wouldn’t say it’s likely but Trumps actions are stoking a sectional conflict.",CombinationLivid8284,2025-04-05T09:21:41,16
Turning domestic tourism into international tourism via secession seems like it would only add to their economic woes.,Mrgoodtrips64,2025-04-05T09:16:04,12
"Literally 0. I do think we will see blue states ""break away"" in terms of trade deals and talking with foreign countries, like we're seeing with California. New York, Illinois, Minnesota, etc... will probably follow. Or at least they should.",AmericanUnityParty1,2025-04-05T09:50:52,4
"Nope, none, zero, nada. The Supreme Court has always been explicit about states cannot secede and I doubt any justice would ever agree to this, ever. Statehood is perpetuity until the day the republic collapses fully and letting one state out essentially means you justify the Confederacy coming back and countries tend to not want to recognize separatist states because every single major state has separatist groups in their own countries as well.",Comfortable_Day_411,2025-04-05T02:51:08,10
"California is working on it's own trade deals to end-run Trump's stupidity and protect themselves, but that's as far as it will go.  As much as the people of the internet love to talk about secession it's not viable in today's world as interdependent and mixed as we all are geographically and there is no constitutional basis for it to begin with.  You have a pocket of dipshits in Texas, California, Oregon and Alaska that are the largest groups for such movements and they are mostly just posturing and noise to rattle the rabble motivated by such things.  My guess is the ones that want a national divorce and civil war share one thing in common... in their fantasies about it, they are all the main character and will come out on top or it and they likely mistake inconvenience for hardship and think themselves a lot harder than they actually are.",Za_Lords_Guard,2025-04-05T09:23:48,2
I believe USA settled the dispute of whether states may voluntarily secede or not in a rather famous civil war.,Intro-Nimbus,2025-04-05T09:23:16,3
"Secession takes a lot.  Have to set up your own government, own military, own currency, etc etc.  Not going to happen.  The US military is in Hawaii.  What they going to do kick out the US military forces?",SlowFreddy,2025-04-05T09:46:54,1
"Texas v White effectively ruled that secession is unconstitutional.    There is no clear legal path to lawfully leaving the union but it is clear that a unilateral declaration of independence is not legally binding.  As far as the Supreme Court was concerned, there was never a Confederate States of America, just an illegal rebellion that was put down.  States could attempt to secede, but it would be at the risk of waging a war or suffering other penalties without their secession being recognized.  A state referendum voting for it might send a message to Washington and that message might be useful politically.  But it would have no legal effect.",I405CA,2025-04-05T11:30:28,1
"I'm not a Gavin Newsome fan, but California trading on its own is pretty interesting.",OkraLegitimate1356,2025-04-05T22:41:39,1
"If Trump starts a war with Canada I could see several states fighting against US military presence. If Trump then increases military presence against the wishes of northern states, I could see a scenario where Northern states leave the US but most likely to join Canada instead of start their own country.",Matt2_ASC,2025-04-07T19:06:04,1
"California is setting up to go for it alone if something goes bad enough.  Trump hasn't invested money into fixing California after the fires.  And California is starting to set up trade deals with other countries   [https://www.newsweek.com/california-newsom-trade-trump-tariffs-2055414](https://www.newsweek.com/california-newsom-trade-trump-tariffs-2055414)  Also California has the ability to have an army.   [https://www.governing.com/archive/military-civilian-active-duty-employee-workforce-numbers-by-state.html](https://www.governing.com/archive/military-civilian-active-duty-employee-workforce-numbers-by-state.html)  And worse yet and scariest thing about Californa is that in Los Angeles can Immediately re-setup manufacturing for weapons like in world war II, and Berkley College (the ""hippy"" one) is the Place where the Nuclear Bomb was started.  And it isn't hard to see Washington, and Oregon also joining an alliance and pretty much becoming western cultures tech centure  So California the state, could easily become this west coast country with tons of Geo-political importance due to the closeness of Japan, China, and Russia. But how that country will react without the restraints of the smaller states, Flyover, Midwest,Southern, Appalachia, Welfare states in the USA, is a big question.  But also Texas, Florida, and New York, would not want to waste their money to build roads in Mississippi or Michigan, the whole of the united states would fall apart,",ComprehensiveHold382,2025-04-11T12:55:21,1

"I’ve wanted national divorce for years and now that it’s finally on the table, I’m mildly surprised that it’s the left wanting to leave.

"It would 100% hurt. Worth noting IMO that roughly 20% of tourism is already international, but putting themselves in the middle of massive political uncertainty would obviously tank that as well. I’m viewing this in termed of a COL lense",Maustin_99,2025-04-05T09:40:34,1
"100% agree that there would be massive efforts from the federal government to prevent it, but in terms of just pushing Hawaii towards taking that step themselves, I don’t believe it’s far fetched. When they have their entire economy flipped upside down that is dependent on foreign imports, I just think there would be very little patience and that formal secession is the path of least resistance to fix, assuming they think the tariffs are here for good",Maustin_99,2025-04-05T09:21:48,1
"California’s attempt to negotiate independent trade deals is a pivoting point for sure and will fit sure increase hostility between them and the White House.  One argument though for Hawaii specifically would be that its interdependence in trade with SE Asia and tourism from there could in my eyes make formal secession more feasible, atleast more than other states. The most complicated aspect would be US’s massive military presence and would 100% retaliate against it. Playing devils advocate here for sure…",Maustin_99,2025-04-05T09:34:14,1
"We sure did! But countries slowly evolve every day along with the world. I’m not talking about the legality of it or not about success given the federal government would 100% try to shut it down, but just in terms of Hawaii or someone else formally attempting it, I have to believe there is heavy motivation there.",Maustin_99,2025-04-05T09:36:14,5

"Doubtful that would be a surefire way for California to wreck their economy. But if they did Republicans probably let them, taking almost a 5th of the EVs dems need to win the presidency off the table would guarantee wins in the presidential elections and a huge permanent rightward shift in politics.",Dr_thri11,2025-04-05T08:29:59,1

Why do you want a national divorce? What would it look like?,MoreMeLessU,2025-04-05T09:14:25,3
"It sure seems that given how much divided and hostile both parties have been towards each other, we have put ourselves as a country on that path… TBH though it has seemed like the sentiment has just been stronger in whichever party is not in power and said power in party will always accuse them of treason/starting a civil war DESPITE themselves acting similarly.

If Brexit has taught us anything it’s that leaving a larger somewhat stable union to go it alone has nothing but downsides economically.,Mrgoodtrips64,2025-04-05T13:27:40,1
"Yeah. Play all you want.  I have yet to see a good argument with a practical approach to secession.  Mostly, it's a pipe dream for people who think it would be easier than fixing what we broke or even agreeing on what needs fixed.  I appreciate the devil's advocate position. As a thought experiment, it's interesting... like play it forward.  How does trade work for an autonomous Hawaii? Would import costs spike? Could local businesses and agriculture provide enough locally for the population? How do they ensure independence? How so they even achieve it with a damn fleet parked in thir driveway?  A lot of systems would suddenly put under extreme duress, could a civilian democracy move quickly and flexibly enough to keep critical infrastructure and systems working in the transition or would am authoritarian take over to guild the transition?  Would they quit when things settle or become the new King/Queen of Hawaii? Do they then get deposed, and a new period of unrest starts? How many died during this process.  How many children are going hungary? Who's rights were trampled in the name of independence? How many children miss an education and will end up in menial jobs as business leaders, doctors, scientists, and teachers try to leave looking for a more stable country to call home.  Do I sound a bit over the top? Probably.  But if people don't think down all those dark rabbit holes of possibility, then they do not really understand the weight of what secession or civil war could cause.  Realistically, I expect pockets of militia violence akin to Iteland during ""the Troubles,"" and that isn't a pleasant future to ponder either, except it will be right-wing militias trying to disrupt blue cities and left wing protestors railing against the government (assuming Trump stays in power).  They won't be as openly violent, but there will be violent actors within those protests. Only went on in Ireland for 30 years, so I will be long dead before the sun shines on America again... if it ever does.",Za_Lords_Guard,2025-04-05T09:55:14,1
Maybe tune into reality. This is never happening and you seem delusional to think it goes past some blow hard posturing. This seems like something a foreign agent from China would suggest because it is exactly the type of opening they are looking for.,SylvanDsX,2025-04-08T17:44:19,2

If the economy is wrecked anyways then why not though. We sell crops internationally. We have a strong tourism industry. Tech companies will be kicked out by foreign countries.

You're really downplaying how reliant every state is on trading with the others. This would essentially make California an island and island economies are difficult.   Also the big elephant in the room with any secession is our political division isn't really red state vs blue state. It's blue cities vs red countryside.,Dr_thri11,2025-04-05T09:39:59,2

"Australia is extremely dependent on imports. But even they'll have more capacity for domestic production than California being less of an island than a continent.   Any state that goes independent is going to see a huge loss in standard of living. If you think the incoming tariffs are dumb economic suicide, it shouldn't be hard to see how creating trade barriers  within the country will end up being so much worse.  And yeah if CA tries to secede you would absolutely see the red  parts try to become Nevada or East CA rather than being drug into a new country they don't align with politically.",Dr_thri11,2025-04-05T10:26:56,2
