"Changes to a standing committee's membership are made by resolution. For example, [here is](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-resolution/14/text) the resolution to elect the chairs of the house committees for the 118th congress. These are usually passed by unanimous consent (without a vote), but if there was something controversial about it, someone could object and prevent it from passing.",kjfdlhs,2023-10-17T18:30:58,3
"the process starts with corporate giants disliking the current chairman, because they wont suck their corporate toe and bow down to their needs.  The corporate elite then give direction to their bots (members of the HOR) to vote them out. The bots listen and do so.  Chairman is now gone.   Thanks for coming to my ted talk.",TalentedThots,2023-10-29T19:14:52,0
