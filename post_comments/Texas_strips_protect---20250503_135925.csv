"For several years now, conservatives have been ramping up their efforts to ban and challenge thousands of book titles.   The content of the books themselves doesn't matter, in fact, most of these book banners haven't even read the titles they're challenging.  They're simply told that these titles are promoting ""radical gender ideology,"" or they're ""pornographic,"" or they're pushing ""DEI,"" ""wokeness,"" and ""anti-white discrimination.""  Organized groups publish lists on social media of hundreds of book titles, and then conservatives show up en masse to libraries, or to school board and town meetings, where they air out their grievances in public and take steps to remove these books from shelves.  These highly organized groups work to do things like establish events where people fill out forms provided to them that allow them to challenge these hundreds of titles.  When people at these events are asked if they've read the books they're challenging, most of them answer no.  They are told explicitly that every book listed is inappropriate for their children and become convinced that there is some pervasive, radical leftist plot to indoctrinate their children with gender ideology and white guilt while exposing them to graphic pornography.  Even state and federal lawmakers are writing bills like House Bill 8 in Ohio, which they've described as a “Parents' Bill of Rights,” requiring K-12 school officials to notify parents if their child is exposed to sexually explicit instructional content or if the student asks teachers to identify them by a different gender.  A law of the same name was passed by Republicans in the house in 2023...  The bill withholds federal funding to any schools who don't give parents/legal guardians the right to access and review school curricula, and to ""inspect the books and other reading materials in the library of their child's school."" Also, schools up to eighth grade must obtain parental consent before changing a child's pronouns or allowing gender-based accommodations.  The ALA said that these efforts:  > ironically would lead to more government interference in family decisions regarding voluntary reading,"" including creating ""a catalyst for more book banning and censorship.  Democrats tried to amend the bill and Republicans unanimously shot it down. The amendment would have added language to the bill that would have prevented the:  > banning or censorship of books in public elementary or public secondary schools.  The language specifically cited the Holocaust, Black history, LGBTQ+ topics, and Native American history as being protected if the amendment passed.  Now, according to data, there has been a rising trend in both parents and politicians pushing for these book bans.  Republicans claim that these books are rife with pornography and radical gender ideology.  These same Republicans have also granted themselves the authority to dictate what falls under the purview of these terms, deliberately using vague language both in and outside of legislation to push their agendas.  According to data from the ALA, challenges to unique titles went up nearly 40 percent in 2022, and 2,571 unique titles were challenged or banned in that same year.  Over a one year period, 40 percent of the *banned* titles had protagonists or prominent secondary characters of color, and 21% had titles with issues of race or racism, according to PEN America, a non-profit tracking book ban data.  Another 41 percent of titles challenged or banned have content relating to LGBT identity and themes, according to PEN.  According to the ALA, the book, *Gender Queer* was at the top of the list of the most challenged books that year.  > The graphic memoir follows Kobabe's path to gender-identity as nonbinary and queer. Most of the books on the list have been challenged with claims of including LGBTQIA+ or sexually explicit content.  Here is the list of the top ten challenged or banned books for those interested:  1. *Gender Queer* by Maia Kobabe 2. *All Boys Aren't Blue* by George M. Johnson 3. *The Bluest Eye* by Toni Morrison 4. *Flamer* by Mike Curato  5. *Looking for Alaska* by John Green 6. *The Perks of Being a Wallflower* by Stephen Chbosky 7. *Lawn Boy* by Jonathan Evison 8. *The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian* by Sherman Alexie  9. *Me and Earl and the Dying Girl* by Jesse Andrews 10. *This Book is Gay* by Juno Dawson  I think some of these titles alone imply what's going on here.  But remember, these titles just amount to ten out of thousands of books challenged by parents, politicians and organized groups.  Moving on to data from 2023:  Once again, according to the ALA, there were efforts to censor or ban 4,240 unique book titles in 2023, the highest level ever recorded.  The number of titles targeted for censorship at public libraries increased by 92 percent over the previous year.  But that's not all. An increasing number of bomb threats were called into libraries last year, and librarians themselves have been the target of death threats and abuse. They've also been accused of being pedophiles and ""groomers.""  Now, most libraries have a ""book challenging protocol,"" where anyone can submit a formal request for reconsideration.  But, you can't just go around banning whatever books you want at your leisure. The Constitution and the supreme Court have laid out that, under freedom of speech, information in books, ""cannot be suppressed to protect the young solely from ideas or images that a legislative body thinks is unsuitable for them.""  However, there is a loophole when it comes to exceptions of ""obscenity"" in books that minors have access to. And as I've stated before, conservatives have applied this exception very broadly and vaguely in order to push a book banning agenda.  For instance, in some places, Republicans have ordered that any books containing ""sexual content"" must be moved to another area in the library or even removed entirely.  And as you might have guessed, what falls under the umbrella of ""sexual content"" is typically up to the people pushing for these bans. Some of these books are for sexual education, others contain nothing resembling ""sexual content.""  Prior to 2021, the vast majority of challenges only sought to remove or restrict a single book at a time, but now, over 93 percent of ""censorship attempts"" in public and school libraries involve efforts to remove multiple titles at a time, with more than half of those attempts involving 100 or more books.  I think it's pretty clear at this point that this effort is lacking in all sincerity and is energized by the right's culture wars.   They could care less about ""the children,"" because if they did, they'd be better informed. .  This agenda is about scapegoating and demonizing these marginalized groups, it's about conservatives looking for any excuse to stand by their irrational and ideological convictions, it's about finding any reason to assert that they're the victims of some heinous, radical left agenda that's threatening their white, Christian, heteronormative culture and hegemony.",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-05-03T15:49:31,4
"It's easy - Obscene can mean any media or live performance with any mention of alternate lifestyles like gay or lesbian or childfree or cross dressing or even non-christian.  It means any criticism of MAGA or republican teachings even on newspapers, magazines or television.  It would include any mentions of women working outside the home or living independently.  It can even include jewish teachings or any mention of people of color outside of a subservient role.  Any gay or lesbian character in a show or movie would by definition be obscene.  Greg Abbott may have trouble defining it but he will certainly recognize it when he sees it.",Lobster_roll_dinner,2025-05-03T14:11:54,6
"Is there information on what the punishment will be for the parents and teachers who share the “obscene” material?   Sure, teachers will be afraid to teach anything that could even remotely be defined as obscene, but what next? Do they get fired? Sent to prison? Declared a “home grown” criminal and shipped out after being kidnapped in the middle of the night?   Did the creators even give any examples of “obscene materials” or is it just vague fear mongering as usual? Texas Tribune leaving out a lot of information.",itsbritain,2025-05-03T15:35:37,2

Fair enough, we need laws to exempt certain things. Obviously a doctor is able to talk to a child about their body as an example, so far so good:     ""It is an affirmative defense to prosecution under this section that the sale, distribution, or exhibition was by a person having a bona fide judicial, law enforcement, or legislative ~~\[scientific, educational, governmental, or other similar\]~~ justification.""  They removed educational or scientific as reasons? But look what they kept:  (f)  It is an affirmative defense to a prosecution under this section that:  (1)  ***the defendant was the spouse of the child at the time of the offense***;     CHILD RAPE IS STILL OK AS LONG AS YOU ARE MARRIED TO THE CHILD.

"Texas English Teacher here: Well, I guess I’m teaching Pride and Prejudice, Frankenstein, The Importance of Being Earnest, and Great Expectations from now on. Nothing says ethnic and cultural diversity like British literature from the 1800s [verbal irony, for the dense].  Goodbye to One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, The Shadow of the Wind, The Bell Jar, 1984, Lord of the Flies, The Catcher in the Rye, A Streetcar Named Desire, Their Eyes Were Watching God, and so many other great works.  I’ll be lucky to squeeze in Shakespeare at this rate.   Time for malicious compliance. I will find the cleanest, most seemingly non-threatening works, and I will moralize the shit out of them. I don’t need “controversial” or “diverse” texts to teach ethics and integrity, the very thing these politicians lack. And if they force the Bible on me, then they are going to be in for a surprise when these kids find out about what Jesus actually said about taking care of poor people, widows, orphans, and immigrants.  Teaching disclaimer: some may argue teaching ethics and integrity is not the job of an English teacher. That is false. Every teacher, regardless of the subject they teach, has two areas that they are responsible for—content and humanity. If they neglect one, they fail at both. As adults, teachers have the responsibility to show children the difference between right and wrong, justice and injustice, morality and immorality. Otherwise, we might as well have emotionless AI bots teaching the kids.",Yoyodyn_Banzai_2099,2025-05-03T23:08:24,2
