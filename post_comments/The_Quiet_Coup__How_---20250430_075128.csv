"the dems might not have the numbers to successfully contest it, but they could absolutely be making more noise about this than they are. and the republicans only have a number advantage by a small amount. there needs to be more resistance to the blatant lawbreaking. I also know that there are republican voters who wouldnt approve of whats going on, but they stubbornly stick to media sources like fox news which feeds them propoganda and they reject the notion that they've been had. making more noise could help bring things to their attention that may ultimately sway votes.",Speedj2,2025-05-02T13:36:07,1
