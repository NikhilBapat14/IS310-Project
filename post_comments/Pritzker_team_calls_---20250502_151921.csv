If she wants to run than let her run for office.  I see no issue with that.,Expensive-Cap3159,2025-05-02T15:24:18,10
"Pritzker put the curse on Underwood... ""damaged goods.""  As if to say 'we've all known this all along' while making in up a few seconds right after Durbin announced he was retiring.",fxkatt,2025-05-02T15:36:48,6
"*Copypasted from another thread linking this article*:  Seems like a hit piece by a journalist that hates Pritzker tbh. This is out of character and unlikely to be true, and the sources are anonymous “for fear of retribution.” Probably a corrupt politician who is pissed off about Pritzker. The one cited source is speculation, “I’m sure he is twisting arms behind the scenes.”  Her recent tweets show she’s cozy with Rahm Emanuel and Gavin Newsom in my opinion, or is at least ‘trying to find an angle.’  It’s out of character because he doesn’t seem like the person who would go around slandering people to others. He probably does advocate for candidates he supports like everyone else, he just has a bigger megaphone than most people.   There are valid criticisms of Pritzker, like I’ve heard people call him out for not donating his money because keeping billions can be considered unethical, but you don’t need to go around making up things and lying about him. That’s dishonest in my opinion.",DevinGraysonShirk,2025-05-02T15:51:22,7
"“""If it was an open process, he wouldn’t have chosen Juliana Stratton and given his endorsement of her two days after she announced. So, it’s not an open process,"" Cobb said.”  What does him endorsing a candidate have to do with it being an open process? If anything, his endorsement shows that he’s being open.",Worried-Rub-7747,2025-05-02T15:29:48,3
"If elected, Underwood would be 41 when taking the oath, making her one of the youngest US Senators.   Let that sink in for a brief moment...",LazamairAMD,2025-05-02T15:32:19,4
Both Underwood & Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi are poling 2x higher than Stratton. That's why JB is targeting her. Raja is his next target.,Gotcha_U_Phony,2025-05-02T19:31:56,1
"I want him to clearly explain to everyone what did he mean by ""damaged goods"".  Maybe there are reasoning with this, maybe not.",thieh,2025-05-02T15:26:45,1
What a nonsense article  Imagine if he Didnt support his lt. governor. Yeah. It’s an open process and he’s allowed to support one. He’s not a king maker.   Then the article makes the weird claim about how if he wanted an open process he wouldn’t have attacked the Republican front runner in a different election. Bizarre.,Careful-Moose-6847,2025-05-02T18:14:07,1
">Seems like a hit piece by a journalist that hates Pritzker tbh  That is the feel I got as well, especially after the viral positive attention he got for his speech. I anticipate more of these sorts of articles in future.",Rhaethe,2025-05-02T19:59:19,3
"Exactly, and if he hadn't then people would wonder why the Governor doesn't have confidence in his lieutenant governor.",Lindy2026,2025-05-02T16:42:54,0
"Why does he have to explain that when this is what he actually said?  Pritzker told NBC 5 Chicago's Mary Ann Ahern. ""When there‘s an open opportunity, everybody who’s interested in running should step forward and do so. I would not dissuade somebody from running for public office.""",Brokkyn2024,2025-05-02T15:42:12,6
