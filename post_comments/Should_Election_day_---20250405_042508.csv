Making Election Day a federal holiday will do almost nothing to help voter turnout. Businesses will treat it as a normal workday just like Columbus Day. Mailing a ballot to every registered voter is a much better solution. l,Footwarrior,2025-04-05T20:09:43,16

"No, only because being a national holiday does not mean everyone will be off work. I don't see a legitimate reason we can't have multiple days for the election. Even if it's only 2 days it would give a much greater opportunity for most people to be able to get to the polls and vote. The idea that the election HAS to be finished and decided in less than 24 hours is ridiculous. Give a few days to vote and a week to properly count the votes. There is no reason it HAS to be so rushed, especially with how important the presidential election is.",stantheman1976,2025-04-05T22:41:14,3
Federal holidays don't mean people have the day off.   There's no law prohibiting awesome working Christmas or veterans Day or Labor Day.    Some states have laws that you had to get paid more.

"A ""national holiday"" only benefits the people who are already given the flexibility to go vote.    What we need is a government mandate that states you will give people a day off to go vote during either early voting period or election day.    We can't shut the country down for a day, but we can say that if you want a day off to go vote, once your vote is counted (as recorded by any state agency online, you can look up anyone's voting record) you are given credit for the day to vote.

I haven't voted on election day for as long as I can remember. I vote early. Having said that I think it should at least be mandatory for employers to allow their employees to vote on election day.,[deleted],2025-04-05T20:51:52,1
"In almost all jurisdictions, you have the option of some combination of early voting (which includes both weekday and weekend dates), voting by mail, or time to vote on Election Day by law (your employer must give you time).  So Election Day not being a federal holiday doesn't suppress the vote.  Labor Day, despite its name, is a day off only for those in corporate environments.  Those in retail and food service work on that day, as do some in manufacturing.  The only days that are a day off for almost everyone are Thanksgiving and Christmas.  The biggest problems with voting have to do with long lines at polling places (more are needed) or voter ID requirements.  Here in NY, there is signature verification and no ID is necessary, and there seem to be a lot of polling places (so none is overcrowded).  Additionally, NY's Election Day voting hours are the longest in the nation, at 6 AM-9 PM.  There is also early voting and the option to vote by mail, and your employer must give you time off to vote if there are not two hours before or after your shift when the polls are open.",ANewBeginningNow,2025-04-05T22:06:43,1
Election day should be a national holiday where non-essential services are closed. Voting should be mandatory (raise taxes by $500 for everyone and give a $500 tax credit for voting).

"The best way to stop voter suppression is to have mandatory voting.  If everyone is obligated to vote, then the opportunity to deny the vote is lost.  But this would not be legal in the United States, so it won't happen.  That being said, non-voters don't vote because they choose not to.  Voter participation is driven by peer group behavior.  Those who vote tend to associate with other voters.  Non-voters tend to affiliate with other non-voters.  Republicans try to suppress the vote, but the effort generally fails to reduce turnout.  Democrats attempt to reduce barriers to voting, but that effort generally fails to increase turnout.   Democrats need take the long view and manage programs that provide new peer groups for non-voters so that some of them want to become voters.  That should include relationship building campaigns that focus on getting people interested in having political views and using voting to express those goals, rather than talking at them and telling them how to vote as is typical of campaigns.",I405CA,2025-04-06T10:44:49,1

In a perfect world that could be easily addressed. Ballots could be put in locked boxes until they are counted and security provided to guard them. If we had politicians who truly wanted equal and fair elections they could easily come together and decide these things. The cost would be minimal compared to the benefits.

People have literally no clue how our Constitution works. I mean I get it we've allowed so much Federal overreach and executive power that it looks like we have an all-powerful federal government.   But really we don't not constitutionally,MaineHippo83,2025-04-06T01:55:58,3
For those that think compulsory voting is an infringement of their liberties I ask- do you want to live in a democracy? If the answer is yes - then take some responsibility for maintaining it - being asked to go and vote once every 3-4 years is not a big ask. If you don't want a democracy then why are you worried about your liberties at all?,Clivecustance,2025-04-06T20:30:23,1
Do you not live in the US? Lots of people work on national holidays.  Never been to the grocery store on July 4th? Never grabbed Chinese food on Christmas?,bl1y,2025-04-06T16:40:53,2
That’s how mine is. Early voting isn’t realistic Monday to Thursday 9-12 and half an hour away. It’s not realistic for someone who works 8-4 Monday-Friday. The voting locations is also the county courthouse which isn’t in the largest city in the county. So most people who rely on public transportation can’t actually vote early because they have no way there.,Buckles01,2025-04-06T11:55:23,3
That's how Italy does it.  The school is literally 3 minutes walking distance from our front door.,ColossusOfChoads,2025-04-07T03:58:39,2
The US government doesn't always have the authority to do that.    We have stronger individual rights than most places.  I would have to look at the court cases on this but without an emergency like covid the ability to shut down businesses I believe is limited,MaineHippo83,2025-04-06T01:54:39,6

I suspect the people in power in America might not actually want everyone to vote. They're happier only having wealthy and affluent peoples opinion.,foul_ol_ron,2025-04-05T21:45:10,4
"you're trying to cause problems. if it were trump calling for a holiday so more americans could vote, you would find absolutely nothing wrong with that. of course not everyone could get the day off of work but if it were a paid ""holiday"" millions upon millions more people would be able to vote. and you know it.  and if you're not MAGA, i haven't a clue why you would have a problem with more people voting.",bad_ukulele_player,2025-04-06T19:35:34,1
"Gas stations, no. People can plan ahead and since the election is on a Tuesday, there shouldn't be long trips. Sewers, those that keep the sewers working like the water plants then yes. If it's roto rooter, no. Bus drivers, probably. But that one's open to discussion.",Upstairs-Radish1816,2025-04-06T14:00:49,1
"What could possibly be suspicious about closing voting stations in minority neighborhoods, adding extra identification requirements, and making voter registration harder?",Splenda,2025-04-07T10:02:13,2
"You're just not understanding what a national holiday actually is in the US.  The federal government doesn't control what days workers go to work. When the government makes a national holiday, that affects only people employed *by the government* (and to a degree, contractors for the government).  Have you never noticed how many businesses remain open on holidays? For most federal holidays, *almost no businesses are closed.*",bl1y,2025-04-06T20:33:02,2
"Okay, I see what you're saying. I'm reading the pros and cons from various sources. I still think the nearby Veteran's day could be switched for a national election holiday but you're right that only federal workers would be paid.",bad_ukulele_player,2025-04-07T14:32:53,1
"It's not that only federal workers would be *paid,* but that they're the only ones that would get guaranteed time off, because that's how holidays work.  The federal government simply cannot order every business to close. Nor would that be at all popular. People want to be able to go to the grocery store, or McDonald's, or the gas station, or the bank, or call AAA, and so on. You can look at how many places are open on *Christmas* of all days to get a sense for how much people want to keep businesses open.  What can be done is *states* requiring that employers give a certain amount of time off during the day, which is what many states already do.  Or just have early voting, which is already becoming popular.",bl1y,2025-04-07T15:06:19,1
