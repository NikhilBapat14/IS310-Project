MTG fumbled the bag when she chose to ally herself with Kevin McCarthy only for him to be kicked to the curb. Ever since then she's been more butthurt than usual and desperately searching for opportunities to seem relevant   I hope she decides to run for Senate in 2026 and gets her ass handed to her.,gradientz,2025-05-03T02:24:41,29

"Her district is batshit MAGA, but statewide elections tend to run against MAGA.   Trump tried to pressure the Governor and Secretary of State to find him votes in 2020, and both of them were rewarded by voters for their integrity, not only saying ‚Äúno‚Äù but actually recording and leaking that shit.   If MTG wants to run statewide, she has to become more centrist, and prove to voters she can defy Trump.
