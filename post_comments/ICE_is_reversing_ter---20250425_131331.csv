"How many already got deported or sent to a concentration camp and can't come back?  Seems like the ones that were intimidated enough to self-deport should get some compensation, they blew a lot of money on travel and school because 12-years olds are making decisions on their statuses.",RealGianath,2025-04-25T14:19:23,3
"If you read the article, it’s not a full course correction, it’s just that they are restoring visas while they come up with a “framework” for terminations:  “ICE is developing a policy that will provide a framework for SEVIS record terminations. Until such a policy is issued, the SEVIS records for plaintiff(s) in this case (and other similarly situated plaintiffs) will remain Active or shall be re-activated if not currently active and ICE will not modify the record solely based on the NCIC finding that resulted in the recent SEVIS record termination.”",nic_b2020,2025-04-25T14:34:34,3
Maybe it's the photos folks are taking of ICE agents. Most are newly hired thugs.,williamgman,2025-04-25T13:48:45,2

"The tactic is making everyone feel unsafe and vulnerable. That’s the purpose of the on again off again campaign. Cancel the visas and then reverse the policy, resulting in doubt whether continuing a foreign education is feasible. It’s only been 100 days and it’s been made abundantly clear that visitors aren’t welcome. Tourists are being detained in ICE facilities for days and ultimately deported. Wrong turn on bridges result in deportation, political activism subject to deportation, attending political protests deportation, exercising 1st amendment freedoms deportation. American citizens and children aren’t safe from deportation, and incarceration in foreign mega-prisons without due process. [Due Process](https://youtu.be/b_aXjuEUMoM?feature=shared) is now a matter of debate, and as Holman reiterated “~~segregation~~ deportation now, ~~segregation~~ deportations tomorrow, ~~segregation~~ deportation’s forever.",johnn48,2025-04-26T10:12:03,1

"No. It can be zero more days, as soon as Congress grows a spine and impeaches this motherforker. We don’t have to do this for 1300+ more days. It can end now. ",appleandorangutan,2025-04-25T14:59:21,7
