"It does use it. I used to work there. The ports at Umm Qasr are primarily used for food and medicine as they’re up the Shatt-Al-Arab river and the water isn’t very deep. The US, Japan, and Germany have all assisted in shoring these ports back up for commerce and security operations.   They export oil from the KAAOT and ABOT oil terminals in the Gulf.",GetZePopcorn,2022-08-31T20:28:02,29
"The part of the world Iraq exists in used to be the pinnacle of trade in the ancient world, but modern Iraq is where it is because of its position in geopolitics and the choices of Iraqis and the leaders they select/allow. Nothing about their geography prevents them from being advanced, and they have plenty of resources that the world will be needing for at least the next century.  Until recently they were under crushing sanctions, and after that political and religious sectarian turmoil which continues to this day, as well as outside influence from a very conservative Iran. Until those problems are resolved, they cannot devote the entire country's energy to improving the lot of their people.",periphery72271,2022-08-31T16:59:59,6
"The amount of land that Iraq has on the ocean is  limited.  That is one reason they tried to take over Kuwait years ago.

I just thought it would be more developed. I’m also referring to the surrounding area as well and not just the port.,Kharos,2022-08-31T20:37:30,4
"Basra.   That is the coastal development.   Until modern dams Basra had a lake estuary at the outlet of both the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. It was a major trading port only slightly up a river not unlike London or Hamburg.   But then dams started changing the waterflow and boats got a lot bigger. The lake that used to exist dried up with only a small canal and river still existing. Modern cargo boats can't navigate into Basra as it is easily, and so most port facilities moved onto the actual coast with the ocean. And that's without counting the last 50 years as Turkey has been damning up the Tigris and Euphrates before they ever reach Iraq and using the water for their own agriculture. Iraq now gets only about 30% the water they were getting a century ago, though some of that is probably also related to climate change.",auandi,2022-08-31T21:01:16,20
"The developed part is Basra. The other major inland area there in the south used to be Camp Bucca.   As for the ports, there are two on the SAA. The southern one (“Southport”) is the Iraqi Naval/Coast Guard base. The northern one (“North Port”) is a few KM up the water and it’s the commercial port.",GetZePopcorn,2022-09-01T03:53:33,4
