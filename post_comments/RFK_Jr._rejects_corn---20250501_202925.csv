"Trump appointed *someone who rejects the germ theory of disease* to be in charge of healthcare policies. Would any magas care to explain why this was actually a brilliant choice?  EDIT: By the way, he calls what he believes ""miasma theory,"" but what he describes is a different crackpot theory entirely.

"I’ve posted this quote many times, but it’s never been so appropriate.  *“Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time—when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness.”*  -Carl Sagan *The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark* (1995)",sharp11flat13,2025-05-02T07:38:53,6

Imagine the worst case scenario happens and we’re in a fascist dictatorship that has become so extreme that everyone agrees it is a fascist dictatorship, and by some miracle we escape back to a semblance of democracy after trump dies of old age or whatever. The republicans will turn around and say “who knew It would get this bad ? It wasn’t obvious in the moment”   But that only works so far back as the most recent impeachment attempt. Every Nay vote on an impeachment is a definite, affirmative act of approval for everything the president has done since the last attempt. We should be doing them as often as possible right now so that all the shit-stains that like fascism are forced to admit it again and again every time trump takes another step torward fascism. We shouldn’t leave them the easy out of “The dems obviously didn’t think it would get this bad either or they would have done something.”  Frequent impeachment attempts force all of the fault on the Nay votes.
