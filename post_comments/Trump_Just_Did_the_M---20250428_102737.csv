"Because he isn't a servant of the American people. He's a criminal who seized control of the U.S. government. Calling him President doesn't elevate him, it denigrates and corrupts the meaning of the office and, in turn, the ethos of the country.",BarbaGramm,2025-04-28T10:35:38,26

This just highlights how large a fraud MAGA itself is. Their mouths are all shut tight about all this but they would be flapping them like flounder fins if it was anyone else doing this.  They also appear to have ditched their silly hats.  Never see an individual alone wearing it.,yorapissa,2025-04-28T13:19:18,2

I have to bring this up every time I see this comment:  More eligible voters *did not vote* than voted for Trump in the 2024 election.  That's the massive issue that led to where the US is today.,Actual_Intercourse,2025-04-28T13:16:58,5
Rolling Stone and Salon is pretty bad too. Not with click bait but articles entitled OH NO TRUMP IS A BIG BAD DING DONG WHOâ€™S A JERK AND WE HATE HIM (You Should Be Scared),EyeChihuahua,2025-04-28T14:17:29,2

"I very much agree with you. It just isn't ""the majority of Americans voted for this"". And it especially isn't the majority that wants this. As someone stated, it was a plurality of votes, not a majority. It's still far too many people to vote for the most obvious, historically proven grifter (and racist, and rapist, and idiot, and pedophile (Howard Stern/Access Hollywood interviews with Trump for obvious examples of that, for anyone reading)) in political history.",Actual_Intercourse,2025-04-28T15:36:10,1
"Most people (in the US, especially) simply do not pay attention to politics. I do not think it's because they think what he said was fine - they just think, first and foremost, that even if they *did* pay attention, it wouldn't make a difference. The average working class American citizen is fairly disengaged with politics, even in one of the most polarizing times fuckin' ever. It's a big problem",Actual_Intercourse,2025-04-28T13:43:48,2
