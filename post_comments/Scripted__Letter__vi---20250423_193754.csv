"I’m a big supporter of solar energy but the ITC needs to go. We can continue to support domestic manufacturing by redirecting those funds to grid-scale and large commercial solar projects. Residential solar is not capital efficient except in specific cases, and the market has been taken over by fintech lenders and their sales partners who trick homeowners into predatory financing arrangements based on unrealistic prospects of future returns and various other misrepresentations.  [CFPB](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/research-reports/issue-spotlight-solar-financing/) and [CRL](https://www.responsiblelending.org/media/widespread-residential-solar-energy-adoption-threatened-industry-sales-and-financing-model) have more details on how they operate. That’s who the ITC is really subsidizing. Tax benefits are a key element of their marketing and customer acquisition strategies. Who do you think might be funding this “Solar United Neighbors Action” campaign.  Can’t blame lobbyists for using targeted messaging to maximize engagement—it’s in their nature after all—but I hope people can recognize this for the propaganda that it is.",zip117,2025-04-24T11:04:25,1
