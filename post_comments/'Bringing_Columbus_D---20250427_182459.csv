Culture war bullshit ain't gonna save Trump when every trip to the grocery store is the finanical equivalent of getting punched in the gonads.¬†,tinfoil-sombrero,2025-04-27T18:34:48,41

"Willful ignorance is tRumps forte , anyone who knows the truth of Columbus would cringe at the thought of honoring him",WorkingExperience982,2025-04-27T18:38:43,8
"Being a sadist himself, that comes as no surprise. Columbus was so cruel to his own men, Queen Isabella had him exiled. He was especially fond of cutting off ears and noses. He was a horribly cruel human being. Maybe if Trump read he'd know this.     Edit: Changed sadomasochist to sadist.",invalidpassword,2025-04-27T19:04:19,6

"MAGA in a nut shell is just solving problems that don‚Äôt even exist in the first place. Most places still celebrate Columbus Day.    Also Columbus was actually much worse than most people even realize. Dems didn‚Äôt ruin his reputation, Columbus did that himself, it‚Äôs well documented. I can see though how Trump wants to give sympathy to a criminal rapist given his own history",Carolina_Blues,2025-04-27T19:24:47,2
His ‚Äúaccomplishment‚Äù was being the catalyst for globalization‚Ä¶ at a catastrophic human cost.  So very on-brand for this administration.,OstrichFarm,2025-04-27T19:34:34,2
Are there really people out there still upset about the reputation of Christopher Columbus?  Seems like a weird thing to be upset about.,PopPalsUnited,2025-04-27T19:45:20,2

"Well the core demographic of the Republican party being both stupid and bigoted love these little ‚Äúculture war‚Äù victories like preserving Columbus Day, the war on Christmas, renaming Mt Denali to McKinley, etc. while they go broke under a fascist oligarchy.¬†  Russia acknowledged and weaponized American stupidity/bigotry through Trump which is honestly a brilliant/effective way to destroy the world‚Äôs most powerful nation from within.",JohnnySack45,2025-04-27T19:18:11,1
"Isabel la Cat√≥lica had him arrested for his cruelty. Later the King let him out, but they never put him back in any position of authority. It's agreed that he either committed crimes against the indigenous people or allowed others under his authority to do so.   Spain later cleaned up his image and painted him as an adventurer and visionary, but even they quit trying to keep up the myth decades ago.",Nareshkendel,2025-04-27T21:41:53,1
