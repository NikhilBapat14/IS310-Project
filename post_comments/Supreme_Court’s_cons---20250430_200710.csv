"It so weird how they can use state funding for schools that discriminate against us, but our schools can't discriminate against them.  Honestly, these scotus judges should be removed from office and imprisoned.  For endless violation of constitutional law and rights. Fuck this.  I do not consent to theocracy and I never will.

Separation of church and state shouldn’t be hard but somehow it always seems to be,ChuzzoChumz,2025-04-30T20:25:17,8
"""separation of church and state""  To all tax paying Americans...you either support ALL religious charter schools to use state funds, or NONE!! You cannot have it just for Christian schools. If you cannot agree with this you are NOT American. And no religion should ever be taught in public schools. You cannot force your ideologies onto other kids.",jdlinux,2025-04-30T21:15:11,4
Wasn’t this the “Catholic” school whose aim it was to convert Catholics to evangelism under the guise that they were a real Catholic school? It’s just religious indoctrination,Agreeable_Crow789,2025-04-30T21:26:19,2
"Im not a religious person by any measurement, so idk, but arent the bible-thumping evangelical the biggest pro-trump demographic with regards to religion?  And dont they think catholics are all the debbil?  Wont that get the next Crusades started earlier than it otherwise would have?",TheFlyingBoxcar,2025-04-30T22:08:34,2

Time to avoid paying my taxes on God.,TheWhiteJesseOwens,2025-04-30T22:16:45,1
"I don't want my tax dollars to ever go to any form of public religious charter school institution. They can all fuck off and remain private with donors or paid tuition from students/parents. We have separation of church and state for a good damn reason. If you do this for one religion, you would have to do it for all of them as well.",bhsn1pes,2025-05-01T05:12:04,1

Nope. I bet they wouldn't be fine with the Metropolitan Community Church (MCC) starting charter schools either. That's the Christian church that caters to the LGBT population and has LGBT ministers. It's been around since the 1960s. Imagine a kindergarten class being taught by drag queens.,platanthera_ciliaris,2025-04-30T22:20:13,2
