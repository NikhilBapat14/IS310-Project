"To be clear, they are urging conversion therapy. Depending on how Skrmetti turns out in the Supreme Court, I expect a national ban by the end of the year, with adults next on the list.",WorthyAngle,2025-05-01T11:48:39,36
"Misleading headline as usual.   Part of ""gender-affirming care"" IS therapy.  As in, talking to a professional in social services, with understanding of psychology and related fields, to  sort out your thoughts, feelings, emotions, and navigate through the labyrinth of your own mind, past experiences, present concerns, future aspirations.   What's being proposed isn't therapy, but torture.   Make people feel guilty about their thoughts.  Convince them they're in a phase.   Try to force them into being someone they aren't, ""for their own good.""   Shame them punish them, molest them into conformance  and call it an exposure exercise.   This is what conversion therapy is.  It focuses on  achieving the predetermined outcome.  Actual Therapy is about the recipient's journey, and the road they travel upon, freshly paving it, patching over the potholes, making it a smoother ride",GaimeGuy,2025-05-01T12:15:59,24
"They cited the Cass Review like 150 times and that report has been THOROUGHLY debunked by credible medical experts. The Cass Review was put together by members of the DeSantis administration for the sole purpose of banning gender affirming care for youths in the UK. It was very successful, leading to restrictions on care for adults, the banning of all care for youths, the banning of trans people from facilities that align with their gender identities (bathrooms, shelters, etc.) and now mandatory autism+ADHD tests for any youth seeking gender affirming care in the UK.   These reports are full of lies and demonstrably false medical claims. They don't consult with anyone who has ever treated a trans person. They're not valid medical stances but they're going to be used to restrict care and rights for ALL trans people of any age.   If you were on the fence or one of the Dems saying ""well...the sports thing makes me uncomfortable"", just know that this is the end result of telling trans people to concede some of our rights. We will lose EVERYTHING.",Penguin_Sushi,2025-05-01T11:58:48,32

This administration will cause the most harm to the lgbtq+ community.  Conversion therapy is coming back. Banning Transgender people from basic needs. Banning them from working. Suicide will start to rise. It is all coming.,SAJ-13,2025-05-01T11:57:08,12
"I prefer medical decisions, including mental health, be made with appropriately licensed providers applying best practices as determined by reputable medical bodies in consultation with patients, and in the case of minors, with their parents.

"> “Our duty is to protect our nation’s children — not expose them to unproven and irreversible medical interventions,” National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya said in a statement. “We must follow the gold standard of science, not activist agendas.”  Of so now they like the ""gold standard of science"".

"400 pages of lies, citing the likes of the NYT and Cass, to lay the groundwork to justify banning trans healthcare for youth first (that they define as individuals under 26!) and then certainly for all other adults. Any news org that gives this report credence (especially in headlines, looking at you Axios, PBS, and AP here!) is complicit in the eradication of trans people in the US. This will only harm us. If you're cis you need to speak out against this at every opportunity or you too are complicit.",witchgrove,2025-05-01T13:22:26,4

"Dr Jay Bhattacharya, the director of the National Institutes of Health, is the nasty proto-neo-nazi type, who during the COVID outbreak, advocated a survival of the fittest approach: no masks, no quarantines, just let the 'weak' die so that the survivors could ignore them and go on with their self-centered lives.  Sort of like nonchalantly stepping over corpses on the streets of Calcutta.  A contemptible human being, and not one I would trust to make any medical decisions on my behalf.",nogooduse,2025-05-01T16:01:06,1

"For anyone who might not see what's so bad about this: combine this initiative to strip trans youth of their healthcare and force them into conversion therapy with the administration's proposed defunding of LGBT+ suicide hotlines and it should be *incredibly* apparent what the goal is. They want to inflict mental and physical trauma upon trans folk, while removing the resources they will increasingly need to live through the torture.",UnauthorizedUsername,2025-05-01T13:40:59,5
Yes this should be said every time the Cass Report is mentioned. The US is currently making their own version of it. Conservatives need some veneer of scientific credibility when they talk about things like denying HRT to teenagers. Reminds me of the scientists that were paid by cigarette companies to find that smoking doesn't cause cancer.,Good_Entertainer9383,2025-05-01T12:22:13,10
"The only saving grace that I see from this is that it seems to be so mind-numbingly incompetent that it won't take off in the way the Cass Review did, because that at least pretended to be scientific. Probably why they didn't have any authors taking credit.  One of the included citations in the Trump Review was removed and rather than editing it to be accurate, they just put 404 not found and called it a day. It was absolutely made with AI.",Citizen_Lunkhead,2025-05-01T12:21:50,5
"""If you were on the fence or one of the Dems saying ""well...the sports thing makes me uncomfortable"", just know that this is the end result of telling trans people to concede some of our rights.""  And yet ""the sports thing"" does seem quite unfair to cis women and the numbers bear that out.  When did competing against cis women become a 'right'?  If someone demands all or nothing, most of the time they end up with nothing.  Militancy is its own worst enemy.  The ""sports thing"" - example:  Lia Thomas, swimmer  In the 2018–2019 season: competing in the men's team, ranked 554th in the 200 freestyle, 65th in the 500 freestyle, and 32nd in the 1650 freestyle.  In the 2021–2022 season: competing in the women's team, fifth in the 200 freestyle, first in the 500 freestyle, and eighth in the 1,650 freestyle. Thomas was ranked 89th among male college swimmers for that season.  500m: 65^(th)  ⇒ 1^(st) / 200m: 554^(th)   ⇒  5^(th)  / 1650m: 32^(nd)  ⇒ 8^(th)  Rank: 89^(th)  ⇒ 36^(th)  By the conclusion of Thomas's swimming career at UPenn in 2022, her rank had moved from 65th on the men's team to 1st on the women's team in the 500-yard freestyle, and 554th on the men's team to fifth on the women's team in the 200-yard freestyle. Thomas was ranked 36th among female college swimmers in the United States for the 2021–2022 season, and 46th among women swimmers nationally.   ",nogooduse,2025-05-01T16:10:11,-1
"The US fabricated the Cass Review for use in the UK so that they can cite the sham review they already funded to justify their own ""review"". The document released today is over 400 pages and was made in 3 months. No doctor or scientist in their right mind would ever claim to be able to put together a credible 400 page report in 3 months that adequately analyzes something that takes several years to see results for.",Penguin_Sushi,2025-05-01T12:26:32,8
"I think the bigger concern is that they control all three branches of government and made this as a facade for using that power to ban care. Do the Republicans in the House and Senate care if it's incompetent and false? No, probably not. They'll pass legislation to ban care anyways and point to this document.",Penguin_Sushi,2025-05-01T14:46:19,1
"Why are you only quoting Lia's record after she began estrogen, but before she moved to women's?   Why ignore the lack of trans medalists in the Olympics? No, the boxer the Russians tried to spread rumors about wasn't trans.   Why are you pretending puberty blockers aren't a thing?   You're the problem. You bought all the right wing BS. ",Total_Employ_9520,2025-05-01T17:12:57,4
I agree with your comment about Thomas. The problem is that the way politicians are talking about the issue plays into stereotypes of trans women as dangerous or deviant predators.,JudgePerfectMe,2025-05-01T16:52:41,0
