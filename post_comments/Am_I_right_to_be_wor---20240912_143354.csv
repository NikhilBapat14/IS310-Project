There’s a really good interview with professor Sally (Sarah) Paine from the US Naval War Academy that you should watch. While she covers some of the Russia/Ukraine stuff she outlines how US strategy is formed and will give you a good idea how and why we are doing what we’re doing.,theconcreteclub,2024-09-12T16:27:59,11

"There are two concerns with nuclear weapons.  You mention the strategic one.   The risk of that is no greater than usual.  Putin but also his oligarchs want to remain alive and living in a world where their vast wealth can buy nice things.  Putin knows that nuking even one city, especially one in a third European country will mean the end of Russia and the end of himself.   His own greed and the greed of his friends keeps him from doing that.  The other concern is the use of a small ""tactical"" nuke on the battlefield.  Much much smaller, but still a line that has never been crossed.  The consensus is that if he were to use one, there would be an overwhelming **conventional** response which would annihilate at the very least every Russian unit in Ukraine.   The war would be lost and Russia would be even more of a pariah than it already is.  Most importantly, China does not want Putin to use a nuke either.   They want a world that's more or less what it is now, just with them as the #1 economy instead of the US.  Now that Russia is increasingly dependent on China, they will make sure he doesn't do anything to jeopardize that.",omniwombatius,2024-09-12T16:30:40,16
"I do believe we have to stop Russia. But I understand your fears regarding the cost.  But imagine you have a house with a yard. Imagine you have a neighbor that has a lot more money and they decide to take over part of your yard.  You're trying to kick your neighbor out and reclaim your property.  And then there's people forcing you to the table to sign a peace deal.  However, for you, the only peace deal you would consider is if your neighbor leaves. And the only peace deal your neighbor would consider is if you forfeit the land he already took over.  I'd love a peace deal. Just don't see that being realistic, at this point. Hope I'm wrong.",NumbThoughts,2024-09-12T16:27:52,19
"Ukraine was a very different place in 2010 than it is now. It was a Russian puppet state and their votes were done in the Russian style (heavily rigged in favor of Russia). There was a revolution in 2014 that separated Ukraine from Russia and precipitated Russia's invasion.  Ukraine deserves self-determination and is the line where if Russia gets away with invading a sovereign country for territorial gain, they can get away with anything.  We don't live in the Cold War anymore. There is next to no possibility of global nuclear exchange over Ukraine. Even if Russia uses nukes according to their current nuclear doctrine (small tactical terror bombings rather than the mutually assured destruction of the Cold War), the west has non-nuclear response plans in place. If they use Nukes, it's the end of the Russian Federation. The Ukraine War has revealed that the long feared Russian military is utterly incompetent and underequipped.  Russia is not something to be scared of anymore. Russia is like a rabid skunk; you need to be a bit careful about handling it, but it's still a dying animal that should be stopped.",Volsunga,2024-09-12T16:44:20,10

"Yes, you absolutely have a right to be worried about the Ukraine War.  There are multiple perspectives. I kinda agree with your dad.   I do worry about it going nuclear. As kids, we had nuclear war drills in classrooms, unlike the active shooter drills kids experience today.  The reason I agree with your dad is we lost a lot, globally, by letting a manically power-hungry authortian run rampant in the 1930's & 1940's. And the others in the then 'Axis of Evil.'  The Big question, and the lesson of history is, 'what if we stopped him sooner than later.'  To many, the current leader of Russia is committing similar crimes against humanity and violating most Geneva Conventions (rules during warfare).  Specifically targeting non-combatats, civilians, for example   Putin hasn't backed down despite the economic strains it's putting on common citizens.  He is also backed into a corner, making it necessary to say he'll use nuclear warefare to appeal to people like you to convince others & possibly elected officials to back down.  Increased pressure & support for Ukraine is necessary to press home the message that you can't invade your neighbors, destroy their civilization, and get away with it.   His actions are criminal. As the leader of a former superpower, it magnifies the size & scope of his crime.  The idea is very outdated from a civilization perspective.   Yes, I feared nuclear holocaust when this started.   Given how the US extremely, vastly, bigly, out spends everyone else on the planet on military defense, offense space force DOD, CIA, NSA, DARPA, & ETC., I have to believe that it's not necessary to worry about World War III.  This was reaffirmed by just how poorly Russia's military exercise in Ukraine was executed and how poor the equipment & training were.   This gives me hope, and sometimes that's all we have, that Russian nuclear capabilities are as poor and weak as its ground operations.   And if that's the case, we should support efforts to bring it to a definitive end, especially BEFORE it gets to World War III.  It doesn't benefit us, China, India, Europe, or the others, to engage in global conflict again.  Cooler heads are and will continue to prevail.   And if you're still uncertain, join the armed services or the national guard.",12-Easy-Payments,2024-09-12T16:39:26,5
"Most experts aren't actually that concerned about the threat of nuclear war, and they're almost certainly right. The idea that any armed conflict with Russia will inevitably go nuclear is disproven by the fact that Russia is currently in an armed conflict that hasn't gone nuclear. The basic concept of MAD is a relic of 1950s Cold War mentality, and basically since at least 1970 we've moved well beyond that idea. Hell, we spent most of the 1960s trying to figure out how to actually use nukes and never could find a way. Cold War history has made clear that these fears are unfounded. Any argument that we should enable Russia out of nuclear fear is one that is not particularly well informed.  Plus, yeah, of course everyone prefers bringing both sides to the peace table. But can you explain how we do that? They two sides aren't the peace table right now not because they just love war so much, but because one side or both are unhappy with the current state of things, so much to the point that they'll fight about it. Do you actually have a plan for peace that's something other than ""allow Russia to just win?"" If so, call the White House and collect your Nobel Peace Prize.",mormagils,2024-09-13T12:28:57,2
Putin promised he wouldn’t invade Ukraine if they gave up their nuclear weapons. They did so and Putin still invaded Ukraine. You can’t trust anything Putin agrees to. It sucks he is such a slime ball leader.,Surfbarnacle,2024-09-13T01:50:48,4
"First Russia using nukes is very low when it comes to the scale of of game over for the planet. There are two types of nukes and one is for smaller strices (attacking a city in Ukraine) and the other is sending it all the way to the USA. The thing about nukes is they are a good detourinte until they are used. If Russia used one they know that the EU and USA would go all in on supporting Ukraine. Also the two biggest countries that have backed Russia (China and India) have told Russia no nukes or any support will end. These two countries are most what is holding the Russian economy up by tape and tooth picks.   There is also the fact that USA and EU know every location of land based nukes and most if not all the the subs. There was a articial stating that the USA could take out Russias and China's arsenal in 2 hours. This is on top of there is a lot of question on how much of Russian's arsenal is in working condition as two thing Russia is good at is good at is corruption and lying.   If Russia takes over Ukraine they will get a lot of people (something Russia is really lacking in now) a lot of resources, and a lot of people with good experience    at making weapons and how to fight. They also have a lot of western weapons and know how to use and maintained them so Russia will get a nice boost to their technology of weapons because this was is showing how much they are lacking now. The last thing food, Ukraine is the grain belt if the EU and if Putin can control that he gains a lot of power.   The EU and the USA would also look very weak and this could cause a lot of countries to switch over to Russia and Brics and this would just empower Russia to take more land. Putin wants to USSR back so that means taking back a lot of land. If Putin wins in Ukraine this will encourage him to keep going and increasing the chances of WW3 but if he is stopped in Ukraine politically he is very weak and there is a good chance he might fall out of a window.   One last thing is there are many ways to fight Russia and this is why the sanctions are working so well, and going after the oligarcies property. The oligarcies are ok with war because they normally make money off of that because they are the ones making money off of it. This time they are losing money and that will hurt them a lot. If we can control this and get a Ukraine win then China will back off the land grabs they are trying to do in the pacific. Iran is also friends with Russia and would get help from a empowered Russia so you would see more issues in the Middle east.   So this isn't just about Ukraine and Russia as China, Iran, and N Korea are big players in this and if they see the west as weak they will start doing more and this is how you get WW3.",mawkishdave,2024-09-12T16:49:06,2

"Hey! For some reason this is an unpopular opinion but I totally agree. I do not want to see this escalate to WWIII.  I also found it alarming during the debate when Harris said she intended to *win* the war.  Whereas Trump stated he wanted to negotiate and end the war to save lives, as soon as possible.  Do I think that he had any detailed explanation of HOW he was going to do it? No. But I don’t want to win the war either, and his intentions were *for once* in the right place. If everyone gets to keep their original boundaries, let’s negotiate an end asap.  Putin has put out multiple statements indicating he is open to negotiation.  Harris doesn’t seem to want to go that route, and I suspect there’s a reason as to why.  Often the US has continued wars to gain control over other countries resources, for financial and economical benefits of war, for control etc.  She seems like someone who is more inclined to go that route unfortunately.",yesterdaysnoodles,2024-09-14T15:14:15,1
