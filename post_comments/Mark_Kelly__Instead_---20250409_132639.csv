The only fair answer is to repeal the trump tax cut for the rich. Lift the social security threshold. Expand medicare. Top it off with wealth tax on 1 percent.,ShoutOutMapes,2025-04-09T13:42:07,7
How bout no tax cuts and Americans remember paying taxes is a patriotic duty. How bout instead of cutting taxes we give the people healthcare and a living wage and stop subsidizing corporations. ,Ashamed_Job_8151,2025-04-09T20:15:18,2
I personally don’t agree with anyone getting a tax break. We have a 2 trillion dollar deficit and not nearly the safety net we need as a country. In order to do what we need then revenues will need to be raised on more than the wealthy.,perilous_times,2025-04-09T20:08:57,1
