I'd much prefer Biden sit out this fight if he's not willing to throw haymakers at this point. Trump shits on him 24/7 and Biden still feign decency out of respect for office. He shows Trump more respect than he did voters.  I also never agreed with the arbitrary restrictions on where Ukraine can retaliate.,longtermattention,2025-05-07T02:34:47,9
"If you're not going to call him out by name, sit back and shut up. This is the problem with Democrats. It's like they're in a golf tournament with Trump who takes gimmies, mulligans and lies on his scorecard while they play by the rules and are afraid to call him out.",theflower10,2025-05-07T06:31:32,7
"These fucking democrats need to figure their shit out because clearly taking the passive approach is not working. You have nothing to lose, Joe… name and shame!!",_Captain_Random_,2025-05-07T07:05:28,3
"Old Democrats and their lofty moral standards. Still keeping with norms and not directly criticizing the next president, even if he’s a fascist dictator.",C__S__S,2025-05-07T08:07:15,3
“Modern-day appeasement”   Is this supposed to be harsh? What does modern even mean in this context? Strange phrasing,P4ULUS,2025-05-07T08:47:41,1
