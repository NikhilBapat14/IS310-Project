Not enough people in here asking why the government is even in the student loan business to begin with. I think there was one comment on it.   Everyone is celebrating the government collecting on the debts (which they should if they exist) but not calling for the government to get out of the student loan business to begin with.   Government backed loans and the inability to discharge loans in bankruptcy has been catastrophic. It has removed any risk in lending and allowed colleges to raise costs and lenders to profit with zero risk.   Make loans unsecured and creditors will have to weigh the risk and the reward. Degrees will increase in value and no longer be the new high school diploma as admission rates drop as only the best students pursuing the best degrees will be given loans as the they’ll be the lowest risk to lenders. Costs will also come down as enrollment drops.,General-Gold-28,2025-04-23T08:24:25,615

"I’m of two minds on this.  On the one hand, I’m very much about personal responsibility, and anybody taking out tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars of loans should really be doing all the research they can before signing on the dotted line. You bite off that chunk, you better chew and swallow it.   On the other hand, a lot of these people have been promised a lie from childhood. Follow your dreams and pursue your passions to the end and you will be successful in life. Not the truth, which is that somebody’s gotta shovel shit and bury garbage. We don’t all get to be astronauts and actors. But they grew up believing everything they were told by adults and by their teachers, pursued their passions instead of practical careers in fields that are desperate for experts, took out a bunch of money in loans to get a piece of paper that says they can do the things they can do so that they are eligible to be hired, and then found out that there are way more people trying to get into their field than there are jobs for them to take.  One of them could be making $100,000 a year as a plumber with no student loans in the first place, but none of them wanna get their hands that dirty.    My brother-in-law has spent the better part of a decade pursuing a career in music, going to a school to get a degree, dragging his family all over the country, only to wind up with a job he could’ve gotten without any schooling whatsoever. He was told, and believed the lie that he needed to have a piece of paper to validate his talent as a prerequisite for employment. He got hired by an advertising firm who heard his work that he submitted and felt that he could do what they needed him to do- create little jingles for advertisements. One of the other people working for the firm only has a high school diploma as their highest academic achievement.

"The entire situation is a lose-lose no matter which way you go.  Which makes the question one of mitigation; what solution resolves the problem on the least painful way?  First, I think we're all in agreement that the high cost of the loans needs to be resolved as it results in these predatory loan arrangements that are the root of the problem.  That's an easy fix; eliminate the government subsidies and shift the risk back onto the colleges.  That resolved the problem moving forward, but it still leaves us with the existing problem of people currently caught in these loans.  We have three options.  1) garnish wages, pensions, etc.  basically everything short of debtors prison.  Force them to pay back the loan in full.  ""They agreed to it so they have to pay it back, and I shouldn't have to pay for one cent of their loan!"". This is, generally speaking, the ""principled conservative"" position.  2) we still require the loans to be paid back, but we change the terms somehow.  Eliminate the interest payments and make the person liable for the loan responsible only for the principal only or something.  3) we write off the loans entirely and wipe the slate clean so to speak.  This tends to be leftist, progressive position.  All three options have problems, but I think 1 and 3 have particularly unpleasant problems compared to 2.  Starting with the first option, the principled conservative route.  We do that and it will mean we hand the government to the other side for an entire generation.  It will be seen as unjustly punishing the victim, even moreso given that we will be tacitly agreeing that the loan practices were predatory and unjust (hence why we would have fixed them so future students didn't get hit with these loans).  Option three carries all the negatives for giving shit away for free.  It discourages responsibility, harms motivation and ambition, leads to stagnation, and all that jazz.  This being a conservative discussion board I don't think I need to go into detail about the negatives of this option; most everyone is aware.  I think striking a balance, option 2, is the best option.  It will still cost votes in elections, and it will still crack open the door to all the negatives of giving shit away for free... But it isn't catastrophic in either direction.  The negatives can be managed, unlike with either of the two other options.",Shadeylark,2025-04-23T07:57:59,147

"So I'm gonna address this in two parts.  I'll start with the part that is good; eliminate the government subsidy of student loans.  It makes it too easy and appealing for universities to adopt pricing strategies that leave prospective students at the mercy of predatory loan sharks, because the government assumes all the risk.  But the part that isn't good, and an opinion that's gonna piss of all the ""principled conservatives""... If garnishing the wages and going after pensions of people who default on student loans is the hill you want to die on... You will die on it.  There are too many people who are in default, and they will have too much sympathy from their cohorts who aren't in default themselves (but recognize that but for the grace of God they could be), for this to be seen as anything but unjust and it will cost you elections.  Now I already hear the objections, ""if you couldn't pay it back you shouldn't have taken it out!"" And in a perfect world where ideals match reality I would absolutely agree.  But we don't live in a perfect world, and I guarantee you that if you go after people who default on their student loans it will not be viewed by the younger generations, who now make up the majority of the voting population, as anything but unjustly punishing the victim.  All the gains we've made with younger voters to ensure we can undo the mistakes of the left will be undone in one swoop if you go ahead with any plan that will, I guarantee, be seen as punishing victim.  And again, you can argue that you're taking a principled stand, and I won't say you're not... But in the end your principles won't change the fact that this will *not* be received well and it will have negative consequences when it comes to ensuring we win elections in the future.  So if you want to do this, recognize that it will mean dying (metaphorically speaking) for your principles.  You're not gonna get a second chance if you go ahead with this...

So you can decide if you want to stand on principle and stand a high chance of losing, or if you can stomach a compromise for a middle ground and live to fight another day.

"I'm not old, and I agree with them 100%.   My wife and I graduated from undergrad with some debt. I continued to obtain my doctorate while she went to work, and I worked ~24 hours per week. We lived on as little as we could, because as long as we had debt, we were broke. I don't remember at this point how much my wife was making, but our combined income was definitely below 60k. We used cash flow to fund my doctorate, and had the rest of the loans paid off within months of my new job because we continued to live like the broke new grads that we were.   Meanwhile, while in school, my classmates went to parties and bars often more than once per week, spending tons of money they didn't have. Upon graduation with their bigger salary, they were buying new houses, fancy trucks, and much more. I don't know of a single one that isn't still in debt >5 years later, because it's simply not a priority for them. That's fine, they're free to choose how to live their life, but don't expect that burden to be shifted onto taxpayers like my wife and I who did the responsible thing and made sacrifices to honor our agreement. ",TheEternal792,2025-04-24T08:29:38,1

It always felt a little off, somehow, that someone could get the 'benefit' of lower loan payments (and eventual 10yr forgiveness) by claiming super low personal wages, but actually gets to live off much higher duel-income wages.    Do we give out food stamps and Medicare subsidies for one person of a dual-income, married couple by their individual income?  Not usually, it goes by household.
