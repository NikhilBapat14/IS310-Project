The pain has to be big enough to both ensure a large enough GOP wipeout to shatter the MAGA wing of the Republican party and allow real conservatives to take back over and to give the democrats a large enough majority to remove Trump from office.,Prestigious-Ad54,2025-04-29T12:42:14,12
It’s going to be interesting to see if Donny shows up at the G7 summit in Kananaskis in June.,Senior-bud,2025-04-29T19:53:39,1
"Unfortunately, the Obama-era status quo that you’re seeking is gone, and it’s never going to come back.  The Republican Party will be defined through the lens of Trumpism for the foreseeable future.  Further, Trump only exists because of the weakness that defined those “real conservatives” you mentioned.  McCain and Romney ran utterly pathetic and out-of-touch campaigns that forced many conservative voters to look for more extreme options, and regardless of whether or not they like Trump himself, they’re largely unified on the core aspects of what defines his political philosophy.",shimmy_kimmel,2025-04-29T12:48:15,6
Real conservatives are too terrified of their own constituents to get anywhere near that situation. They know if they stand up for what’s right they’ll put their families in danger and have attempts made on their lives.,Economy_Ambition_495,2025-04-29T17:09:44,1
