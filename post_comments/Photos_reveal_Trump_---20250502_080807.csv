The fact that they are doing this repeatedly means that the problem is not ignorance or incompetence.  It's malice.  It's treason.  It's espionage.  They are deliberately making it easier for spies to spy on America.  Experts already explained this to them and they keep doing it.  They cannot claim ignorance or incompetence anymore.

"Maybe I'm wrong, but is this a bad thing?  Presidential Records Act requires these communications be archived. Signal is known for it's end-to-end encryption preventing unauthorized viewing of chats, but also for it's feature to automatically delete conversations after a set period of time.  This new app will archive these conversations, so that they are able to continue to communicate in a Signal-like interface they are familiar with, while also being compliant with the Presidential Records Act.  On it's face, I see that as a good thing. As long as 1. they aren't using this app for Department of Defense or other classified communication, and 2. the storage of these archived records are being done in a secured safe manner.  The company that created this app, is Israeli, but it seems was bought out recently by an American company, Swarm? I'd like to know what authority vetted this app and service, but if it's in compliance with federal law, I think this is exactly what we were asking for, right?",WhatIsLoveMeDo,2025-05-02T10:20:42,-16
