"The point of this takeover isnt so much to DO anything.    But to PREVENT the DC bar from disbarring all members of the ""Justice"" Dept. for their misdeeds.      Bove, Sauer, or AG Bondi herself wouldnt want to face this embarrassment.      They are assaulting the rule of law from all fronts:   government lawyers, private lawyers, law schools, bar associations, judiciary",telerabbit9000,2025-04-25T16:45:59,36

Can I get a Pete Hegseth. Yes I know it’s just a bottle and a straw. Straw so he doesn’t ruin the makeup.,now_error_later,2025-04-25T17:24:29,2

It’s an election to which bondi brother is just running for. It’s just participating in the dc bar elections. ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-04-25T16:56:52,-22
They will also want to disbar any opponents.,justsomeguy73,2025-04-25T18:15:39,12
"There’s another angle here in that it’s DC, the city housing thousands if not tens of thousands of federal employees who just got let go. Early in February a bill was introduced to end DC home rule.   Everyone’s looking at this summer being a big protest summer when students can join those laid off workers. Add in people pissed at rising prices and DC is going to be a likely flashpoint for anything that happens.",Ja3k_Frost,2025-04-25T19:36:49,7
It’s not an assault? It’s an election. He’s running for it. It’s called being democratic. ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-04-25T16:56:05,-28

Sure. Completely normal. Nothing to see here.  I'm sure Bondi's brother will have no conflict of interest at all!,telerabbit9000,2025-04-25T17:01:01,12
Absolutely normal! Like everything else Trump has been doing! I agree!    I'm sure Bondi's brother will have no conflict of interest at all!,telerabbit9000,2025-04-25T17:01:21,14
I really don’t know. But many lawyers have family  members who are in politics ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-04-25T17:04:07,-14
I agree! We should treat this as completely normal! It's not like anything extraordinary has happened in last 100 days!,telerabbit9000,2025-04-25T17:05:38,9
