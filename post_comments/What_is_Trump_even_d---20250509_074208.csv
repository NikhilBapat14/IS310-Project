The last 10 years have kind of been surreal as it has exposed just how completely different a reality so many of us live in.   I can accept a huge chunk of the American electorate didn't/doesn't realize Trump is an idiot bigot asshole.  It's when journalists and oligarchs don't realize putting the Mad King in charge was a terrible idea for them that confuses the hell out of me.,CT_Phipps-Author,2025-05-09T07:47:03,649

(Witness his marking up of a weather map circa 2019 for Hurricane Dorian.)    He is incapable of thinking things out.  It's all the impulsive thought of the moment.  And then within hours or days his mind wanders to another idea.  ""_China tariffs: 150%_"" and a few days later: ""_Okay it's 80% - except for those Chinese Yo-Yos, I love those, only 5% on the Yo-Yos!!!_""    And thus ...  ... **Chaos.**",drtolmn69,2025-05-09T08:02:05,24

Screw you.”   He doesn’t really care about the consequences, so long as he makes money and gains power.   He’s ultimately a conman. The elite know this. His cult are just marks.   The only people Trump likes are rich people who suck up to him. He sees this as validation: “this guy is rich and successful, and he is sucking up to me, which makes me even more powerful”. ",MayIServeYouWell,2025-05-09T10:33:23,5

I am so very glad that the country will become more safe since the invasion at the borders has been virtually eliminated and more and more illegals are deported many of them violent criminals.   Another thing as time goes on is more and more revenue from oil production.  Which could ultimately be what can help balance the federal budget at least and bring down the deficit hopefully.  And provide potential tax cuts and funding for better law enforcement and exciting things like expanded space exploration.    All of these things can make for greater opportunities for every citizen of our great country. Reducing poverty across the country.  Which further creates a more prosperous country.

"Because the press didn't actually do their job. Negative coverage of Biden on the campaign trail vastly outweighed coverage of Trump. Biden could stutter, and headlines would run for weeks about how it's not clear he's fit for office. Trump makes clearly racist comments, and it's a subheading that gets mentioned once and never again. If you look at coverage of Trump in particular compared to nearly every major presidential candidate for the last few decades, it's abundantly clear that the press either didn't know what to do with some of the things he did and said because they were so outlandish, or they were biasing coverage. Most candidates would have had their campaigns end instantly if they'd done even one of the many bizarre and offensive things he's done over the years. Howard Dean's campaign fell apart just because he got excited and yelled weirdly and the press ripped him apart for it.",isugimpy,2025-05-09T09:51:21,27

I think the bad stuff they covered about Biden stands out to people because it's infuriating to hear criticism of the guy who is clearly competent while the bad stuff about Trump is everyday background noise -- we know he's a liar, thief and a bigot - nothing about anything he could do would stand out.  There's also the question of ""which press"". I listen to public radio and NPR and I can assure you they covered trump extensively. They carried the question of Biden's fitness too. Was it too much?

"Here's an AI result that I worked on for a while:      **The Book of Malachiah**   *Chapter 3*  ¹Woe unto the city whose walls are adorned with banners, whose gates are brass, and whose judges fatten themselves on the pleas of the poor.   ²For they say, “Come, let us reason together,” yet their scales are false and their counsel is sold for silver.   ³They make long prayers in the public square, but trample the needy in the threshing floor.   ⁴And a certain elder rose among them, called Tobiah the Upright, though his ways were crooked.   ⁵And he taught his sons, saying: “Be as one with thy kindred, and generous to thy household—”   ⁶“—and if a man be in thy debt, treat him like family … exploit him.”   ⁷And the people said, “This is wisdom,” and they wrote it upon their tablets and their hearts.   ⁸They said of the orphan, “Let him rise early and bear the yoke, that he may be found worthy of bread.”   ⁹They said of the widow, “Let her be employed, and cease from tears; for idleness is not righteousness.”   ¹⁰They spake loudly at the gate: “The poor are poor by sloth, and the rich by favor; therefore give honour to whom honour is due.”   ¹¹The widow came with her jar of flour, but was sent away. The orphan stretched out his hand, but it was slapped aside.   ¹²For the merchants had learned to speak peace while setting snares.   ¹³**Thus saith the Lord**: *“That which is mine is mine, and that which is thine is mine also.”* Blessed is the man that keepeth increase, and suffereth it not to pass from his hand.",mpworth,2025-05-09T22:58:47,1
