"Cuellar gets it. His district is on the border so he sees illegal immigration firsthand and knows the damage it does, unlike the bleeding heart liberals far away on the east and west coasts. Even the Latinos in his district are angry that millions have come here illegally and been catered to while they did it the correct way and were given nothing.",social_dinosaur,2025-04-27T07:39:43,33

"Rep. Henry Cuellar is pushing back against his own party over its stance on immigration, criticizing fellow Democrats for defending an illegal immigrant the Trump administration says is a violent MS-13 gang member.   If democrats are going to die on this hill, dead they will be!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-27T09:13:42,16
It truly is hilarious. Illegal immigration and the border was a top 3 issue in the last election cycle and was a major reason why the democrats lost. They’re still pounding the table on an issue which led to them losing in the first place.,sunkenship13,2025-04-27T13:44:47,7

"Exactly this.  He says they picked the wrong battle, as if there is a correct battle in this issue.  No... No there is not.  No matter who you pick to defend on this one, you are in the wrong.",Shadeylark,2025-04-28T06:42:56,3
