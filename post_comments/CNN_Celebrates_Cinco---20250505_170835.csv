"Folks within my orbit, friends, and acquaintances who are Mexican have  said to me probably a million times, we Americans make a big deal out of Cinco de Mayo as a reason for a night out drinking margaritas and tequila, Mexican folks don‚Äôt really give two shits.",cliffotn,2025-05-05T17:12:04,64
I've never understood why Cinco de Mayo is a thing here in the USA. It's the anniversary of a battle that Mexico won a long time ago. Why should America care?,maitlandia,2025-05-05T17:19:22,32
Who seriously makes up this BS and actually writes an article about it?,Iamstillhere44,2025-05-05T19:14:04,3

They're media holidays; the media is a religion. Pre-Elon Twitter had some important sounding name for every third day of the year.,D_Ethan_Bones,2025-05-05T17:21:39,19
"Indeed, only the region of Puebla celebrates it. I have to say, it is pretty badass. Mexico owed France *a lot* of money so Napoleon sent some soldiers to collect.  Well, the Mexican army got driven back to Puebla and made their stand against a much larger French army...and won!  I get why they celebrate it, but for me, I'm more of a Cinco de Cuatro kinda guy.",Kahnspiracy,2025-05-05T21:48:46,9
Real answer: American beer companies commandeered it as a party holiday to sell more beer,MiceTonerAccount,2025-05-05T18:54:39,29
