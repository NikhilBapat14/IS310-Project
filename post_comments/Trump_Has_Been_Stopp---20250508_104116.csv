I had three stop signs and a dozen traffic lights on my way to work this morning.  If I'd ignored them all I'm pretty sure that would be the bigger story.,OkayComputer1701,2025-05-08T10:58:21,12

"That's really quite inaccurate. The administration has complied almost every time by releasing funds or reinstating workers. It's just no one pays attention to the resolution that comes weeks or months after the fact - it doesn't make the news. There are only a handful where the administration isn't complying (yet). But even there they've typically had some kind of legal gymnastics to justify their refusal, even if it's a bad faith argument. Or the case is still going through appeals. The perception that the admin is defying the courts is what they WANT you think. Because if you believe they are already doing it, there won't be spontaneous outcry when they actually, eventually DO.",MommyLovesPot8toes,2025-05-08T17:15:26,36

"So what is he gonna do with the uk deal get the 1 percent tariff dropped to zero? Wow yes that was clearly worth crashing our economy by effectively making a trade embargo with china.   Im not blinded in the least, im the opposite, educated enough to see that he took a ridiculous, haphazard, and unplanned approach to a trade war and china called his bluff.  Capt dumpsterfire for some reason thought it was a good idea to levy a tariff larger than the smoot-hawley tariffs on 100% of imports…. By the way smoot-hawley was only on 25% on imports and smaller in percentage than his base 10%…. And that was enough to cause the great depression.",Fun-Rice-9438,2025-05-08T19:21:21,0
"Yes, because like any bully, Trump/Musk always back down when sufficiently challenged.   Also, the bureaucrats tasked with actually implementing unlawful/paused actions don't have the legal immunity Trump has, and could actually face consequences for defying the courts.",mom0nga,2025-05-08T19:02:39,9
"No. Your very words scream hate. You’re as blind as the proverbial bat when it comes to, ‘you know who’. The tariff deal with the UK was cheered enthusiastically on both sides of the Atlantic.  He is dealing with China, who needs us more than we need them in any sort of trade contest. The economy isn’t nearly close to crashing. Jobs are being added. Even the price of eggs, always an indicator of economic prosperity don’t you think,is coming down, even after Biden had all those millions of chickens killed (In the ‘Fowl’ community, the name Biden is equated with Hitler). The first quarter of the year belonged to Biden economically and you people know it. Judge Trump by what is coming up in the rest of 2025. If it’s bad you’ll trumpet it, and if it’s good, you’ll twist and distort it, per usual.  If you fancy yourself to be so educated, then why bring up ‘Smoot-Hawley, which was mostly about agriculture prices, and isn’t nearly relevant to what is happening today. You feel that Act is the linch pin of the economy and Trump is ignoring it and in fact running roughshod over it to our peril. I thought you bragged that you were educated.   If you honestly feel that another ‘Great Depression’ is looming, then I’ll conclude my post immediately so you can go to the bank and withdraw all your money before they all close down and you are left with nothing. Similarly, you must go to your local ‘Whole Foods’ and surreptitiously begin to hoard your groceries. Make sure that you grab a lot of Brie and other similar treats so that you can shelter in style in the dark years to come.",Optimal-Reaction5085,2025-05-08T20:05:12,0
