"FTA >> It’s go time in Washington for the GOP reconciliation bill, as House committees this week begin to flesh out their respective pieces of a plan to cut both taxes and spending. Which means Republicans finally must grapple with an ugly truth within the party of “limited government”: Most of them don’t want to cut spending on anything.",Ask4MD,2025-04-30T14:38:16,56
Congressional Republicans haven't changed since 2017; they are going to sabotage Trump's agenda out of spite. They're the Canadian boomers of the USA.,r4d4r_3n5,2025-04-30T18:52:51,7
It's probably wishful thinking but it makes sense to keep the status quo until they can figure out what cuts will be effective and not catastrophic. Unfortunately if they cut too much it can obviously have unintended consequences which will be easy for the Democrats and media to jump on and prevent future Republican victories if we actually can use Doge and other means to figure out what can be cut exposed fraud and other issues then there's a good chance it will be part of the future resolutions. But we'll see,fordr015,2025-04-30T15:15:37,7
"Should say POLITICIANS not just republicans.   Every time they say cut spending, they mean they are going to increase spending just not as much as they originally planned.  DOGE is valuable because it is showing where waste and fraud actually are.   Maybe if we held the politicians feet to the fire and didn't just vote for whoever is on the ballot but actually got involved in the ballot and started getting those who wont be more fiscally responsible out, it might actually help. But we have to try it for a change.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-30T15:33:24,1
"This is disheartening.  Unfortunately there is no party of 'limited government'.  That is why I left the Republican party ~20 years ago, and registered Unaffiliated.  There are only the party of 1000% reckless spending and the party of We'll Lie to you About Not Liking Reckless Spending.",Kahnspiracy,2025-04-30T23:11:21,21
"Brings up a fear of mine…    Imagine DOGE manages to uncover more and more fraud and waste - exponentially more than we ever imagined.  That plus a good economy and the US actually gets a grip on debt.    What would Congress do with that fat savings?    We know the sad and pathetic answer is they’d spend it all, and then we’re back to where we started.",cliffotn,2025-04-30T15:10:14,24
I'm not sure if it qualifies as a catch-22   But you need to stay in power to reduce the deficit. But reducing the deficit means you won't stay in power,Dutchtdk,2025-05-01T04:30:32,3
What they should do is reduce taxes.,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-30T15:33:58,-4
