"Well the most famous example was Napoleon's disastrous campaign to Russia.  We can't attribute Russian Winter alone in all of its victories against invaders, but in Napoleon's case, it was a matter of clever scorched Earth tactics and hit-and-run attacks throughout the country, even sacrificing Moscow in order to buy time for Winter to deal a crushing blow to his army.  Basically, Russia knew Napoleon loved a good fight, so they retreated, baiting him into seeking battle deeper into the heart of enemy territory before trapping them with the winter. Napoleon felt compelled to seek a fight so he kept stretching his forces thin until his army was forced to retreat, facing daily harrassment by petty forces on their way out until he returned to France with less than 50,000 units.   So its not so much about Russian Winter but more about how to take advantage of it to defend the Motherland against its enemies.",swagonflyyyy,2025-05-10T10:12:42,1
If the Ural Mountains were to Moscowâ€™s west instead of east history would be very different.,New_Seaweed_6554,2025-05-10T11:13:14,1
