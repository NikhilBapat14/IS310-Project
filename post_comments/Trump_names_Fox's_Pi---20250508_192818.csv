"The world: Ma’am , how are you qualified for this position?  Pirro: uhhh, I’m on Fox News. Duh.",Ok-Magician818,2025-05-08T19:31:33,11
"Yet another example of Trump picking people he sees on TV. Every single person on Fox knows that every one of their broadcasts is an audition for the Republican administration.  Excerpt from the article: ""President Trump announced Fox News host Jeanine Pirro as the interim U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C., after withdrawing his earlier pick.  ""Jeanine is incredibly well qualified for this position, and is considered one of the Top District Attorneys in the History of the State of New York,"" Trump posted on social media on Thursday.  He listed Pirro's experience as a prosecutor and state judge in New York and said she was a ""crusader for victims of crime."" The announcement continues a trend of nominating people from the Fox network to key roles in his administration. Pirro is a co-host on ""The Five"" and previously hosted ""Justice with Judge Jeanine.""  His earlier pick, Ed Martin, a longtime Republican activist with no previous prosecutorial experience, had been serving as the interim U.S. Attorney in the nation's capital since Trump's inauguration. He faced unified opposition from Senate Democrats and pushback from some key Republicans.  The U.S. Attorney's office in Washington, D.C., along with its counterpart in Manhattan, is widely considered among the most important federal law enforcement roles in the country.  Like Martin, Pirro was a Trump loyalist who helped promote the false theory that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.  She was named as central in a defamation lawsuit against Fox News by Dominion Voting Systems. The election machine and technology company accused Fox and several of its stars including Pirro of spreading baseless claims that the firm tried to throw the presidential race to Joe Biden over Donald Trump in 2020.""",zrv8psgOS9AiWK6ugbt2,2025-05-08T19:29:14,7
"Trump's on a wild losing streak.  Kindly carry on, Sire.",XSinTrick6666,2025-05-08T19:33:16,3
A compliment to Trump.  He has always proven that America is the land of opportunity.  And you don't have to be qualified.  You don't have to be intelligent.  You don't have to be hard working. You don't have to be sane.  You just have to be willing to stick your nose where the sun don't shine.  Granted that aint hard because Trump casts a very large shadow.,HumanRuse,2025-05-08T19:47:57,3
