"So of what I can see, in the first 100 days trump has signed at least 142 executive orders and the average is 269 per 4 year term. Biden signed 162 executive orders in a 4 year term (approx 1460 days). Completely insane wielding of power.",CryptographerCrazy49,2025-05-01T06:10:18,27
They want a police state🤷‍♂️,Cha0s4201,2025-05-01T06:26:43,18
The military has no business policing on domestic ground. Trump is laying the groundwork for a full fascist takeover by force before the next election. This should scare the hell out of everyone.,Sojum,2025-05-01T06:23:02,15
"Making the cops only purpose to terrorize and attack your own citizens is a great way to make everyone fight like their life depends on it with any interaction with law enforcement. Something tells me law enforcement doesn't want that considering there's a lot more of us than them, and their names and addresses are easily found.",Bad_Habit_Nun,2025-05-01T06:37:28,5
“Unleash” is a really fucked up word in this context.  Another move entirely compatible with cloaking Jan 6 insurrectionists in victimhood and pardons. It’s all in the skin color and sycophancy,PersonToPerson,2025-05-01T06:13:00,4
"And the military-use scope is for ""crimes"" - in other words, what he wants to be interpreted as crimes. In other words, the intent is not merely flagrantly breaking Posse Comitatus, but a police-military state as an option on the table... against what the founders intended.",steve_ample,2025-05-01T06:19:27,3

"Posse Comma Tatus(spelling) prohibits the military from policing the citizens; unless it is state National Guard at the direction of the Gov. but they’re not following any rules, so this info is mute.",animalslover4569,2025-05-01T06:42:48,9
