"I never thought the courts could be *this slow*   So I read the original ABC article Fox is referencing, which has way more facts.    >The class action case from 2019 was filed on behalf of individuals who entered the U.S. as unaccompanied minors and later sought asylum.   So this person came here illegally, but was a minor when it happened.  Then they applied for asylum in 2019, and DHS and this group entered a settlement contract, saying they won't be deported until their asylum claim was heard.  **6 years later**, that claim has apparently still not been heard.    Now the Trump admin said, at some point, that this person was convicted of felony possession of cocaine in Texas court In January, which removes the settlement protection against deportation, and makes him eligible under the Alien Enemies act to be deported.  This judge is saying no, that's not enough to invalidate this settlement, so the admin is in breach of contract.  It's not clear if the admin is using this drug case as post-hoc justification since they got 'caught,' or if this was reviewed ahead of time and they chose to move forward   I was pre-law in college, yet I'm still flabbergasted by the 1) the legal opinions flying around, and 2) how slow these courts are.  This settlement thing happened under Trump, so why couldn't they just join an asylum determination while they were already in immigration court?  Why'd it have to get pushed off for years?",JerseyKeebs,2025-04-24T17:35:46,139
I don't understand their thinking behind all of this.,Wide_Fig3130,2025-04-24T16:18:04,24
"How much cocaine did this guy have on him?  If it met ""intent to distribute"" levels, he'd already violated his asylum status and could be deported.  No need for the Alien Enemies Act.",LK_Feral,2025-04-29T17:54:32,2

> Why'd it have to get pushed off for years?  The entire plan has been to allow illegal immigration to overwhelm the courts. Why are you pretending this isn't a fact?,FourtyMichaelMichael,2025-04-24T20:54:15,40
"The thinking is really simple: the powers that be want mass migration, so the entire system is deliberately slow-walking every step of the process to create a fait accompli. Everything is geared toward making it easy for migrants to come to the United States, but making it hard on the US to get rid of them again.    Principled judges have to make rulings within the guidelines of the legal framework in place, so you will occasionally see conservative or even Trump-appointed judges make rulings in favor of the migrant in cases like this.",Black_XistenZ,2025-04-24T19:56:43,32
