"Booker and Jeffries, the perfect example of the neoliberal corporate-approved ""let's not talk about oligarchy"" do nothing Democratic party, are outside sitting on the Capitol steps. Nothing could be more symbolic of how useless these guys are.  Remember what a real sit-down strike is. It originated in 1937 Flint Michigan auto plants. Workers sat down at their work stations so that their bosses couldn't bring in replacement workers to take their jobs. Workers took control of the factories and shut it down. That's what a sit-down strike does.  Remember what a real sit-in is? Local black students went to a segregated Woolworths lunch counter and occupied the stools so no one else could take them. They were humiliated, had food poured over them, beaten, dragged away and others took their place. That's what a real sit-in does.   Cory Booker and Hakeem Jeffries are minstrel show wannabees, AIPAC darlings, recipients of lotsa money from Big Pharma, favorable attention from the oligarchic mullahs that ensure we won't have Medicare for All, housing for poor people, jobs for everyone, free university education . . . the basic necessities of life that every other civilized industrialized nation provides for its people.   But the feckless Democratic party, sitting on the steps, will demand our vote in the midterms because ""It's us or the fascists!""",Marxian_factotum,2025-04-27T19:55:33,5
"The DEMS will vote for this budget, regardless how horrible it is. Hear me out....  Sure, the GOP wants to pass this budget via reconciliation, but that likely won't work. So they will need DEM votes for a regular order vote.  MAGA Mike played the $ conservatives brilliantly.... he convinced them to go along with vague promises that the Senate will also institute deep cuts (House: 1.5T, Senate 4B) and they relented.  The final budget will no-way-never have anywhere near the 1.5T in cuts, so the House will balk and some GOP senators as well which will prevent it being passed via reconcilliation and it will go to regular order.  This is where the weak DEMS come in... they will be asked to provide the votes so the $ conservatives can vote their conscious while the DEMS will make sure it passes.  You see, not passing this budget, especially raising the debt limit part will literally blow up the entire economy and they are too weak to stomach that. Mike-DEMS 1:0.  Summary: Dems are weak and will vote for this budget.",tommyjaspers,2025-04-27T17:43:05,3

"Do any of these things fit your demand for a perfect response?  IF not, then tell us what *you* are doing if you can.  * holding townhalls in their own and red districts and states * holding nominees up in committee * blocking votes in the House (and all but 1 in the Senate) * organizing and attending multiple protests which have brought millions of people out * have helped with over 200 lawsuits against Trump, most of which they've won/winning * won most special elections so far * speaking up on the floor of Congress so information is entered into the official record, including a 25 hour speech * are busy doing media appearances to help inform and educate people * going to El Salvador to try and bring Garcia and the other 250+ prisoners home * going to the immigration camps in Louisiana to check on prisoners and work to get them released",atreeismissing,2025-04-28T00:29:37,3
Ok so what's your plan to stop the Trump agenda?,Simpletruth2022,2025-04-27T20:04:38,3
Fuck off worthless Marxist. Quit acting like you do anything besides lay in mommy’s basement. Also jobs for everyone? No other western country has anything like that.,MelodicFlight3030,2025-04-28T00:59:42,2
No they won’t. All Democrats voted against the Trump tax cuts in 2017 and all will vote against them again in 2025.,MelodicFlight3030,2025-04-28T01:01:17,2
Of course they will because you have to fund the govt otherwise 10s of millions of people will suffer even more than they are now.  But what you can do is protest cuts to medicare which is what they're doing.,atreeismissing,2025-04-28T00:30:28,1
"How about a positive endorsement of the better candidate running to unseat Booker?  .. .. ..  ""Vote him out"" is a poor message when he has no strong primary challenger.  ""Let's get a primary challenge going"" is a better message. Absent of that, ""vote him out"" means ""vote a Republican in"" instead. (Note, there also aren't any Republican candidates just yet, so it's all academic at the moment.)",enjoycarrots,2025-04-27T19:43:12,8

"My wife was going crazy as a huge politics fan. I only knew the names of my own congress people. Coons, Blunt-Rochester, and McBride all showed up at various times.   I watched as a representative from Maryland spoke, but I don’t have the name.   Also had a lot of faith leaders speak.",Revolutionary-Boss64,2025-04-28T05:03:14,1
"Thanks.  I'm shocked Chris Coons showed up for anything.  I looked at the live feed periodically but generally couldn't keep up.  Media cover seems to be minimal, but I overall support the sentiment.   It would have been nice to see more congressfolks show up.",BeeSuspicious3493,2025-04-29T03:31:07,1
