"I’ve noticed that there’s Pro-Palestine protests and Pro-Palestinian protests.  Originally I took them to be the same but you can support and advocate for the welfare of palestinian people but still be against the establishment of a Palestine state.  Anarchists and humanitarian mentalities would fit in here.  And naturally you can support the creation of a state of Palestine without necessarily prioritizing the welfare and human rights of the people though this would seem rare in the west and more of a Hamas or jihad mentality.   All that said, it’s outrageous that police would raid pro-Palestinian targets over Pro-Palestine targets.  It’s dark and dystopian.",dbag3o1,2025-04-25T14:37:36,-2

"Just happy I am not being down voted into the oblivion with comments like ""Get that anti American sentiment out of here"" or something. It's messed up but we all knew it was coming and these people chose what they considered was the moral high ground even though Biden and Harris were much better for Palestinians considering they were actively working on a peace deal just treading lightly.",noforgayjesus,2025-04-25T17:39:04,1
