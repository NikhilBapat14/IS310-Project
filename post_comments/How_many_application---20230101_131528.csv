"Most likely you wonâ€™t even get a call back for a majority of the internships, apply to as many as you think you qualify for.",HiggetyFlough,2023-01-03T19:13:13,2
"Three, one to your member in the House and one to each of your Senators.  *In general* members will never hire someone from outside their district/state if they can hire someone from inside their district/state, so this is by far your best bet.  Along that, if you have any particular interest or background in the work of a relevant committee *that one of your members/Senators is on*, you can apply to the committee if it offers an internship.  Again, if you're a California resident, there is, in my humble opinion, little point to applying an internships with the office of a New York Senator.",digbyforever,2023-01-04T04:41:14,2
