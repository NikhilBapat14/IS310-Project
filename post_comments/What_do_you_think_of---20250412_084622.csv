"Bad idea. If person X knows they will rotate to a new government, they will set it up to fail so their new ruling body can take advantage. It will only hurt the people.",IGotSkills,2025-04-12T20:04:44,7
"This presupposes that any given political party is unable to hit 50% + 1 of the voting share, though, right?  Otherwise, why would an outright majority party need to swap leadership with lesser party coalition partners?",digbyforever,2025-04-12T09:33:59,9
"It feels kinda weird, if you have let's a far left to social democrat coalition the most extreme members would never accept to spend half of their term voting for the law they don't want because they pledge to support the coalition. Also they would have no guarantee that in the middle of the term the other coalition member won't break the pact   It makes way more sense to find a middle ground with a program and a candidate that all the coalition would support.",Mofane,2025-04-12T10:50:31,2

">Fianna Fail and Fine Gael  Who are essentially the same party (each representing one side of the Irish Civil War), backed into a corner by a rampant opposition. It's not really a democratic move.  Fianna Fáil (""Warriors of Destiny"") represents the ""irregulars"", the original Republicans/IRA of the 1920s.   Fine Gael (""Family/Tribe of the Irish"") represents the winning side ""Free Staters"", the government of Ireland during the Civil War.   Sinn Féin (""We Ourselves"") represents the redux Republicans/IRA of the 1960s to 1990s.  Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have increasingly minor differences, little more than accents on policy in the face of Sinn Féin who they both hate with a passion.",epsilona01,2025-04-12T10:00:57,2

"I generally think it’s fine, in a multiparty democracy the voter always knows their preferred party could end up as either a junior or senior coalition partner, and rotation is essentially both sequentially.  It’s probably not advisable if it ends like experiments both Spain (“Turno Pacífico”) and Colombia (“Frente Nacional”) attempted at different points of the 20th Century. In both examples, they essentially gave up on democracy, and had the government that would form after each election essentially pre-determined, alternating between two vaguely classically liberal parties.",DynaMenace,2025-04-12T18:55:02,1

"I get what you mean by this, but a government is an institutional body that can't tolerate 2 visions at the same time.  One party has to rule, make decisions, take responsibility and establish order and the other has to criticize, correct and advocate (through parliament, media and civil society). Political stability depends on consistency. When a government adopts a set of paradoxical decisions during its term, it signals political instability and a lack of coherent vision, which undermines its ability to present a clear direction to the public.  Sharing legislative power can be done through MP representation, but sharing executive power is a double-edged sword, especially if the political platform is extremely polarized.",RikoTheSeeker,2025-04-12T10:51:01,-1

"This is just a dumb hypothetical, but nah, the Nazis wouldn't get a turn because none of the mainstream parties wanted anything to do with them. But if you had a rotating government, *maybe* you could have avoided the shitshow that was the Bruning Cabinet that made the Depression that much worse by doing absolutely nothing. And *maybe* that wouldn't have resulted in an exodus of voters to the Nazis and the KPD that buried German democracy and guaranteed Hitler's rise to power.  Big maybes, but literally anyone other than Bruning being in charge from '28 onwards (except for Hitler, of course) would have been better off for Germany.",AT_Dande,2025-04-12T15:12:17,2
How on Earth did you manage to come up with an example this unhelpful? A criminal action is still their responsibility regardless of when it happens. Same with political responsibility.   And the parties need to be able to agree on the idea of a coalition government in the first place.,Awesomeuser90,2025-04-12T21:43:53,1

"I don't think that you quite understand an important feature. This is a parliamentary system. The other person is still part of the executive, probably as the deputy prime minister while waiting their turn or having already served their term. The departments are headed by ministers which are also split by party.  Say that there are 16 ministers and one party has 35% of the seats in parliament and the other party has 25%, then the first party has 9 ministers and the other party has 7. The ministers as a collective decide policy and they are collectively responsible for their decisions. It is them as a whole that makes most decisions other than those specific to within a department. Stuff like adopting a regulation where a law says that they can do so, proposing bills to parliament, advising the king or president to dissolve parliament, stuff like that.",Awesomeuser90,2025-04-14T03:50:22,1
"In a place like this, the executive power would be based on the two parties in general, each of which supplies Ministers anyway and in law, the prime minister is just the chairperson of all the ministers.",Awesomeuser90,2025-04-12T11:02:24,2

"That really wasn't the main point of my argument and I don't want to discuss about how much can you write in the law that a party, once it signed a contract, is forced to follow the vote of his coalition because that's the exact opposite of democracy.

"I thought of the worst governments in the past hundred years or so, and considered what it would be like if we just gave them power, instead of what actually happened.  It seemed pretty silly, to me.

"let's simplify things here: Each party may have different ideas and goals, so when leadership changes, the plans and policies might change too. This can make it hard to follow a clear path for the country’s future. People may get confused about what the government really wants to do, and important projects might slow down or stop.

"It's a rotating government between the ruling parties, not *all* parties. So yes, if the others could get a majority, they'd agree to rotate the role of Chancellor and/or other ministerial posts between them. Like, if you had something like this in today's Germany, you'd get two years of Merz, and then two years of Scholz again, because the CDU and SPD are the only two parties making up the government coalition.

"The AfD got only a fifth of the votes. 80% of German voters did not vote for them. Even if they came in first with 40% of the votes, 60% of German voters did not vote for them and if the others who got votes agree to not work with the AfD, the latter has no right to rule the country. This is completely normal around the world. In New Zealand in 2017, National had the most votes at just under 45% of all votes but Labour, NZ 1st, and the Greens cumulatively had 50.4% of the votes and were able to agree on a common platform for governing and so they created the government and not National.",Awesomeuser90,2025-04-12T21:49:47,1
"How is citing an attempted coup not a loophole? If anything Hitler was, by Weimar's laws back then, supposed to have been imprisoned for life.

I'm just trying to understand, how the other parties get to freeze them out, and what the parameters of that are.  How does AfD win, if only to illustrate for me how unlikely that is?  edit: is there a way, perhaps with the creation of ersatz AfD friendly parties, that AfD could find itself in the position to freeze out the parties that freeze AfD out now?",Tired8281,2025-04-12T22:05:40,0
"It only works if the other parties are unwilling to work with them. If the AfD was an organization with values that actually respected human dignity, the value of democracy, and equality of people of all without discrimination, not being an extremist organization, the other parties would be willing to work with them.   I will add that no party in Germany in an election with legal opposition has ever had a majority of the votes before. Genuinely. The first German election was in 1848. The chance of one single party having a majority of the seats in Parliament would be very low.   Do you understand the idea of parliamentary systems and proportional electoral systems?",Awesomeuser90,2025-04-12T22:18:27,1
"Yes, that's generally how parliamentary democracy works. If you can gather a coalition with a majority of the seats, you get (to share) all the power while those not in the coalition get no power. This is the case in Germany, the UK, the USs and pretty much every other democracy.",rabbitlion,2025-04-13T02:32:38,1

They are very common in many other parts of the world, and you're very lucky that you haven't had to deal with them lately.  So, what happens, if AfD creates a number of puppet parties, and manages to get 50.1+% in combination with them?  Would they then be able to freeze out the rest?",Tired8281,2025-04-12T22:29:33,1
"We're not talking about parliamentary democracy, my friend.  We're talking about this ridiculous give turns to everybody government.",Tired8281,2025-04-13T08:42:26,0
"How are they getting puppet parties started? Here is the German law for the relevant provisions: [https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/partg/BJNR007730967.html](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/partg/BJNR007730967.html) and [https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bwahlg/\_\_20.html](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bwahlg/__20.html)  According to this, you need a certain number of people to sign a paper telling the electoral returning officer's department that they support seeing someone on the ballot paper. You are looking at many thousands of people doing this concert, and if something looks fishy then the returning officer is going to order an investigation and if something looks like fraud, they aren't going to allow that.   Also, the people have to vote for these puppet parties which you seem to have a strange obsession with here. In Germany, you need at least 5% of the vote or to win three constituencies directly to get a seat in parliament (other countries have ideas like that in other ways, Sweden is at 4%, Denmark at 2%), and it would be rather challenging to get a bunch of votes distributed to these other parties. In the end, if these parties are going to get a majority of seats, they need about a majority of people to vote for them, and the turnout is high at between 75 and 80 percent.  Parties themselves in a place like Germany also have to adopt a lot of paperwork, financial data, and show that they are serious, not controlled by outside groups, have internally democratic structures, a sense of themselves, stuff like that to be even able to exist as a legal organization. Germans are pretty used to seeing new parties, especially at the local and state level, and smelling a rat is more obvious when a party can't explain how it came to be, what their policies are, where their money is, and what they are doing.   If somehow the AfD did get power, there is still a lot to be done. The president is not going to sign bills into law if they think they go against the constitution and can get a court in Germany, the constitutional court, to weigh in on that decision and that court has been consistently willing to void anything that goes against basic human rights or the institutionalized protection of democracy in all walks of life like the civil service and the military. The intelligence agencies, police, judges, prosecutors, are not unthinking tools of ministers, neither are civil servants or teachers. And most of the government's employees and agencies in Germany are protected by labour agreements, laws providing protection for their political neutrality and competence, and it is extremely difficult to carry out anything like a purge. Most of these employees and even most judges, prosecutors, and police for that matter are state level employees, not federal ones, and the states have a lot of autonomy. The Bundesrat represents state governments and has a lot of sway in federal legislation. And the opposition parties in both houses of parliament and in all sixteen state parliaments are also well equipped to prevent anti democratic action like incredibly strong rights to compel evidence and testimony and to inquire about what is going on. The power of pardon is very weak in Germany, nothing like the way it works in America.  Add in how the European Union has tools of their own as well to enforce compliance with basic democratic norms and opposition to corruption and maintaining the rule of law, which the AfD would be certainly trying to go against.",Awesomeuser90,2025-04-13T02:19:33,1
If that was the impression you got I can see your confusion but it seems you have misunderstood the concept.  What we are talking about is a parliamentary democracy where a coalition of multiple parties hold the majority and where they rotate the position of prime minister rather than just have the largest party hold it (or however else it's decided).,rabbitlion,2025-04-13T09:05:58,1
