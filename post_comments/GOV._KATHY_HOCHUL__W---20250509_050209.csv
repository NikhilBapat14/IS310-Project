"No fan of Hochul, but it's a good idea. She may end up saving more than just education. Less time on their phones means these kids will have more time to interact with each other as human beings. Lo and behold, they may actually end up developing social skills.",Vessarionovich,2025-05-09T05:34:04,139
"I have a friend who teaches high school math in one of the 5 boroughs. Y’all- most of us (myself included really) have no idea just how bad it is out there. Very few of the kids he teaches are anywhere near the level they should be. They are disrespectful, belligerent, and extremely quick to anger and violence- in a CLASSROOM!!! The parents are equally as belligerent and angry and rude if they’re there at all.  Trust that school is nothing like it was for us millennials. Boomers won’t even be able to wrap their minds around the level of down slide. What I mean is- I actually agree with this. Every state should be on board.",Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-05-09T05:59:08,166
"Credit where credit is due. It blows my mind that more states haven't done this already, anyone with half a brain should know that it's virtually impossible to teach anything when kids have their phones on them all day. Hell, it's hard enough to get a room full of adults to pay attention these days. Let alone 9 year olds.",hannelorelynn,2025-05-09T06:02:54,49
"Kathy Hockul sucks major ass, for sure! I should know - she’s my governor, unfortunately. Never voted for her and never will vote Democrat EVER.  But on this one specific issue, she’s totally right. Phones are terrible for kids.   I’ll take it one step further: phones aren’t good all the time for ANY of us, including adults! I use it while eating breakfast and all day long, but by dinner I not only put it away but shut it off till tomorrow morning. It’s not even in the bedroom. It works for me. Just because we have access to them 24/7 doesn’t mean we need to.",142Ironmanagain,2025-05-09T08:16:15,21
"Good. Phones have totally screwed everything up when it comes to kids. Using them copioiusly during school, watching endless hours of brain rot Youtube slop, discovering and getting hooked on porn, parents just allowing them to use it in any social setting as a babysitter; there's practically nothing positive whatsoever that comes from kids  having phones until they need them for practical reasons to communicate when they can start driving and going out without parents.",Chapped_Assets,2025-05-09T09:17:51,7
"As much as I hate my governor Kathy Hochul, this is a good idea.  Kids are smart though.  Many of them will likely just get a cheap android tracphone to hand over if they get caught.  A lot of them will continue to use their phones in school. Additionally some students have to have their phones on them as part of their IEP. For example my kids wear hearing aids and they need their phones on them at all times to adjust the settings for different loud/quiet environments like going from study hall to gym class.",__rhino___,2025-05-09T11:24:00,3

"Now get Woke out of the classroom.  It's not a bad thing to eliminate phones, but it's like repairing the fence gate first after an F5 tornado levels your property",r_barchetta,2025-05-10T07:30:24,1
"It's not about saving education.  It's about saving face.  Instead of admitting that the teachers care more about pushing liberal ideology, having non-American flags in their classes, and maintaining the lie that they are underpaid than actually educating the children, they can just blame the phones, which, by extension, is blaming the kids.",Lord_Elsydeon,2025-05-09T06:13:10,-26
"A stupid law. It will immediately be labeled as ""racist"". Any teacher that tries to enforce it will be in danger. They are basically creating laws that only are applied to ""good"" kids. If you really want to do this, block the signals.",AppState1981,2025-05-09T06:45:07,-14

"Just want to throw some context out into the ether here. I’m 26 and when I was in highschool there was a lot leeway given to people who were close to graduating. Some of these people should have never graduated to the point where I think it’s so questionable it’s hilarious in a sad way.   My group of Gen z was basically told by teachers you can have your phone on you but not out unless for a specific reason.   I went to school in Massachusetts with like 3500 other kids or something. Big highschool. The lowest level we for had classes was called college, then honors, followed by High Honors classes and sometimes AP classes. The difference in attitudes between the lowest level classes students and higher levels was stark to say the least.   Teachers who taught honors or high level courses mostly were the happiest because they had students who cared about school and at least gave a little bit of a shit and tried for the most part.",Derp2638,2025-05-09T06:17:36,50
"Removing the phones is good. Removing perpetual problem students via real discipline is better. I taught high school from 2015-2017 in the district I grew up in, and it was unbelievable what students got away with. Essentially unless the police took the kids to jail, the absolute most “discipline” they would receive was a day or 2 of suspension, but we still had to allow them to make up the work (they never did, of course). Kids assaulting each other, assaulting teachers, threatening them, cursing them out and storming off, or just fucking off and being disruptions all day were the norm. If the kid has an IEP or some kind of “accommodation,” they’re untouchable and they know it and their parents know it.   My wife taught elementary school up until Covid and it is even bad there. Everyone I know who still teaches says it only got exponentially worse after Covid. Now that I have my own kids and a different career, my wife and I decided we will happily spend every dollar we make on private school to keep our kids out of that.",smp501,2025-05-09T14:04:16,5
Two root evils: public schooling and uncaring/disconnected parents.  One can argue the former leads to the latter as people who arent directly paying for something tend to not care about it as well as the inability to pull funding (enrollment) from schools as leverage for change .  Until they change the only thing to be done is polish the turd.,codifier,2025-05-09T08:20:35,5
"At the end of the day it doesn't matter why they're doing it, it's the results that matter. Obviously teachers pushing politics on kids isn't good, but keeping kids off their phones why they're at school needs to happen regardless of other issues that need to be addressed. Gotta start somewhere.",Spartanlegion117,2025-05-09T06:58:47,19
"Would you feel differently if it was a [republican governor](https://www.doe.virginia.gov/programs-services/school-operations-support-services/cell-phone-free-education-in-virginia-k-12-public-schools) who did the same thing?   Getting phones out of classrooms isn't a partisan issue. It has overwhelming support from parents, teachers, and both of the major political parties.",Quirky-Marsupial-420,2025-05-09T07:58:22,15
