Many retailers are taking advantage of the tariffs and are  using them as an excuse to raise prices.,Blown89,2025-05-09T01:44:59,48
"Putting aside that this would never pass, it‚Äôd actually be a hilarious backfire for businesses to expose how little they pay for cheap imports.  If a toy from China sells for $20 and has a $2.90 tariff increase listed, customers would immediately know the importer only paid $2 for the toy and $2.90 is the 145% tariff. Businesses would rather eat the tariff cost than expose what the margin is.",dunkeater,2025-05-08T17:50:06,177
"It's truly amazing how they are able to somehow understand basics of the concept of regulations and taxes adding to the costs of products and services, but only for tariffs and literally nothing else.",Yoinkitron5000,2025-05-08T16:20:27,54
"Can we add all the cost increases from hyper ""everything needs to go green"" measures too? How about the impact of all the foreign tariffs on the production chain before it gets to us?    Better yet, how about how much of the costs are from taxes used for all the worthless government pet projects the Dems are so fond of starting?",Zerogates,2025-05-08T16:55:26,22
"I would rather they didn't but while we are at it, how about minimum wage cost, gas price cost, the supply chain cost from basic material to finished product.  Regulation cost. Why stop at tariffs?",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-08T17:04:50,25
Soon they are going to be requires to give you a P&L with your purchases. This is ridiculous.¬†,Blahblahnownow,2025-05-09T09:53:33,2
"""Be careful what you wish for, you just might get it.""  Businesses would then start posting how much taxation, regulation, over-priced labor, and other Democrat agenda items are raising prices.",Lord_Elsydeon,2025-05-09T08:31:01,3
While Biden was president we should have had a second price tag under the real one showing how much it cost last year.,Hot-Syrup-5833,2025-05-08T17:50:50,-12
These same people throw fits when restaurants itemize surcharges for State mandates like healthcare and family leave that cause payroll increases..,Q_me_in,2025-05-08T19:15:19,-4
Yup. And my company is using it as a go ahead for layoffs.,ManufacturerFine2454,2025-05-10T13:35:12,1

Are you telling me the plastic toy I got from dollar tree that smells like gasoline doesn't actually cost 1.25?,ManufacturerFine2454,2025-05-10T13:52:36,2
"I mean. We see something similar in CA. And it was consumers going after oil/gas companies that caused them to list breakdowns at the pump.   But, yeah I doubt we would see it with many cheap china crap. But, is not impossible with more high quality, and expensive imports.",thatfordboy429,2025-05-09T21:38:08,1
"Yeah I think it's a great idea let's add the cost of tariffs and the cost of taxation.   At the end of the day consumers pay all the taxes on the cost to get products on the shelves. For example a vegetable includes the cost of property tax and equipment, the seeds, the labor, the water, the fuel, The transportation, the packaging, the labor for all these processes and finally sales tax.   Show the American people exactly what they're paying for.",fordr015,2025-05-08T16:34:33,83
"This is a very good pragmatic, and objective assessment.  Shelf price tags aren‚Äôt free, many-many retailers have one price tag, with one format, they print and then ship all around the country, or they‚Äôre printed in store. This would collectively be a massive expense, one more cut in the left‚Äôs ‚Äúwe haven‚Äôt met red tape we don‚Äôt like‚Äù death by 1,000 cuts.  Those that use e-ink often have one template they use in hundreds of stores, a re-design isn‚Äôt the trivial nothing burger the left might think.   So to make a political statement, they literally want businesses to spend a lot of time, effort, and cold hard cash.  Doesn‚Äôt matter really anyway, because it won‚Äôt happen.   Trump and the right are working to streamline, red tape, not add to it.  This is just a virtue signaling bill with zero chance of happening.",cliffotn,2025-05-08T16:30:21,-12
