Perfect timing.  Market was taking another dump so it was time to put out another meaningless statement to prop it up,quest814,2025-04-23T10:03:58,5
President Trump has shown that any deals he makes are worthless - USMCA treaty comes to mind immediately.  I suspect the next 3.5 years are going to be very rough for the good ol US of A.,MariosBrother1,2025-04-23T10:26:41,3
"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Wednesday said that “there is an opportunity for a big deal here” on trade issues between the United States and China.  “If they want to rebalance, let’s do it together,” Bessent said during an appearance at the Institute of International Trade and Finance in Washington, D.C.  But Bessent, in an address to the group, also called out the World Bank for lending to nations that have advanced economic growth, including China.  He suggested the bank stop lending to China.

In which case China should reject it and absolutely take the USA for everything it has in a way worse trade deal for the USA and a much better one for China.  China is clearly winning here so they should use the leverage they have now and really twist the knife on the USA properly.,smp7401,2025-04-23T13:53:31,1
