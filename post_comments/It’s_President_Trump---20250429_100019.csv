"Why did so many journalist engage in sanewashing Trump?   Biden was repeatedly criticised by the media for his apparent cognitive decline.  Trump literally sounds insane when he speaks and makes no sense.  Why has he not been covered the same?  Why aren't concerns about Trump's own cognitive abilities regularly discussed by the media?     Trump regularly claims he ""knows nothing"" about critical things going on in his administration - why is he not pressed on his ignorance?   He's claimed he wasn't aware the supreme court ruled 9-0 against his deportation of Garcia.   He claimed he wasn't aware of the US service members who died on exercise in Lithuania.   He claimed he knew nothing about the signal chat scandal after it broke.",WaffleBlues,2025-04-29T10:15:30,719
"Why does media willingly participate in the [firehose of falsehood](https://www.rand.org/pubs/perspectives/PE198.html), acting as amplifiers for disinformation? I mean things like the the ""\[Someone\] says \[wild unsupported claims\]"" style of articles that do little but put lies in front of millions, and feed into their spread and acceptance by familiarizing the public with them?  For further context, quoting from the linked article:  The experimental psychology literature tells us that first impressions are very resilient: An individual is more likely to accept the first information received on a topic and then favor this information when faced with conflicting messages. Furthermore, repetition leads to familiarity, and familiarity leads to acceptance:  * Repeated exposure to a statement has been shown to increase its acceptance as true. * The “illusory truth effect” is well documented, whereby people rate statements as more truthful, valid, and believable when they have encountered those statements previously than when they are new statements. * When people are less interested in a topic, they are more likely to accept familiarity brought about by repetition as an indicator that the information (repeated to the point of familiarity) is correct. * When processing information, consumers may save time and energy by using a frequency heuristic, that is, favoring information they have heard more frequently. * Even with preposterous stories and urban legends, those who have heard them multiple times are more likely to believe that they are true. * If an individual is already familiar with an argument or claim (has seen it before, for example), they process it less carefully, often failing to discriminate weak arguments from strong arguments.",Konukaame,2025-04-29T11:01:47,114

"Thanks for doing the AMA. Can all of you acknowledge that the information coming from the white house is following a structured release in the vain of Steve Bannons “flood the zone” strategy. They will release information, then dodge questions and accountability on any question asked about that information. I wouldn’t presume to know how media and reporters should handle this, but from the outside looking in it feels like every single reporter is chasing their own stories and all they need to put off the trail is for the administration to fire hose out a hundred issues and then the administration moves on.  Each individual reporter gets something they can write a story about, the administration dodges tough questions and gets to look competent and the American people are left wondering what in the world is going on. From the outside looking in it appears that a change of strategy is necessary, what are your thoughts on potential options (should we even change strategy)? Should things stay the same as they are now? What would you do to change the flow of the conversations with the White House?  Just to clarify, this is mainly focused on press interactions with the white house or president. Overall I think media organizations are doing a good job of following all the disparate threads they are left, outside of talking with the white house.",Most_Thing8104,2025-04-29T10:18:59,252

"Two questions. 1) Why has no one done a comprehensive review comparing the movements of the first 100 days and telegraphing of intentions to Project 2025 section-by-section? 2) Why has no one done a comprehensive look at the present and future likelihood of discrimination (workplace, housing, education, banking/lending etc.) that has been de-emphasized at DOJ in favor of comparatively tangential pursuits of trans rights and antisemitism that occur much less frequently and affect significantly fewer of the American population?

Can you give us a single example of another country paying a tariff on a good or part imported by an American company?""  3 If Trump or a republican politician doesn't answer a question satisfactorily, or obfuscates, or lies, why doesn't the next journalist up ask the same question/ask for clarification/point out the misinformation?",ElPlywood,2025-04-29T10:14:12,100

"The mass erosion of faith (confidence?) in journalism has unfortunately coincided with both an era of disinformation and an increasing reliance on paywalling.  The paywalling of the article where Jeffrey Goldberg released the Signal messages struck me as a particularly dystopian example of how paywalls can allow misinformation to spread, even when facts are readily available.

The changes have been particularly drastic with respect to tariffs, dismantling or extensive restructuring of well-established federal agencies and immigration impacting the world at large.   My questions are \[1\] Whether President Trump's actions will ultimately impact the American soft power abroad and the long-term consequences these may have in diminishing our influence.   \[2\] The second questions is about the extent of his Executive Orders which some consider Executive overreach. The implementation of Aliens Enemies Act and Brith right Citizenship.

"How likely do you think it is that Trump is taking orders from Russia, either through coercion or blackmail?  edit for extra context:   The actions Trump has taken seem so targeted at hurting the US both economically and reputationally, that it is difficult to believe that he has done these things with the intention of improving the country or it's standing in the world. Over the course of a few weeks he has taken the States from a position of control and trust amongst its allies, to one of absolute distrust and disdain. Over the next 2-3 years the cost to the States will almost certainly equate to trillions of dollars via lost tourism, lost defence sales and self inflicted financial harm.  To me it seems such self inflicted wounds could only be done at the behest of a hostile state which has power over the person in charge. It could be manipulation, bribes or blackmail; or a combination of them all. I wouldn't be surprised if years from now, it comes out that Russia holds sway over Trump via embarrassing bedroom videos or other financial strings.",imashination,2025-04-29T10:10:47,52

"Do you think some reporters that deal directly with the President have any explicit or implicit bias in how they speak to the president knowing both his tendency to clam up/ lash out when faced with overly confrontational questions? This goes along with the fact that critical reporting has led to less access for the news agencies that engage in it.   If I was a white house reporter and I noticed I got worse responses or got called on less often when I was too aggressive with my phrasing, that I would naturally want to change my strategy to get better play for my stories. Do you think this is something that the president and the Whitehouse encourage to get softer questions from when otherwise critical news sources?  More broadly, do you think the career and profit incentives built into corporate media truly makes you the best agents for the people when it comes to speaking truth to power? It's not enough to say the system works the best it can without admitting that there are institutional failings inherent in corporate media that make it fundamentally incapable of faithfully serving the public at all times.",seansman15,2025-04-29T12:04:43,5

Is there a real possibility that Trump will be impeached? His policies have been Hurting the Republican senators just as much as the Democratic ones as far as I can see.   3. Do you believe that the United States can find a way out of this Crisis? As a European it is pretty disheartening to see how the United States throwing away Their democracy and separation of Power. Do you believe there will be a way for the us and their relationship with allies to return to a pre Trump 2.0 State? Or do you think he has changed trade and the Soft Power of the US forever?   4. Any Idea why Trump is so hell bent on helping Israel? To me it is not very clear what he would gain from it, and while the Us have helped Israel a lot it seems like he is ready to do about anything to help Israel.   5. last Question, who directs most of what is happening in the administration currently? I think there was this WSJ Story a week ago where it was described how scott bessent(?) had to meet Trump and convince him of the tarif pause, and make sure Trump doesnt meet navarro and so on before announcing the pause. Do you believe that Trump harbors all this hate inside of him for other countries? Do you think he honestly feels like the US are being taken advantage of by all the other countries? I always thought he was just trying to become ritcher, but i never thought he would crash the economy for that.

"Hi, I'm from Vietnam and I have 2 questions. 1. During the rush at the end of last year to appoint as much federal judges as possible, Democrats struck a deal with Republicans to remove procedural roadblock to be able to fill most of the vacant district court positions in exchange for not filling 4 circuits courts positions. Do you think this was a strategy premeditated by Democrats aiming to maximize the odds of getting favorable TRO and preliminary injuction against the Trump administration at the district level; and if you think this was indeed their thinking do you think this was a good strategy considering 4 circuit positions is quite a lot a that time (even though it later dropped to 3 or 2 after some judges withdraw their senior status, I'm not sure about this). 2. So far the Trump administration hasn't nominated any new judges for the currently vacant positions, why is this the case? Also do you think there is a high chance that Democrats can somehow retake the Senate next year to block Trump effort to continue filling the federal bench with possibly even more partisan judges than his first term?",Future_Celery194,2025-04-29T12:02:42,2

"Thanks for the AMA,  Why do you think reporters, whether to the White House or parts of the administration start a conversation but it never has a follow up.  For example, the question might be to the administration, ""What are you doing about Kilmer Abrego Garcia to get him back per the judges orders""  Their response is, ""Nothing, he is illegal immigrant""  The conservation seems to stop there, but really you could ask and followup, ""Yes was originally labelled illegal I believe and then judges said he is allowed to stay in the country at judges order.  He is NOT a part of MS13.  Not charged with a crime, what say you?""  On the female Tuft student.   The State Department said it is their discretion to revoke a visa.  It is a privilege to stay here.    The followup to that, ""What criteria is being use to revoke visas from students.  It seems to be arbitrary and the students 1st amendent rights are being violated. ""  When Sen. Van Hollen went to El Salvador, they brought up Laken Riley.  That seems to conflate two issues.  Kilmer had nothing to do with MS13, or murder or her murder.  Sen. Van Hollen went there to ensure due process was followed.   This was never brought up to the administration, what is their response on due process.  See things brought up but really challenged.

My particular topic is regarding our administration’s approach to the autism spectrum and their plans to enact a “registry” and “find a cure” for those assigned with autism at time of birth or soon thereafter. The more research I do into their plans to help aid families with autism, more and more do I see what I fear to be a direct path to eugenics as we saw with Nazi Germany and their attempts to “purify the Aryan race”. They (the administration and in particular RFK Jr.)speak of autism as though it is a curable “disease” even though all studies have pointed to heredity and genetics being the main cause of autism cases. Passing around false rhetoric about the realities of autism not only sets a dangerous precedent for any legislation attempting to be passed to “discover a cure” as we are allocating funds into what is essentially mass exploitation of the marginalized.  My question is this. At what point does our administration need to step in and take action to aid those with autism rather than to isolate them and force them into a whirlwind of political based initiatives and run analysis them using studies with no basis in science of respective studies thereof?",Mother-Dimension-613,2025-04-29T13:19:39,1

"I'm not sure if any of you have read about the story of Mark Lyttle   https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/04/29/the-deportation-machine  But he was an American born man with darker skin who was detained by ICE in 2008 and then deported, meaning he was deported as a US citizen born in America to Mexico. Mark Lyttle has intellectual/learning disabilities that were exploited by ICE and it's bureaucracy and couldn't easily contact his family when he was detained which was part of how an American citizen was able to be deported at all. It's honestly a miracle that he was able to make it back to the US at all, he didn't speak any Spanish and lived as a homeless drifter until he was arrested in Guatemala where they heard him say he was an American and believed him on account of his accent and took him to the US embassy where he was able to make his way back to the US from.    The reason I bring this up is because I keep thinking about how people like Mark Lyttle, people with intellectual/learning disabilities that makes the already hostile bureaucracy of ICE even more difficult, people without strong support systems where they can have family to vouch for them and lawyers to protect them, are also not the kinds of people who can get in touch with the press to cover their story. I keep thinking about how hard it would be for people like this to survive being deported to a country they've never known, how slim of a chance Mark Lyttle's return was, and how it was only upon his return that his story was covered by the press.   A couple days ago I came across [this article](https://newrepublic.com/post/194303/us-citizen-detained-10-days-dhs-lied) about another US born US citizen who was detained by ICE now, who has a learning/intellectual disability that was exploited by ICE. Thankfully his family was able help him, but I keep wondering if we're missing more, that the exact kind of US citizen who could've been deported by ICE since Trump took office, is the exact kind of US citizen who had already fallen through the cracks here in America, and was exactly someone who the press wouldn't know about.   So I guess my question is if this is something that you guys have been thinking about too and been on the lookout for, because I can't shake the feeling that what's exceptional about Mark Lyttle's case isn't that he was an American citizen who was deported, but that he was maybe the only one who found his way back.",Chrome_X_of_Hyrule,2025-04-29T13:24:32,1

I am more on the side of the Peoples Movement with 50501. It took a really long time for the media to start covering any protests against the administration. Literally, the entire world thought a lot of Americans were complicit in all of the Presidents rhetoric on annexation, and deportations, and tariffs and the list goes on. I always was kind of wondering why during the time AP News was kicked out of the Oval Office, how come nobody reported on the opposition? A lot of us were actually screaming in the streets about our entire Constitution being completely just crapped on, but it all fell on deaf ears. Our allies over seas saw this as a betrayal from the American people because for a long time, they didnt see us protesting. A lot of us thought the media was compromised and you guys werent allowed to cover any opposition to the administration. Nobody really covered us until the April 5th “Hands Off” protests, but we were definitely out in the streets long before that.

"Hey, so a bunch of people have posted some version of the above question. Know this might not be satisfying, but, speaking for myself, I disagree with the criticism. The president’s power is not derived from the language mainstream news outlets are using in stories about him. Meanwhile, those same news outlets are in overdrive right now trying to get as much information as possible on the enactment of Trump’s agenda — and as a result, the administration is facing pressure to answer for its actions on tariffs, immigration, the civil service, etc. etc. etc. The “media” — which consists of basically everything under the sun from Fox News to The New York Times to some guy making TikToks — can’t be viewed as a monolith, though.   But let’s highlight [an NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/poll-biden-trump-supporters-sharply-divided-media-consume-rcna149497) survey from last year. It was from when President Joe Biden was still in the race. What was Trump’s strongest group? Voters who didn’t consume political news at all. What were his two weakest groups? People who consume news from newspapers and national networks.  One more thing: There were plenty of people who voted for Trump who simply did not think he would do the things he, and others around him, said he was going to do. I talk to people like this frequently. They saw what was being proposed, what was being reported on, and say a version of “eh, he’s just talking! It’ll be just like his first term pre-Covid. I thought things were better then than they were now.” Even more still voted for him explicitly because of what he was promising.  \- Allan Smith",nbcnews,2025-04-29T15:20:05,-6

"The 2026 midterms will be an interesting test of the US political system after the last couple of elections, where Trump questioned without evidence the legitimacy of the outcomes when he lost and the vote-counting system itself.  Democrats are expected to perform well in the next national campaign (don’t forget Virginia and New Jersey this November!) and we’ve seen early suggestions they may win back the US House. That would be in line with the Republican victories during Democratic presidencies in 1994, 2010 and 2022 and also when Democrats took back the House from Trump in 2018.  Trump has made it clear he’s going to continue to push on election issues. He signed an executive order in March with new voter ID requirements for federal elections – and lawsuits are piling up on that one. We’ll be watching his rhetoric going forward to see what he has to say as president of the United States about the 2026 campaign.  I'd also note that Kamala Harris’ concession speech after her loss to Trump represented an important inflection point on the topic of “free and fair” elections. It was important when you consider Trump contested the 2020 results that he lost, refused to concede to Joe Biden, and then faced criminal charges tied to the Jan. 6 riot at the US Capitol. — Darren",usatoday,2025-04-29T11:21:35,-6

"Hey there! Darren Samuelsohn here from USA TODAY. I’m the White House, Congress & Campaigns editor here overseeing our coverage for the nation’s newspaper and its network of papers from coast to coast. Thanks for the great questions.  Several people have asked about the “flood the zone” strategy from this administration. It’s been no secret that this is the playbook for the White House. It got telegraphed in many of the early planning documents that were well covered during the 2024 campaign too. They are making a steady stream of news on all fronts – from US policy to global affairs. It can absolutely be challenging to cover and requires making many decisions over the course of any given day about where to focus a newsroom’s resources.    It’s important to keep in mind the White House briefing room is just one place reporters go to get their questions answered. There can be limited details or direct answers provided, so we use our best reporting skills to uncover the facts. It’s why you hear reporters asking the same question in different ways. Also keep in mind that the WH briefing is not an ideal place for an in-depth discussion.   Competitively, it’s also the place where I’d be least interested in posing a question on a story where my team might be working toward an exclusive. We can go directly to the White House for a response without doing it on camera in a briefing. We may or may not get an answer but it’s often a better route to take.  What would I do to change the flow of the conversations with the White House?   Remember the media is no monolith. We compete against each other. We may piggyback on another outlet's coverage. We may try something totally different. Our responsibility is to report the facts and inform the public-- not to control the narrative.   Also worth noting: Every White House handles the press different. Trump's approach has been to flood the zone and keep their critics in a defensive mode. That's a political strategy they're taking - it's what motivated their base as well to turn out and then win the election. Whether it's effective for the Trump team is a great question. They are stepping on their own news a good bit and it might even be one of the reasons their polling numbers are sagging as the American public does its best to digest what's what on any given day. — Darren",usatoday,2025-04-29T11:07:15,129
"Asking follow up questions is important and it doesn't happen enough, at the White House or anywhere else. This is sometimes by design. When presidents take questions, they often quickly move on to the next reporter rather than allow themselves to be challenged again. Situations like this are an opportunity for collaboration between media outlets to pin down public officials.  I would also say that, politicians have lots of practice at sidestepping questions that they don't like. So if you're watching a press conference and you're not satisfied, check the article afterward. That's where a journalist can make clear where people were evasive and where the facts don't add up. Here's a recent article that pointed out Trump's shifting stances on tariffs, and how he contradicted himself.

"**From Andrew Romano:**  Hey, Andrew from Yahoo News here, just signing on for the next hour. As I scroll through the questions so far, I’m seeing a lot about “sanewashing” and narratives. You’re effectively asking reporters to be media critics.  As I ponder those lines of inquiry, let me answer this one, because I think it’s related.  The truth is, journalists HAVE done “a comprehensive review comparing the movements of the first 100 days and telegraphing of intentions to Project 2025, section-by-section.” One of those journalists is my former Newsweek colleague David Graham, now at The Atlantic. In fact, David has just published a[ whole book on the subject](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-project-how-project-2025-is-reshaping-america-david-a-graham/22301518?ean=9798217153725&next=t&next=t%2Ct&affiliate=12476). For the TLDR, check out [this installment](https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/04/project-2025-goals-trump-presidency/682597/) of his Atlantic newsletter.  And David’s not alone. Here’s a [similar accounting from Melissa Quinn at CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-project-2025-first-100-days/). I’m sure Google could find me many more examples if I asked.  So what does this have to do with so-called sanewashing? A lot of the things that Trump critics want journalists to do are actually being done on a daily basis. But in such a fragmented media environment, people don’t notice, and the larger narrative doesn’t change. I guess what I’m saying is that it's a systemic issue rather than a failure of nerve; that it has more to do with the way we consume information these days than with the quality of information that’s available, if you know where to look.",yahoonews,2025-04-29T13:07:26,8
"It’s 100 percent true that part of the White House’s strategy is to “flood the zone.” They just do so many things and challenge people to pay close enough attention. And it’s even more pronounced this time, with Trump more untethered than he was in his first term (when he was surrounding by more cautious people).Some big stories that I think haven’t gotten enough attention: pardoning Jan. 6 defendants who assaulted police, conflicts of interest (Musk’s businesses and Trump’s meme coin), the Justice Department’s efforts to get the Eric Adams case dismissed (which led to multiple resignations). -- Aaron",washingtonpost,2025-04-29T12:00:12,127
"**From Andrew Romano:**   A strategy of this administration has been to make so much noise that journalists cannot possibly cover every big move that Trump is making. What are some big moves that you felt have gone largely unnoticed by the public due to larger stories drowning them out?  I agree with Aaron that the biggest Trump stories — tariffs, Musk/DOGE, deportations, etc. — have tended to drown out important reporting about pardons, conflicts of interest and Trump’s takeover of the Justice Department. I certainly have not written about those subjects as much as I would like.  But this firehose dynamic can sometimes have the inverse effect. In March I noticed friends on Instagram sharing a post about how “Trump has ordered over 100 million hectares of forest” — the equivalent of 280 million acres — “to be chopped down.” It seemed to be catching on PRECISELY BECAUSE the “media” wasn’t talking about it.  But was it true? I did a [story](https://www.yahoo.com/news/did-trump-really-order-280-million-acres-of-national-forest-to-be-cut-down-223112112.html) to find out. The answer: Trump quietly signed an executive order on March 1 called “[Immediate Expansion of American Timber Production](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/immediate-expansion-of-american-timber-production/)” that was designed to reduce, streamline or circumvent environmental regulations in order to increase domestic timber production and reduce imported timber from places like Canada. In theory, it could put 250 million acres at risk — but in reality, the U.S. logging industry wouldn’t have the sawmills or workers required to ramp up and raze forests “nearly three times the size of California” within the next four years.  That article attracted nearly 12,000 comments. Point being, there’s definitely a market for stories about subjects other than, say, Elon Musk — and it’s worth paying attention to ongoing conversations (online or irl) to find them.",yahoonews,2025-04-29T14:03:34,35
"It’s a very good question. The barrage of news has made it hard for any consumer of news to stay up to speed- even if the reporting is out there to be found on the interwebs. While there was lots of coverage around the January 6 pardons, I think there’s ample journalism to be done about the personal stories behind the clemencies and also what the president’s actions say about the rule of law.   Another topic that I think the public will be hearing plenty more about in the coming weeks and months: Trump’s tax and spending legislation as it starts moving on Capitol Hill. It’ll be a story that unfolds in many hearing rooms and often in the deal-making that happens behind closed doors. But these are very important policies that affect every American. — Darren",usatoday,2025-04-29T11:45:49,56

I generally don’t read my question but some reporters do.

Are tariffs going to raise prices? Almost definitely. But do we know exactly how much? No. Part of being a journalist is recognizing that you can’t predict things. And sometimes you think you know something for sure that doesn’t turn out to be true.

"This White House is undoubtably combative with the media, and it's more willing to use legal and governmental pressure to shape coverage. Officials have also exerted control over the traditional pool system and included right wing outlets that are more likely to ask favorable questions of the president.

"Well, the courts reinstated AP, with a Trump-appointed judge saying the administration’s actions appeared to be blatant retaliation that violated the First Amendment. And I’d be shocked if the poll lawsuit in Iowa goes anywhere. With some of this, it’s just a matter of the courts taking time to weigh in.      Some of the more significant things worth watching are the FCC’s investigations of outlets Trump doesn’t like, along with whether the administration blocks mergers.

"**From Andrew Romano:**  There is a lack of trust in journalism due to how this administration is covered. How are you hoping to earn the trust back of the American people and what are you doing to keep true honest journalism alive?  As individual journalists, all we can do is… good journalism. We can’t change the systemic issues (algorithms, polarization, declining trust in all institutions, political scapegoating, paywalls) that contribute to the problem. At least not collectively and completely.  So what is “good journalism” in the Age of Trump? I can only speak for myself. Unlike some of my colleagues here, I focus on analysis rather than scoops. I generally let others find out *what’s* going on — a heroic task! I try to help readers *understand* what’s going on.  Yahoo’s reach is huge, so I take this responsibility seriously. The best way I can describe my approach is with an example. I got the sense recently that people were getting confused by all of Trump’s new deportation tactics. Most readers had probably seen headlines about, say, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, but did they really understand how many changes Trump was making — and how those changes have been affecting ordinary people?  So I spent a few days trying to distill it all down and make it as clear as possible. I ended up with a 3,500-word story that I hope helps at least some readers — especially the ones who don’t follow every single micro-update — make sense of Trump’s immigration crackdown.

I do lots of talks at universities or in my community to try to help people understand what it’s like to cover the news, the White House or the administration.

But it’s clearly the path he has chosen, and it’s a major departure for American foreign policy that would take many years to unwind.

I would be shocked if the Supreme Court didn’t rein in Trump on things like the Alien Enemies Act and Birthright Citizenship once those cases get to full rulings. The question is how much. He’s done a bunch of things that obviously flout the law and precedent and basically challenged judges/the justices to rein him in.

"Competing in this media landscape is not easy, especially in a world where information is often consumed through partisan lenses and delivered to partisan audiences. Each media company has its own audience too and we’re all increasingly aware of who those people are watching/clicking/reading and what else it is they want to watch/click/read.  Speed is one way to reach an audience. That’s no different from when I got going in this business back in the pre-internet era. The faster you can deliver news the more likely your audience can find it.   We also try to differentiate ourselves by seeking out exclusive stories that can be found nowhere else. That requires all manner of skill, contacts, shoe leather and sometimes luck.   We also pride ourselves at USA TODAY at trying to boil things down for readers far beyond the Washington beltway.

"**From Andrew Romano:**  I don’t think this is 4D foreign-policy chess, but I also don’t think it’s as simple as trolling (though trolling is definitely part of it!). Some [observers](https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/oleary-warns-trump-trudeau-very-negative-relationship-has-just-gotten-worse) have speculated that Trump’s animosity toward Canada is primarily personal; they’ve mentioned his troubled business dealings there — including [a Toronto hotel and condominium complex that went into receivership in 2016](https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-tower-canada-close-sale-name-may-change-171438527--finance.html) and [a Vancouver hotel that failed the following year](https://www.yahoo.com/news/owner-trump-hotel-vancouver-files-235353871.html) — and all the sniping with Trudeau.  But I tend to see it as more general than specific. Trump doesn’t care about Canada’s history as America’s closest ally. He doesn’t even distinguish between the Canadian right and the Canadian left, really. Instead, he views Canada (inaccurately) as one more freeloader country bent on ripping America off, just like all the rest.  As Trump put it in February, “It’s not fair for us to be supporting Canada. If we don’t support them, they don’t subsist \[sic\] as a nation.”This is not a new theme for Trump; it bubbled up during his first term as well. I just think he’s emboldened now to treat allies with total indifference, even hostility. Canada is simply the starkest example of that shift. ",yahoonews,2025-04-29T13:32:43,40
"I’ve been thinking A LOT about this. Like, the White House had to know that Trump was helping the Liberal Party with his tariffs and the “51st state” talk. The [trends were just so obvious](https://x.com/taniel/status/1917044062408085593?s=12&t=N7cmnHIUO4EgOjTNcEWyuA). Trump even seemed to [admit as much](https://x.com/AaronBlake/status/1916931429671506289) in his interview last week with the Atlantic. But he kept doing the 51st state stuff anyway, including on election day — and even though that idea is hugely unpopular both [in the United States](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/29/trump-poll-canada-greenland-third-term/) and Canada.      Some people have posited that perhaps Trump prefers to have Mark Carney in charge as a foil, rather than the Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre. So maybe he deliberately torpedoed Poilievre.      Having watched Trump for so long, though, I think that’s over-thinking it. He just suddenly likes the idea of taking new territory (see: Greenland and the Panama Canal). And the Canada stuff is a fun bit of trolling for him, at the very least. Does he care who’s in charge in Canada? I kind of doubt it. It’s just an idea he has in his head that people in his first administration would have pushed him away from, but those people are gone. -- Aaron",washingtonpost,2025-04-29T12:35:30,58

"It’s a really good question. I could point to a few things.      One is that Congress’s membership has become much more Trump-aligned in recent years. The critics leave or are defeated, and they are replaced by much more MAGA candidates. And there has been LOTS of turnover, more than I think many people realize.      The second is that Republican leaders have come to understand that they are Trump’s party. Many thought he’d go away after 2020; that obviously didn’t happen. So whether they agree with what Trump is doing or not, they recognize that it’s the path their party is on. And so they had better own it/make the best of it.      And the last is that I think the last four years especially have beaten down Trump’s internal critics. So many people thought he was done-for and that they could break with him, through so many controversies. And he always came back. At some point, these politicians will start to question their own judgment about when they can break with him and whether it’s worth it.      All of these are political calculations rather than moral ones, it bears emphasizing. It’s just where I think this is coming from. -- Aaron",washingtonpost,2025-04-29T12:07:35,34
"It depends on what “resistance” you’re thinking of. In recent weeks, you’ve seen some of the more normie-resistance on the [center left](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/democrats-great-new-society-post-trump-rcna202632) get reactivated, and those widespread protests you saw in cities across the country — some of which were quite sizeable — told you that part of the country is reenergized after the post-Trump victory burnout. The videos you’re seeing from some Republican town halls or the big crowds showing up for the Bernie/AOC tour show there’s energy to push back on Trump. Democrats and their allies have also had successes pushing back on Trump in the courts.  [Within the government](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/government-lawyers-ethics-help-trump-crackdown-bar-associations-rcna190460), there are a few things at play. One of the right’s preeminent goals ahead of the last election — and the main thrust of Project 2025 — was to ensure that Trump or any Republican president would be able to surround themselves with a much more MAGA staff to avoid what happened the first time around, where virtually every day some internal conflict and private dispute was being played out in the press while some officials were actively working to restrain Trump’s instincts and some initiatives. As a result, there’s much less of that this time around.  The federal workforce is massive, [and there are some civil servants who are engaging in forms of resistance](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/doge/federal-workers-fight-back-trump-dismantles-work-radicalized-rcna192040) to much of what Elon/Trump are/were trying to do with DOGE.  In Congress, there’s no resistance to Trump on the Republican side as almost every non-MAGA Republican was booted from office over the past decade.

Same goes when Republicans come into power. I’ve seen this with each permeation of power dating back to my arrival in DC in late 2000. So, to answer your question it’s not so much that connections change as that the people who worked for Trump in his campaign may not be so willing to talk the way they did when they were on the outside and Biden was president.

"On both counts, no. Virtually everyone who gets into political journalism — or, really, any other beat — does so with the understanding that people will often be deeply critical or even outright hostile toward you as a result of your work. They may also be hostile because of someone else’s reporting, and they’ve grouped all journalists together as a sort of monolith. I haven’t noticed any significant change in those sentiments this year when speaking with people.   I still firmly believe in the mission of the work, which includes providing people with accurate information that can help inform their daily lives, especially as they engage with government and the political system. Not every line of work affords you the chance to do something that still has a chance at serving the broader public good, and I don’t take that responsibility lightly.  A couple further points here: When you’re in the field and actually communicating with people face–to-face, people are almost never openly hostile, no matter what they think of the press. Most people, regardless of their political viewpoints, are quite open to someone else hearing them out.   One other thing to shape some thinking here: When President Trump and Elon Musk were firing off rapid fire changes for the federal workforce, dozens upon dozens of civil servants reached out to the press because they felt the only recourse they had was speaking with reporters, giving their perspective and sharing information on what was going down in their agencies. It was a reminder of the critical role journalists still play in our form of government, and, in a time of crisis, there are people from all walks of life who trust and understand the press.      \- Allan Smith",nbcnews,2025-04-29T13:47:15,12

I.e. “I’ll take away access” or “I’ll hurt you in other ways.” That’s where this administration is breaking new ground.

"Great question! The answer might not be that satisfying though. Ultimately, the biggest part of this is doing the same research you’re doing, though we have some additional tools available to us.

"This might be difficult, but I think you have to acknowledge that not everything they’re hearing/watching/or reading about is wrong, just because it’s coming from a conservative or right-wing news source. Not at all saying you’re doing that. But, the first step in getting someone to see where you’re coming from is to see where they’re coming from. Try to engage with content they are consuming where you’re able to acknowledge that, yes, this is a legit story, and they might be more likely to take your input on other stories.  Also, and this is big, but so many conservative/right-wing news stories are born out of stories that appear in the mainstream media. I mean, as an example, how many stories on Fox News get displayed on the screen and are cited to the New York Times, Wall Street Journal or Washington Post, just to name a few.

"I actually don’t think this is unique to this administration at all. People who work in politics insist in almost every private conversation to be attributed only on “background” — can’t use their name but can describe who they are/list what their connection to the story is — or entirely off-the-record. Sometimes people do this to say the most anodyne things. I mean they’ll ask to be on background and then say something like “my boss is the best person ever!” This happens on both sides and has for years. We have the discretion of course to determine whether someone can be quoted on background, and source-approving here is a rigorous process involving editors that is taken very seriously.  But there’s another layer to this, and it has to do with Trump’s staff choices. He has a group around him that is not only very committed to him/the MAGA brand. There’s also a smaller group around him that wields power, whereas there were many more power centers, often in competition with each other, during his first term. Going to also note that there is a whole host of new conservative media outlets/online platforms that have sprouted or grown since Trump’s first term.  All of this has contributed to a different relationship between the Trump admin and the MSM then there was the first time around.

Where are the direct quotes of his disjointed, meandering diatribes? Where are the simple callouts for lies? Where is the pushback when he tells you your question was nasty?   Where’s the on-air talking head reading, verbatim, his mouth diarrhea to show how crazy he is? Where is the news anchor summing up Trump’s “statement” by pointing out he never actually said anything?   Instead we get edited sentences that make him sound coherent and actually gave a concrete opinion.   Part of Trump’s super power is talking for five minutes, never actually saying anything, and leaving the listener to project whatever meaning they want onto his words.

"Fair response. I think there is a tendency amongst journalists to say ""Hoorah, we're journalists! We'll always ask the hard questions!"" when asked about their approach to Whitehouse questions. I do think ""phrasing questions in a way the President will want to answer"" sounds like prioritizing *getting* answers over asking the truly hard hitting questions.   As far as incentives go, the incentives come from the top down. Owners and managers want profits, downloads, views and engagement. Pressure to achieve those success factors is omnipresent in the corporate media world. Ethical standards might be a countervailing force that unionized reporters, or ethical managers might push back with, but that's hope as a tactic. As long as the decision makers' incentives are profit regardless of public good, then public good will always suffer in the face of profit.   Just this week a producer on 60 minutes resigned in protest because of pressure from his bosses about coverage and criticism of the Trump administration. I think to say the journalists are by and large well meaning is a facile response to larger market forces that co-opt well meaning journalists to serve the bottom lines of owners of media. You don't have to censor stories, you just have to promote and reward journalists that toe the line you want. Does Fox News need to send Sean Hannity a script to get him to say what he says?

"The format of press briefings is not conducive to anything resembling in-depth reporting. The format is basically:  Journalist: *""asks question""*  Press Sec: *""non-answer""*  Journalist: *""asks follow-up for clarification""*  Press Sec: *""slightly more agitated non-answer""*  And that's pretty much it.

Trump was already attacking the ""fake news media"", and Acosta became the poster boy for the ""fake news"" moniker.  The faceless media boogieman was now directly targetable and Trump attacked CNN and Acosta so much that they had to put out massive ad campaigns on their own TV network, website, and mobile app defending their reporting just months after the following interaction that occurred during a press briefing:  *...The seven-minute* [*exchange*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-J4FvxtD9I)*, in which Miller delivered a surprisingly personal rebuke of Acosta’s argument—“one of the most outrageous, insulting, ignorant and foolish things you have ever said”—was riveting television and spawned an entire news cycle’s worth of coverage, as commentators scored it like a heavyweight bout. Debate points aside, the battle cemented Acosta’s undisputed role as the chief antagonist for a network that styles itself as Trump’s chief antagonist, a sparring partner for the administration in the unscripted reality TV show that is the daily briefing.*  *Fans leave bourbon in Acosta’s mailbox and stop him on the street to thank him for standing up to Trump’s policies and press-bashing; his critics, some of them within his own newsroom, worry he has strayed into naked partisanship in pursuit of ratings and allowed himself to be cast as the perfect foil for an administration that has pegged the mainstream media as an enemy.*  [https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/09/21/jim-acosta-cnn-white-house-trump-favorite-reporter-215628/](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/09/21/jim-acosta-cnn-white-house-trump-favorite-reporter-215628/)  Here is a source for CNN's launch of the ""Facts First"" campaign: [https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/cnn-advertising-fake-news-facts-first-1202596220/](https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/cnn-advertising-fake-news-facts-first-1202596220/)  To MAGA, Acosta was all the confirmation they needed that Trump was spot on about the ""lyin' press"". And the worst part? ALMOST NO ONE REMEMBERS THE SUBSTANCE OF THOSE CONTENTIOUS INTERACTIONS. They just remember the sparring.

"No this is about more than the White House press briefings, this admin has plenty of other public facing events where they are not pressed by reporters who are there. This makes the reporters look terrible and they appear complicit with not asking questions the American people want asked/followed up on. I get I used White House briefing as an example but lets good faith discuss the heart of my original question, that this media strategy by the White House is done specifically to harm journalists credibility and the journalists are just taking it. They need a strategy change in those environments, their writing is good this time around generally on the issues and specific stories, but they need to again capture people who are on other forms of media. That starts with appearing to push back on the admin on video, not by their updates to stories days later.",Most_Thing8104,2025-04-29T13:27:54,8
"Short of rewriting their entire style guide to use more forceful and less ""politically correct"" tone, i.e. saying a person or administration is flat-out lying, I don't know. The language needs to be more direct and geared towards, sadly, a population that seems to lack critical thinking skills.",Hamonwrysangwich,2025-04-29T13:09:45,8

“People whose jobs are to expertly convey information in a sequential and intuitive way are doing just that? Must be AI”   It’s more stuff like the above unfounded paranoia that makes me think we’re doomed than anything.,David_Browie,2025-04-29T12:39:17,3
I deleted an earlier response because I rushed through your comment and replied too quickly. I agree with you on principle. I just find those stories they are doing much more valuable than the theater of calling him a liar and getting kicked out.,AHotDodgerDog,2025-04-29T14:03:16,2

OK? Well you be you and just not question what the media is doing and I'll be me and question everything. Best of luck with your choices. I don't really care.,PestoPastaLover,2025-04-29T13:01:01,0
What woman?,AHotDodgerDog,2025-04-29T13:56:18,1
Caroline Levitt. She reminds me of the Baghdad Bob. The Iraqi information minister. I was commenting on the White House Press briefings and how she handles them.,ReasonEmbarrassed74,2025-04-29T14:32:30,3
