"Trump has frequently criticized SNL for its portrayals of him, particularly Alec Baldwin's impersonations. He has labeled the show as ""unfunny"" and ""biased,"" and there have been reports that he even inquired whether the Department of Justice or the FCC could take action against the program.    Trump was also upset by Jimmy Kimmel's jokes that his White House staff contacted Disney executives to complain and request that Kimmel tone down his monologues.    These instances illustrate a pattern where Trump is quick to use satire and mockery but often reacts defensively when he becomes the subject of such humor.   This is the double standard many people point out. Trump often uses satire, mockery, or exaggerated self-promotion when it benefits him, but when he becomes the target of humor, he frequently lashes out, calling it ‚Äúunfair,‚Äù ‚Äúdisrespectful,‚Äù or ‚Äúfake news.‚Äù",Reasonable-Demand1,2025-05-04T08:53:23,1
