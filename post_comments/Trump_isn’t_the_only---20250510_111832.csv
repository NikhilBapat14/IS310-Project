I have given up on even being remotely surprised by anything he does. Just sickening.,SucksYouSay,2025-05-10T12:35:22,7
We're suffering through another Republican round of severe unnecessary austerity because they don't want to pay the bills. Idiot Trump has executive ordered his deadbeat ways as a new excuse for the same old Republican Party.  When the debt limit is reached this summer and the country is about to default for the first time in American history it will be up to the Democrats in Congress to save America once more. It'll be a real battle since this president and this party don't care about paying any bills.,YallerDawg,2025-05-10T13:40:57,3

"I’m sure these house republicans will be the first in line to voluntarily give up their pension because don’t they love America so much, they should do it for free. Right? Right?",craniumcanyon,2025-05-10T13:48:55,2

"We have a new military parade to pay!   And a new golden Air Force One Jet so King Trump can fly in style to play golf which we the taxpayers are required to pay for.  So, be patriotic!  Cough up that pension as a patriot!   You are doing this for our Dear Leader!  And remember, we never have to vote again.   Those words were uttered by Trump himself on the campaign trail.  They brought a tear to my eye.  And I know by never voting again, King Trump will lead us through many more years of cutting waste fraud and abuse for the little people.  ![gif](giphy|vhy1DO5wlXDGK7qOIu|downsized)",Altruistic-Text3481,2025-05-10T14:44:05,1
