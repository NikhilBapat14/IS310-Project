Why would the Democrats block a bill over regulation?,Brilliant_Scheme558,2025-05-09T05:53:58,-13
"From the article you just commented on:  >After it became clear that Senate Republicans planned to put the bill on the floor this week, nine Senate Democrats who had been open to backing the bill penned a letter last Saturday saying they needed further changes to the legislation, beyond addressing concerns over Trump’s crypto dealings, before they could vote to advance it.  >“The bill as it currently stands still has numerous issues that must be addressed, including adding stronger provisions on anti-money laundering, foreign issuers, national security, preserving the safety and soundness of our financial system, and accountability for those who don’t meet the act’s requirements,” they wrote.",C_MMENTARIAT,2025-05-09T06:05:39,26
"I would say it is likely because sometimes, especially in brand new regulation, it is specifically tailored to benefit those who do not want themselves regulated. So the regulations are designed in order to ensure that those with a foothold already do not have to change anything or get in trouble for what they're doing. Or are able to continue on with business as usual.",mathgeek94,2025-05-09T06:51:49,8
