"The US Constitution grants *vastly* more power to Congress than either the President or the Judiciary. It's easy to forget (or never even realize) just how much authority Congress has because its members usually can't muster the majorities and supermajorities required to actually wield much of its power.  The Constitution was also not really written to be robust against lawyers exploiting technicalities and logical oversights to let the nation's representatives abuse their powers. It's probably an impossible requirement to have of a constitution anyway, since every system of laws must ultimately be enforced by people.  In any case, yeah, the Constitution permits Congress to determine how the federal courts operate, and even what cases they're allowed to hear. You might say that's bad or even nonsensical, but that's the current law.",Lorpius_Prime,2023-05-06T12:07:37,15
"The law you mentioned doesn't do what you say it does, but that's not necessary to answer your main question:  The constitution explicitly gives congress the power to regulate and create exceptions to the supreme court's jurisdiction.  So they can pass a law exempting a category/type of lawsuit (or case, etc) from the court's jurisdiction.   They do that all the time.  Article III, section 2:  >In all the other Cases before mentioned, **the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction**, both as to Law and Fact, **with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make.**",unebaguette,2023-05-06T19:57:38,5
"Is your contention that SCOTUS's power to set rules for the federal courts is intrinsic and not at the pleasure of Congress?  I think that would be persuasive should Congress try to interfere in that authority, especially since the relevant audience is SCOTUS itself.    However, nobody has standing to contest the current statute since it doesn't affect the power of the Court.  The statute might do nothing, but courts don't get involved with laws that don't do anything, only ones that have a negative effect on someone.",gsfgf,2023-05-06T15:56:30,1
"Your hypothetical hasn’t happened, so there hasn’t been a determination on the issue. The Act itself hasn’t been in question. Laws aren’t just judged constitutional or not in a vacuum; there has to be a contested action. If Congress rewrote the law to say what you wrote, then there might be a case for it being an unconstitutional law (on a checks and balances kind of ruling).",tysontysontyson1,2023-05-07T08:42:54,1
How is the determination of the rules of the Court not an intrinsically judicial action?,AlexKingstonsGigolo,2023-05-06T23:23:37,1
"Your opening statement is demonstrably false; from 2071:  > (a) The Supreme Court and all courts established by Act of Congress may from time to time prescribe rules for the conduct of their business. Such rules shall be consistent with Acts of Congress and rules of practice and procedure prescribed under section 2072 of this title.  It literally does what I said it does.  Meanwhile, the rest of your comment is about *jurisdiction* and not rules of the Court(s). So, you answered some question but not the one I asked.",AlexKingstonsGigolo,2023-05-06T23:26:18,-1

Because Article III of the Constitution gives Congress the power to set up and regulate the courts.,Lorpius_Prime,2023-05-07T06:34:10,7
"I think the idea would be that although Article III states that ""the judicial power"" shall be vested in the Supreme Court and whatever lower courts Congress chooses to establish, substantive rules like rules of procedure, jurisdiction, and evidence, have always been deemed to be set by the legislature.  In other words, could the British Parliament have prescribed rules of evidence that English courts had to follow?  If so, the backdrop understanding of the Constitution is that ""the judicial power"" encompasses whatever general power the English courts were thought to possess, and if that did not include the sole power to set rules of evidence, then it is not an exclusive judicial power.  (I don't know the exact history of English courts but feel this must be the case because I am unaware of any case in U.S. history that challenged the ability of Congress to set jurisdiction, procedure, or evidence rules of the court system.)",digbyforever,2023-05-09T23:07:18,1
"The section you quoted imposes a requirement for each federal court to follow the rulemaking process when they make any changes to their procedures.    The rest of the law describes what that process is.   The ""supreme court"" is mentioned because it is a federal court.    And your original post is almost entirely about congress passing a hypothetical law to exempt itself from the supreme courts jurisdiction.  I was responding to that.",unebaguette,2023-05-07T02:29:32,5
"I was thinking about this and, actually, no. As a general rule, almost nobody ever has standing to challenge violations of the Establishment Clause; however, the courts have held, when a government action blatantly violates that provision, a general-public standing exists nonetheless; a similar argument can be made, if the T.O.N. clause were violated.",AlexKingstonsGigolo,2023-05-06T23:32:52,1
"Perhaps what they're saying is that it isn't necessarily constitutional, but it is a hyper specific scenario which hasn't come up yet so thus hasn't been evaluated on whether it is constitutional yet. So it would be challenged at the time it became relevant",faebugz,2023-05-07T21:24:30,2

"Article I:  > All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.  You seem to think the default is that the courts decide on their own rules of procedure. That’s backwards. Judicial procedure is part of the law, and writing law is by default Congress’s authority. This isn’t some quirk of the US federal judicial system; around the world, codes of civil and criminal procedure are routinely written by legislatures and not by courts. As part of its authority to set up the federal court system, Congress gets to lay out jurisdiction and procedures for that court system to follow.  There are obviously limits to Congress’s authority. For instance, Congress could not pass a law requiring a court to rule a particular way in a particular case (although depending on the circumstances, it might be able to change the substantive law so that one side clearly wins). But the rules discussed in the Rules Enabling Act don’t affect the judiciary’s independence in particular cases. They’re general rules applying to all cases.",cpast,2023-05-07T13:58:00,3

"What I am saying is the determination of judicial procedure is intrinsically an act of judicial authority. If the Congress can grant the Court authority to write its own rules, the Congress can also take away that authority; it can likewise condition that authority. If the Congress can condition that authority, it can preclude rules which allow for the admission of any evidence the Congress has engaged in an unconstitutional action and include rules which prohibit the admission of such evidence. As a result, it can dictate rules which automatically determine the outcome of cases before they are ever filed, including cases where Congressional action would otherwise have been found prohibited.",AlexKingstonsGigolo,2023-05-07T18:54:05,0

"> What I am saying is the determination of judicial procedure is intrinsically an act of judicial authority.  And what I’m saying is that this is simply wrong. You’re starting with a faulty assumption and then getting confused from there. The law of evidence, and rules of judicial procedure, are fundamentally *legislative* decisions.  > If the Congress can grant the Court authority to write its own rules, the Congress can also take away that authority; it can likewise condition that authority.  It can, it does, and it has.   > If the Congress can condition that authority, it can preclude rules which allow for the admission of any evidence the Congress has engaged in an unconstitutional action and include rules which prohibit the admission of such evidence.  Maybe in theory? Congress certainly has some power to exclude federal courts from reviewing things.  > As a result, it can dictate rules which automatically determine the outcome of cases before they are ever filed, including cases where Congressional action would otherwise have been found prohibited.  Yeah, Congress can do that to a much greater extent than you seem to think. Of course, decisions about constitutionality are generally *legal* decisions and not factual decisions. And interbranch conflict can give messy outcomes, as seen with Guantanamo cases (where Congress eventually conceded to the Supreme Court).",cpast,2023-05-07T19:04:04,3

"In general, to establish standing under Article III, a plaintiff must establish (1) they personally suffered some actual or were threatened injury as the result of the challenged conduct, (2) the injury to the plaintiff can be reasonably traced to the challenged conduct, and (3) the injury is likely to be redressed by a decision from the court, which is basic standing requirements.  In the case of the Establishment Clause, standing can also exist when the circumstances of a case demonstrate there is a logical nexus between the status asserted and the claim sought to be adjudicated. First, there must be a logical link between the the individual and the type of legislative enactment attacked; this means One must allege the unconstitutionality only of exercises of congressional power under the spending clause of Article I, § 8, rather than also of incidental expenditure of funds in the administration of an essentially regulatory statute. Second, there must be a logical nexus between the individual and the precise nature of the constitutional infringement alleged; this means that the individual must show the challenged enactment exceeds specific constitutional limitations imposed upon the exercise of the spending power, rather than simply arguing the enactment is generally beyond the powers delegated to Congress.  The controlling case on the subject is *Flast v. Cohen* and, while that case focused on the notion of “taxpayer standing”, nothing in the wording of the Establishment Clause limits its protections to taxpayers, making its protections equally available to others in the United States.",AlexKingstonsGigolo,2023-05-07T13:31:37,1

"Eh...in some sense yes, and in another sense, no.  Ironically, and barring an amendment, such an act would be subject to judicial review and most likely fail because of how it would upset the balance of power in the federal government.  Congress has powers and responsibilities beyond simply passing legislation - approving judicial/cabinet positions, ratifying treaties, contingent elections, and impeachment to name a few.  One could argue the Amendment process is legislative in nature, but that doesn't NECESSARILY have to involve Congress.  To that end, there is not a single legislative power of Congress that is NOT reviewable.  Any attempt to write ""BTW this legislation is immune to judicial review"" would outright be a violation of the courts interpretations of the constitution and be deemed unconstitutional.  See *City of Boerne v. Flores*.  Per the 14th Amendment's Enforcement Clause, Congress CAN create remedial or preventive processes to deal with constitutional violations, but Congress CANNOT define what it or isn't a constitutional violation; that's a power left exclusively up to the courts.",Ent3rpris3,2023-05-08T14:05:13,1

"Appellate courts don't analyze evidence the same way trial courts do, and the appellate courts don't introduce evidence - they rely exclusively on the evidence presented at trial to analyze, among other things, how the law interacts with that evidence.  In your example, someone might sue and attempt to present evidence at trial, but this law would prevent that.  The trial court would make its decision, and the unable-to-produce-evidence party would no doubt appeal.  The appellate court would then analyze the record of the case, which would normally include all of the evidence presented at trial.  The appellate court would then look at the applications of law, the rules of civil procedure, and other things like judicial discretion or proper jury instruction and see if anything was done in error.  Among this review would be an analysis of the applicable laws, chief among them being this law that would have prevented the introduction of evidence by the suing party.  In reviewing this case, basically any appellate court would see this drastic action as a breach of the social contract, and no doubt this would be a blatant violation of due process guaranteed by - at minimum - the 5th and 14th Amendments.  Thus, upon this review, the appellate court would deem that law unconstitutional.  Regardless of the composition of the court, or the process of how it got there, I have every expectation that the Supreme Court would agree with my assessment.",Ent3rpris3,2023-05-10T00:21:13,1
