"There is no ""pure"" form of government, it's all hybrid because we live in a world that requires checks and balances.  I.e. there is no pure socialism or pure democracies, etc - but there are social democracies and democratic republics, and so on.  Your suggestion of a just, utilitarian, authoritarian Philosopher King state is the same situation.  In an ideal world the system you propose would be just as ideal as a pure democracy or socialist state in the same ideal world - because there are no problems inherent to humans that need to be accounted for.  Predictably in the face of that concept, the downside that China faces is corruption.  So many of the CCP's decisions are targeted to make the CCP look good, thereby protecting its control of China, rather than targeted for serving the people or their rights.  For that reason too a lot of the data the CCP publishes (or forces the localities to enforce at all costs) is biased in favor of the CCP too.",theRuathan,2024-06-05T15:47:57,7
"China's political system is actually quite clunkey. The size of the bureaucracy (not to mention the size of the population) makes it logistically difficult for the central government to implement new policies. The multitude of ministries, departments, and commissions have varying levels of authority on a wide variety of fields and are under the influence of different factions and interests. Often, 2 or more agencies will have jurisdiction over the same regional project, leading to bureaucratic turf wars.  Further confounding this mess is that every local and provincial agency answers to 3 separate superiors. A local environmental agency reports not only to the local government but to that province's environmental agency and to the local committee of the Communist Party as well. What do you do if your 3 bosses all tell you to do something different?  In this setting of conflicting interests, unclear jurisdictions, and multiple lines of supervision, corruption is often the only means by which anything ever gets done. It could be bribes to agency heads, lucrative positions for a mayor's children, or any other number of benefits offered under the table. Because corruption is so widespread in China, anti-corruption campaigns by the government are not so much about cleaning up politics as they are about purging political and economic rivals.",ArchdukeAlex8,2024-06-05T16:05:10,8
"Corruption. And no one dares tell you to stop.  Might makes right. You don’t need to listen to any advice or have the need for compromise force you to develop your ideas. No one dares speak truth to you so the country depends on you always reaching the perfect decision on your own . On top of that, sometimes the perfect decision is only perfect for SOME of the populace and bad for others. Depending on how bad, it could be morally indefensible.",KasreynGyre,2024-06-05T17:32:00,5
Just one simple answer: Enacting decisions efficiently doesn't mean they're good decisions.    Mao famously got it wrong with the four pests campaign. Tens of millions of people died.,PM-me-in-100-years,2024-06-05T18:56:39,6
"> The upside of this is that they are able to be highly efficient. Rather than being bogged down by endless debates, political polarization, the constant handing off of power, they are able to make decisions and act very rapidly in the face of changing environments.  This is a myth. Authoritarian governments are not more efficient than democracies. They have less accountability, oversight is arbitrary, and management positions are determined more by cronyism than by merit.",Gurney_Hackman,2024-06-05T17:32:32,7
All gullible people love an authoritarian. The problem with authoritarians is they don’t listen to anyone so they do one dumb thing after another.,stewartm0205,2024-06-06T01:04:31,3
"Okay, so this is hardly the first time someone has thought along these lines, certainly. And it's absolutely true that even if both countries had total political will to achieve X, China would likely be able to get it done quicker than say, the USA.   But the devil is in the details.   True, they aren't bogged down by political debates in the same way western democracies are. But don't be fooled, they have factionalism almost as much as we do, it's just all considered to be under one ""party"". Instead of different parties, the infighting takes place more behind closed doors and within the greater Communist Party of China. Really what they've achieved is that the common folk have no exposure to what their government factions are arguing about.   You mention the constant handing off of power. While I suppose it could be true that a long-serving politician gets more effective at their job as time goes on, I might even agree with you, the fact is that term limits and re-elections are a feature, not a bug in democratic systems. The idea is that nobody can easily restructure the political system to revolve around themselves because they can't be there forever. It's to limit the power that one man holds. And yeah, that comes from western historical experiences with monarchies. For every wise king we had an idiot or a tyrant. The idea of a system that routinely hands off power is to ensure that what remains constant is the *system* not the person. With rules and policies and procedures, the idea is that the ""system"" (government departments, bureaucracy, etc) can remain reasonably effective all of the time no matter how competent the president or prime minister is.   Basically, the inefficiency that we complain of in democracy, is actually one of its most important features. The whole point of a democratic system is to avoid rapid decisions without oversight because all too often our historical experience taught us that ended terribly. Yes, sometimes we would all like our government to act a little faster, of course. But answering your question, sure, the philosopher king might be ideal. But that entirely misses the point. Philosopher kings don't exist. Either that or they are so rare as to not really matter.   Thats why we have the system we have. We did monarchy for several hundred years as a western culture bloc. We collectively did not like it. For every wise King, there was a fool. For every Bismarck there was a Nicholas II. Every Caesar there was a Nero. Yes democracy feels sluggish and mediocre, but we can reliably guarantee the mediocrity indefinitely. And from that jumping off point, we can improve reliably and we have been.",notpoleonbonaparte,2024-06-06T08:33:03,2

"In my opinion, the main problem within authoritarian systems is their lack of a juridical system that is good enough independent.   A western style government system ensures mainly two things: that power is not concentrated in one spot and peaceful transition of executive power. The guarantor for these two things is the sufficiently independent justice system.  In addition, with an independent justice system you can fight corruption on a systemic level instead of case by case with no end in sight. With rule of law, consequences of actions are more predictable than when you rely on contacts and their present mood. While authoritarian system can be very efficient in the short term, these things are good for civil society and businesses in the long run.",copperwoods,2024-06-06T05:04:46,1
">Rather than being bogged down by endless debates...  they are able to make decisions and act very rapidly in the face of changing environments.   This still happens in authoritarian governments.  The Japanese government in WWII was infamous for this, with the Supreme Council being unable to get a consensus on how to surrender, even after the nuclear bombings and USSR declaring war, forcing the Emperor to intervene.  The reason why the 1989 protests lasted as long as they did in China was because the CCP was completely divided on how to act, with local governments taking things into their own hands.  Authoritarian governments still run into issues of factions, political in-fighting, and other things that can slow down the political process even in times of crisis, and China is no exception to this with the numerous factions and people vying for political power within the party.  >political polarization  China has gone through massive political polarization over the last 20 years, in part due to media censorship.",Naliamegod,2024-06-06T05:46:19,1
In my eyes the issue w/ a one party system is that you don’t have a real way to stop it from being corrupt. You really just have to trust that they will do what’s best.,WerePigCat,2024-06-06T10:22:36,1
