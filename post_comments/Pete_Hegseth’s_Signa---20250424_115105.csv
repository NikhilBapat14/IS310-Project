">*The Washington Post* reports that the former Fox News host had Signal installed on his office computer at the Pentagon, a major security risk and further evidence that Hegseth used the messaging tool frequently for government business. According to the Post, the desktop app mirrored Hegseth’s phone and helped the secretary overcome the lack of cell phone service within the Pentagon.  >Cell phones and other personal electronic devices are not permitted within classified spaces, and installing Signal on his desktop computer allowed Hegseth to get around that prohibition. At least one of Hegseth’s top aides, his chief of staff Joe Kasper, also expressed interest in using Signal on Department of Defense computers, but it’s not clear how widespread the app is among Pentagon employees.  It just keeps growing and growing:  * [Here Are the Attack Plans That Trump’s Advisers Shared on Signal](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/signal-group-chat-attack-plans-hegseth-goldberg/682176/)  * [Hegseth Brought His Wife to Sensitive Meetings With Foreign Military Officials](https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/hegseth-brought-his-wife-to-sensitive-meetings-with-foreign-military-officials-c16db0ea)  * [Hegseth’s younger brother is serving in a key role as liaison and senior adviser inside the Pentagon](https://apnews.com/article/hegseth-brother-signal-dhs-hired-68678a8a653c79a4c6ae31a8bee64836)  * [Hegseth Said to Have Shared Attack Details in Second Signal Chat — The defense secretary sent sensitive information about strikes in Yemen to an encrypted group chat that included his wife and brother, people familiar with the matter said.](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/20/us/politics/hegseth-yemen-attack-second-signal-chat.html)   * [Info Hegseth shared with wife and brother came from top general's secure messages](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/info-hegseths-yemen-signal-texts-came-generals-secure-messages-rcna198838)  * [‘Full-blown meltdown’ at Pentagon after Hegseth’s second Signal chat revealed](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/21/hegseth-second-signal-chat-pentagon)  * [Fears grow that Signal leaks make Pete Hegseth top espionage target](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/23/pete-hegseth-pentagon-espionage)  DEI hires are a million times more qualified than loyalty hires.",brain_overclocked,2025-04-24T12:15:07,131

"Bonhoeffer understood all of this over eighty years ago.   >Stupidity is a more dangerous enemy of the good than malice. One may protest against evil; it can be exposed and, if need be, prevented by use of force. Evil always carries within itself the germ of its own subversion in that it leaves behind in human beings at least a sense of unease.  >Against stupidity we are defenseless.  >Neither protests nor the use of force accomplish anything here; reasons fall on deaf ears; facts that contradict one’s prejudgment simply need not be believed — in such moments the stupid person even becomes critical — and when facts are irrefutable, they are just pushed aside as inconsequential, as incidental. In all this the stupid person, in contrast to the malicious one, is utterly self-satisfied and, being easily irritated, becomes dangerous by going on the attack.  >For that reason, greater caution is called for than with a malicious one.

"This is partly true. I think another key fact is systems incompetence. I'm not excusing the actions, and I think accountability needs to occur, but here are observations on human behavior.   Getting into secure systems in a lot of governmental functions is burdensome. It requires a lot of extra passwords, ID cards, and for some people it means moving from their desk to a secure location. Political appointees from each side are notoriously lazy to learn and utilize these systems. This group of appointees..... it shouldn't surprise you.  Hegseth had access to his secure network at his desk well before he had a makeup studio.  So does Gabbard, unknown on CIA makeup studio. Folks in NSC, not always. Folks at state have to go to a secure location for SCI comms.  This is a logistics and convenience issue that is real, and hurts the snowflake hero concept of some appointees (and a lot of employees).  Using Signal implies a safe secure way to send messages. It is pretty good for a lot of people, and is used a lot to communicate to non-governmental individuals to protect their safety. It does not match our internal USG network (at least it didn't before DOGE bros [stole the JWICS servers](https://mitchthelawyer.substack.com/p/musks-doge-website-and-the-classified) out of USAID HQ). I'm actually pleasantly surprised they chose  signal over telegram or whatsapp. Both alternatives are quite compromised.

"Anyone who read the court documents for Trumps trials could clearly see that coming.   The publicly revealed evidence - despite excluding Trumps own communication to a large extent (by SC immunity ruling) - paints a very clear picture of Trump & friends **lying knowingly** to subvert election results.   It was clear that they would learn from that. It’s public knowledge that Trump himself doesn’t communicate electronically much (except addressing the public in unhinged tweets) but now of course those around him will follow suite since it turned out to be a winning strategy. It is still beyond me how so many Americans could ignore this - there are even podcast readings of the court documents, that people could have listened to on their commute. It’s all out there, but willful ignorance will apparently continue until a majority of people really feel the consequences of their ignorance.   Hegseth is only the tip of the iceberg, he’s getting exposed because he a) did overdo it stupidly and b) is under special obligations due to his job.
