"*“It’s actually a pretty shitty deal” for Americans.*  It has been *condemned by many top economists and which will, in effect, triple taxes that Americans pay on imports from the U.K.*   *“This so-called trade deal is a multi-billion $ tax hike...""*  Sounds about right.   The ""Art of the Deal"" was never a thing, it was all lies.",SAJ-13,2025-05-09T09:34:12,31

"But then, on an historic day, which is commemorated by my species and fully documented in the Sacred Scrolls, there came Aldo. He did not grunt. He articulated.

"How is this any sort of surprise?  Trump has repeatedly said that he wants tariffs. He wants tariffs because he wants to give super wealthy people a tax cut. And the word ""tariff"" is spelled differently than ""tax"" so he thinks he can get away with people believing that the increased prices that they see... are being paid by the other country?  It's absolutely insane. But the bottom line is that he wants tariffs in place. He's said it.  Repeatedly.  The ""fly in the ointment"" for him was that other countries reacted harshly. He just wanted to impose tariffs and have everyone accept it. Somehow import at the same level they had and consumers would just keep buying at the same rate. And that would generate all of this money that ... doesn't friggen exist.",CockBrother,2025-05-09T10:20:10,5

But please don’t disrespect “clapping back.”  Of course it didn’t start in 2025. I’m unclear when it passed the threshold to “usually ridiculous.” But it has been at least 4 years.,N7777777,2025-05-09T17:38:22,2
