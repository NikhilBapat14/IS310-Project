">""*We are not ignoring the rule of law*,"" DHS said.

She made a right turn on red when she wasn't supposed to. Maybe she didn't see the sign? Don't act like she's some kind of devious criminal! I just yesterday saw a car do the same thing (not follow a sign that said no right on red). That driver didn't get arrested. It's interesting that the trump admin keeps talking about protecting Americans from foreign murderers and rapists but now we're being protected from a person who turned right on red.,sachiprecious,2025-05-09T10:22:33,10

"Enforce laws which prohibit hiring..  Everyday in the news we are reading about this illegal alien deported for this, or that...  But we aren't seeing are law enforcement actions against the enablers.  For me, THAT IS THE REAL EVIL, the people knowingly hiring illegal workers. Enabling illegal behavior. This can be up to a $10,000 fine..  deporting illegals is one thing, but going after those which exploit and subvert IS THE BIGGER FISH.",powerstreamtv,2025-05-09T09:48:02,4

"The issue is that capitalism needs exploited labor to endure. Once that was the African slave trade, then it was Jim Crow... And then we started outsourcing to other nations where slavery or effective slavery was still widespread in combination with undocumented labor here at home. Virtually everything you consume is the byproduct of human exploitation.  No one wants to admit that if you start actually punishing the companies that utilize exploited labor, then our entire way of life collapses and ultimately, no one wants to (and in most cases can't) deal with the insane price hikes that would ensue.   So at the end of the day; no one who knows how the world really works wants them to go after the enablers, because until someone devises an entirely new economic system - we're all enablers.",Grey_0ne,2025-05-09T10:01:36,8

"\^\^\^ BINGO!  Until we move away from the holy dollar capitalism economy, there has to be an exploited workforce.

"I'm okay with saying consumers are selfish and when push comes to shove are morally corrupt and will almost choose what's best for themselves over what's correct.  The role of government is to safeguard fundamental human rights—life, liberty, property, and free expression—ensuring no individual or group is unjustly deprived of these. And to ensure equal treatment under the law, and addressing systemic inequalities to foster a just society.

"Most id requirements in financial transactions are cursory if that.   America has resisted the idea of a legit national id card, and for good reasons. Yet the same America has no issue with (a) posting everything they do on social media and (b) willingly or unwillingly feeding data to the aggregators / stalking sites / people search sites etc.   A functional e-verify system is certainly doable, assuming more than a cursory look from the powers that be is done.   However, there are gaping holes in the document list of what passes for acceptable. My SSN card does not say ""NOT VALID FOR EMPLOYMENT"" as it was issued before 1984 i think when SSA didn't care. Never mind it was issued to me as a college student from Europe on a student visa.   Republicans have seriously selective memory if they forget the millions of Reagan era amnesty cases, the millions more of chain migration that resulted, or the millions more of asylum / refugee status granted for political reasons during the 1980's. Or the lack of any employer sanctions.",debugprint,2025-05-09T13:01:09,1

"1.) It is unfortunate that she is from a family of illegals.  People often have bad parents who do bad deeds, but as an adult, its your responsibility to do the right thing. Many times, the right thing is going to be uncomfortable.  2.) My primary focus of my post was this.  But you ignored that comment and went down this road, I think enforcement should be as hard on the demand side as it is on the supply side.  3.) The ends do not justify the means. If she is such a bright and distingished student, she can return to the country of her citizenship, get her documentation correct, apply for a student visa.  Poor planning (or attempt to circumvent the system) on her part does not constitute an emergency on anyone else's part.  4.) Interactions with law enforcement when your living illegally are often going to result in consequences you don't intend.  When you are fully aware of your illegal status and still partake in illegal activities, you are doubly to blame.    5.) Zero tolerance would result in door-to-door sweeps.  In this case, the person willfully and knowingly put themselves into law enforcement eye.  You don't receive a get out of jail card for stupidity.   IF YOU ARE ILLEGAL and KNOW IT..  Self Deport.  If you refuse, you better keep your head down and stay out of enforcements reach because no grace should be given to known illegal activities no matter how well intended they might be.",powerstreamtv,2025-05-09T16:03:34,1
