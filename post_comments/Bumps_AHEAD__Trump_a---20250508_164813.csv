"So, what they're saying is let's make it so health care doesn't have to charge fair pricing and potentially raise the cost of care.  ",arilupe,2025-05-08T16:55:52,6
"Ideally, medicare should be abolished entirely.  This is not a function and health care is not some ""human right"".",box-cable,2025-05-08T16:52:28,-26
"There are few rights more fundamental than the right to not die preventable deaths merely because of your social status. Any reasonable person can recognize that the government has a duty to protect you from being killed by another person, and there's no reason why the same duty shouldn't apply to disease.",LunchOne675,2025-05-08T17:05:14,11
"I hope when you're old and unable to work and have no Medicare you will learn your lesson, until then ignorance is bliss right? ",arilupe,2025-05-08T16:57:33,8

"if something requires the labor of someone else, it is not a human right.  What if nobody wanted to be doctors?  Would the govt force some people to be doctors?   It's so absurd.",box-cable,2025-05-08T17:07:19,-22
This is what private insurance is for.,box-cable,2025-05-08T16:58:33,-11
Yet here you are benefitting from all that clean safe water off the backs of all those people who keep it safe and clean. Hypocrite!,DragonTHC,2025-05-08T17:13:44,6
"What world do you live in, where ""nobody wanted to be doctors?"" LOL",LocalStatistician538,2025-05-08T17:10:53,2
"Yes, that would be perfectly reasonable to conscript them. We've forced people to be soldiers when not enough people want to be soldiers to preserve our security, and its perfectly sensible that the government could do the same in other circumstances with other professions. What you are calling for is tantamount to the murder of disabled individuals who cannot work for themselves.     Society and our entire modern world rests on the fundamental understanding that sometimes the collective may compel individual behavior for the greater good. Additionally, consider that concepts like ""ownership"" themself only exist on the back of the government as without a government, the common people could simply seize property for themselves from those with more resources. There's nothing *innate* about ownership of land or intellectual property.",LunchOne675,2025-05-08T17:43:01,2
"You only get private insurance from working at reasonable rates because your job invests money into that too.  Private insurance is far from cheap outside of Obama care insurance (which is being removed).  Elderly have far more health care costs.  Think, research, before you pretend to understand ",arilupe,2025-05-08T17:01:28,5
except when your private insurance decides to drop you because you're too old and too much risk.  That doesn't happen to people on medicare.,DragonTHC,2025-05-08T19:10:50,5
