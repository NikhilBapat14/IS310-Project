Pledges mean jack shit. These companies are just telling Trump what he wants to hear so he picks a new target. They have no real plans to build anything here.,desperateorphan,2025-05-09T17:07:03,4
"I'm commandeering this space for my frenetic, breathless rant on the tech industry. I consider this a form of self-care at this point.  This doesn't surprise me at all, actually. The tech industry has been sucking on the taxpayer's wrinkled, drying teat since time immemorial, and any forward-thinking company in the trade recognizes the value of R&D, even more if you get a tax break, more still if you don't actually have to pay for it at all. In fact a lot, and I mean a **LOT** of these companies wouldn't even exist without the fruits of public research. Case and point: ARPANET.   Riddle me this, Jeffark Bezoberg, if China can pump out Mathematics and Electrical Engineering Ph.Ds by the millions and the EU can maintain a business climate wherein you can actually benefit from public research programs and operate your business **without** sucking the shit out of some fat orange bastard's asshole, why the evergreen minty fresh fuck would you ever willingly hitch your wagon to the omnicidal MAGA crazy train? A death cult that, to be clear, you helped to create in the first place?  Of course, the answer is simple. These people are idiots and megalomaniacs. The nuance here is completely lost on the particular species of power-hungry Yarvinite techbro ghoul that tends to flock to this administration like flies to cowshit. These are dudes hopelessly addicted to huffing their own jenkem like Kanye West on a nitrous respirator. Seriously, Musk gets on stage and says ""I think I know more about manufacturing than anyone on earth"" and throws his head back and rolls his eyes like he's about to cum. That's who these people really are.  Naturally, In their own minds, they think the greatest geniuses to ever live, with their very big, veiny, throbbing, well-moisturized brains. In reality they're just a bunch of shitty, delusional, coked-up idea-guys with more money than common sense. Most of them couldn't code their way out of a brown paper bag. It's an industry almost entirely propped up on futuremagic bullshit artistry to secure funds from tech-illiterate investors and generate mountains of the kind of shameless tech media cocksucking fluff pieces that make nunneries look like brothels. They're not forward-thinking enough to recognize that they'll be chiseling the lithography for their new chips onto stone tablets like fucking cavemen if Trump gets to continue having his way non-consensually with the American economy at current pace.  In short, I love to code. I love to solve problems. I love computers. But goddamn I fucking hate this industry. These people all so painfully stupid and evil. We could've had paradise. We could've had it all. Instead we got this. What a fucking shame.",HorseTeacherTess,2025-05-09T19:50:27,4

They won't even keep the jobs here for white collar.  Tech is a blood bath right now with Indian outsourcing. The amount of six figure jobs that have disappeared overseas the last 12-24 months is astonishing.,Knosh,2025-05-10T00:55:32,1
"^Ditto  It’s not just the tech heads, the current wave of “I can do anything” mentality bringing out the worst in some people.   Being great at specific tasks has lost value in the eyes of those who think AI can do it all for you. The overconfidence is incredibly cringy because what they manage to produce is so malformed to an expert on the topic.",decentusernamestaken,2025-05-09T21:40:04,2
