"Im conflicted on things like this. It’s pretty obvious this is something similar to “Birth Tourism”. I’d wager her wandering of the desert while 8 months pregnant was specifically so she could make it to US soil to have the baby be a US citizen. I generally agree with the concept of birthright citizenship, and even for the children of those who aren’t documented, but I think it’s a bit rich when individuals come here shortly before they are due seemingly specifically for the purpose of giving birth. There needs to be a pretty narrowly tailored law to prevent this.",P1xelHunter78,2025-05-04T07:15:18,12

"I don’t think the majority of people who come here do this, but there does need to be some law that prevents this. Like maybe you have to be in the country at least 2 months prior to birth or smtn",Massive-Grocery7152,2025-05-04T11:08:57,2
"I think you are correct that it’s more rare than considered, and some laws need to be in place. But the conservatives think it happens 200% of the time and would rather burn the whole house down just to get rid of a few mice.",AlllliillllA,2025-05-04T16:33:01,0
