No way there have been enough deportations yet to effect modelo sales significantly.,UltraAirWolf,2025-04-14T07:32:52,96
Iirc Modelo was the best selling beer in the country for a few years recently,Bmartin_,2025-04-14T07:49:59,16
Modelo got a sales bump after the Bud Light fiasco. This is probably just a return to normal.,The1Sundown,2025-04-14T05:22:47,106

An interesting side effect.  Wonder what the Freakonomics folks think about this correlation.,j3remy2007,2025-04-14T06:05:06,1
That explains the increase in Modelo commercials the last 4 years. Somebody was buying it.,social_dinosaur,2025-04-14T06:55:41,2
"Can't they just sell the beer someplace else then? Those people still exist, they're just *not here* anymore.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-16T16:28:51,1
I call this a bs story it replaced bud light for many across the country and consumes a huge section at food lion and Walmart here in North Carolina.   My problem you canâ€™t find negra modelo anywhere anymore.,jackdog20,2025-04-16T21:28:58,1

Odd.  I only ever see snooty white libs drinking Modelo.,letmeinfornow,2025-04-14T04:38:44,-14
Maybe peopleâ€™s taste buds just improved.,Crohn85,2025-04-14T08:53:20,-4
Not to mention plenty of pale walkers enjoy modelo myself one of them.  Deportation are a drop in the bucket in sales.,codifier,2025-04-14T08:35:28,35

"Aye, and Bud Light sales are back up. While I can see the pro-US sentiment having some effect, there's only so much market share to go around.Â ",WPWeasel,2025-04-14T06:14:34,24

Miller lite and high life truly arenâ€™t bad. I like lite more than mich golden and bud light. High life is decent. I still reach for Pabst blue ribbon(pbr) and hamms more often though. 5% and tasty for an American adjunct lager(AAL) and generally a dollar or more cheaper than the others. Not gut rot either.,Open-Chain-7137,2025-04-14T21:37:04,1
