Citizens are really going to miss all of the meaningful agencies and department these goons dismantled. These departments and agencies have taken 20-40-50 years to build. 90 days to lay waste to.   And Congress just sits there smiling. Why?,SBRH33,2025-04-26T13:46:48,67
">Look at the Congress. It currently has all the **relevance of**¬†[**Putin**](https://www.thetimes.com/topic/vladimir-putin)**‚Äôs Duma.** In three months, it has passed just five laws, and only one of any substance (enabling the government to deport an illegal alien if merely charged with, rather than convicted of, a crime). The Senate waved through all of Trump‚Äôs nominees, including Robert Kennedy Jr, the 21st-century version of Caligula‚Äôs horse.  >Compare that with his 130 executive orders ‚Äî a rate of 520 a year, if he keeps this up. Since JFK, no president has racked up more than an average of 80 a year. **But Trump rules by edict, and has no other way of operating. Executive orders differ from laws in that they are issued by the president and have the binding force of law but don‚Äôt need to be approved by Congress.¬†Many of these edicts are, naturally, unconstitutional. Many have been larded up, unlike any previous president‚Äôs, with sneering rhetoric more usually seen on X.**  If America dumbs down any more we are going to be totally irrelevant.  Impeach Trump, it's not like we don't have mountains of evidence of treason against the Constitution.",Brytnshyne,2025-04-26T14:32:43,42
