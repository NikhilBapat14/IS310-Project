"I’m one of thousands of Ukrainians who came to the U.S. legally under President Biden’s Uniting for Ukraine program. For over three months now, USCIS has quietly placed our work permit (EAD) and adjustment of status applications on “processing hold.” No updates. No transparency. No timeline.  They say “additional review.” But there’s no evidence of actual movement. It’s a full freeze. We cannot work, renew our documents, or survive independently. Some are already losing housing. Many are desperate.  This feels less like a review and more like quiet retaliation — punishing a Biden-era humanitarian program by letting it silently collapse. If this is political, the cruelty is deliberate. And Ukrainians — the very people this country promised to help — are paying the price.  Please help us get the attention of your representatives. Ask why this administration is leaving us in the dark. Life is not supposed to be on hold.",Cute_Matter5031,2025-04-30T14:29:14,1
