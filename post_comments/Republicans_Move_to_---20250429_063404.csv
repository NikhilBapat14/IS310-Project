">House Republicans are moving to block Democrats from being able to force votes on whether to demand information from President Donald Trump’s administration for the next six months.   ...   The move comes as Democrats push resolutions demanding answers about the Trump administration’s “Signalgate” leak scandal. One of the measures from Democrats, in the House Armed Services Committee, would demand that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth supply information about America’s attacks on the Youthis in Yemen, as well as information about rules governing how classified or sensitive information is handled at the Pentagon.   ...    Fresh off a two-week recess, House Republicans returned to Washington and advanced a measure in the Rules Committee Monday that would pause resolutions of inquiry until Sept. 30. This would effectively shut down efforts by Democrats to ask the Trump administration to share documents about Signalgate — or anything else for that matter.  >The proposed rule change was tucked into a package of resolutions designed to repeal several Biden-era environmental policies, including those allowing California to set more stringent vehicle pollution rules.",brain_overclocked,2025-04-29T12:07:38,8

"The CIA could not retrieve the messages.   Why? Because Sugnal is designed that way if **you decide** to **use** that feature in the system. When you use the feature it notifies everyone in the chat that it was activated. So everyone is aware the chat was set to be deleted in one week and they know that is not legal for government business.   I do not want to sound like a Republican but this is what Democrats do they hold theater to show how mad they are. Jan 6 Panel was a great example it accomplished what exactly? It cost how much money? All the people convicted are free, the perpetrators who sent those people to do the crime are free and running parts of the Government. We do not need hearings, thoughts, or talks. We need them to use the rules and laws to hold people accountable.   Government officials are allowed to use Signal because of Biden is where we left off. The Government is supposed to keep a record of the conversations that lead to things like dropping bombs. As we saw but would never have known if they had not been caught without the President his Administration used the word “deterrent” to drop bombs and has continued to drop bombs on Houthi targets and we learn:   - it might be an economic crisis but they could blame Biden  - it could wait but someone else might bomb them  - collateral damage is possible they announced some yesterday about Africans being killed.   - gas prices can be inflated but again they could blame Biden   Also the government is using NATO budget to pay for the attacks the suits are from the forward NATO command. This is why that “budget” is as high as it is. They use it for the side attacks and the US spends on NATO missions about the same as other nations, we just get to bury cost for other missions. It’s ironic to see Trump say we over spend in NATO and yet his is why.",Morepastor,2025-04-29T09:14:48,-12
