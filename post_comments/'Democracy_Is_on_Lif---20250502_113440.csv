"PBS CEO Paula Kerger took a pay package of over $1,000,000 in 2023 while COO Jonathan Barzilay took a meager $675,500. PBS reportedly expects  $373,400,000 in projected revenues for 2025.  You can read about Kerger‚Äôs history of giving out cushy board positions to her real estate partners here:  https://current.org/2010/05/pbs-entrusts-key-funding-job-to-good-friend-of-its-president/   NPR‚Äôs CEO Katherine Maher (daughter of a Goldman Sachs executive and Connecticut State Senator Ceci Maher) also took in over $1,000,000 in pay last year overseeing the company‚Äôs $336,000,000 revenue in 2024.

I think it's more like 0.01%.  Edit: I misread the previous comment as that they got 1% OF the federal budget. Parent is correct that only about 1% of NPR's budget comes from the federal government,LargeWu,2025-05-02T11:44:35,20

NPR gets 1% of its funding from the federal government. The majority of their funding is from corporate sponsorship and from listener donations . So yeah if you want to support these organizations the best thing you can do is donate to them.,AlexandersWonder,2025-05-02T15:21:33,2
