It was worth $220 in October 24.   Started rising after tRump was elected ($480) Then nosedive on January 20th. If it wasn't for elon it would be over $700 by now. It's not the markets fault it doesn't trust him anymore.,KRAZYKNIGHT,2025-03-31T20:51:46,2
There's no way Elon Musk isn't a Nazi. ,Former_Exam_103,2025-04-07T13:39:17,2
"Because the only requirement of his “job” is “have money” and despite his companies’ stocks going down the toilet faster than one of Trump’s five-flush-minimum shits, he still has an unholy amount of it.  He’d be far easier to fire if he was a real CEO who actually oversaw shit and not just an ATM fueled by ketamine and hatred that his employees placate, then ignore as much as possible.",HauntedHippie,2025-03-31T13:04:55,15
