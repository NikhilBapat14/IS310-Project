"> Some people on Wall Street say that we’re going to have the greatest economy in history. Why don’t you talk about them?   Because they don't exist.  >  If Trump’s tariffs succeeded at restoring America’s manufacturing prowess, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said a recession would be “worth it.”   There is zero chance that Trump's tariffs will bring back manufacturing on a meaningful scale. What company is stupid enough to invest a large amount of money in a multi-year plan to build a and equip a factory and organize all of the supply chain needs, when those tariffs will be gone before the factory can start production?    The only way it would work would be if there was strong bipartisan support for Trump's insanely stupid tariffs, and there isn't. There's zero chance a Democratic president would keep the tariffs. It's not even clear that a Republican successor to Trump would keep them. Trump himself will probably flip flop again before the year is out, maybe before the month is out.",KingKrasnov,2025-05-02T20:20:30,33

"He never articulates what we're even buying with his market crash. He never tells anyone what the benefit to any of us actually is.   Manufacturing jobs? That pay... what, exactly?

He would have been right if the US had actually prepared for the ""America First"" mindset by investing internally before aggressively killing off every international relationship we have in less than 6 months.
