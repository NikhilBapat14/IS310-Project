"From reporter Ben Blanchet:  Rep. Greg Casar (D-Texas) called out Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) on Wednesday after the DOGE subcommittee ‚Äî a panel she chairs under the House Oversight Committee ‚Äî held a hearing on transgender people in sports.  ‚ÄúWhat the hell are we doing here? Seriously?‚Äù asked Casar of the GOP-majority panel‚Äôs ‚ÄúUnfair Play: Keeping Men Out of Women‚Äôs Sports‚Äù hearing.  ‚ÄúWe are here because Chairwoman Marjorie Taylor Greene thinks that if she picks on vulnerable people like trans folks, she can avoid having a discussion about the allegations of insider trading against her.‚Äù  Link to the full article: [https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rep-greg-casar-marjorie-taylor-greene-trans-atheltes\_n\_681bef21e4b0794c7c965beb?utm\_medium=Social&utm\_source=reddit&utm\_campaign=us\_main](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rep-greg-casar-marjorie-taylor-greene-trans-atheltes_n_681bef21e4b0794c7c965beb?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=us_main)",huffpost,2025-05-07T20:54:24,243

Wish Harris stuck to the weird message. Republicans are really weird and not enough people know. Like these weirdos are so obsessed with other peoples genitals that they want to have genital inspectors in bathrooms.

"They love the chaos. Chaos is ""normal"". Normal is sad.  Being bored makes them depressed. As they seek out chaos to bring them pleasure. This depression prompts them to  contemplate life.   They are always on the wrong level.    Nothing is ever enough when you're like this.",RotterWeiner,2025-05-08T18:01:07,1
"Seeing as [Chair""person"" Greene resorted to defaming a subpoenaed witness by using a doctored photograph in her hearing](https://youtu.be/GNlZi3nJPUI?si=nLqgFysumkD4yU04&t=490), I think ""fixation"" is something of an understatement. ***Monomania***, referring to the mental illness, is much apropos of her disgusting behavior in the hearing.  The above linked video, in which a committee member calls Greene out on her seeming perjury (if her oath of office indeed serves to put her ""under oath"" in a legal sense) is precious! Greene displays a photo doctored to make the witness appear to be ""giving the finger"" to the committee while seemingly referring to his testimony as ""Game Day"". I think the video pretty much shows Greene personally distilling her own character to its pure malevolent essence.  \[Note:\] Be sure to watch her full scene in the snippet... you'll be glad you did!",phosdick,2025-05-09T10:54:07,1

"Lol, when I came out as trans to one of my childhood friends he dropped that him and his wife are swingers. They and a bunch of others rent out a whole hotel floor for orgies. I lost it and busted up laughing. Here I am worried and pouring out my soul, just to live life authenticity, yet cis white Indiana orgies aren‚Äôt on the ballet.   I don‚Äôt care as long as they are safe, not gross about it and leave my family alone. I don‚Äôt want my children learning about the behaviors of sexually repressed Christians until we have the birds/bees talk. But yeah more furries than trans and more sexually repressed religious folks than trans that the only outlet is honk if your horny bumper stickers. I think they should leave but I‚Äôm just one trans person feeling the hypocrisy.   Also I had way more questions than he did of me. Like was there a buffet? Themes? There has to be a Gatsby night or at least generic spy night. And if you are wondering if there was a furry night, there absolutely was.   The kingdom of heaven is within. The feeling of self righteousness doesn‚Äôt fulfill the ego, only balance and harmony within. The irony of attacking someone because they are seeking balance is insane but I understand because I am now balanced. I see their struggle to blame others because there‚Äôs comfort in self righteousness but it‚Äôs not a peaceful state. It‚Äôs one of projecting so your flaws or hotel orgy parties, insider trading aren‚Äôt discovered. They chase greed and power rather than balance.   Sorry had to vent.",PrincessRomi,2025-05-08T05:29:25,15

They want to give people enemies they can amplify to blame for the supposed degradation of society. They've already been going after furries a bit despite them being completely irrelevant.  Sometimes the groups they fearmonger about don't even need to exist. Look at the Satanic Panic in the 80s.,infinight888,2025-05-08T10:50:42,1
