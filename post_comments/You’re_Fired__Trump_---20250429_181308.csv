"We have a publicly funded museum for something that didn’t happen here and we didn’t do?  How American of us!  Edit: You can downvote all you want but still can’t cha be the facts. It didn’t happen here. We didn’t do it. We didn’t fight a war to stop it. It isn’t American history.  Interesting, we spend 67 million per year on it. It’s not some long established thing. It was founded in 1993 and not publicly supported until 2000. https://www.ushmm.org/m/pdfs/USHMM-FY2024-Presidents-Budget.pdf",Bamfor07,2025-04-29T19:18:00,-175

We did however liberate a lot of camps and the artifacts brought back are probably substantial. Its also a key event in history that should be remembered and preserved to prevent something like that happening again. Publicly funded part aside its something that we should have. Just because Ww2 happened over seas doesn't mean every ww2 memorial and museum is stupid or has no significance to the american people. The only reason I can really justify the public funding part is the government is going to be around way longer than anyone else and isn't going to get dismantled when the original curator dies and has no one to pass the torch to.,Katzchen12,2025-04-29T19:34:32,111
Maybe you should look at pictures of the Japanese that were released from our own internment camps here in the states. We literally starved them. It’s fucked up,Zachmode,2025-04-29T21:52:18,110

"The United States having holocaust memorials would be like Japan having a memorial for the Trail of Tears. ""Funny"" how it works out this way.",HastingsIV,2025-04-29T22:25:29,-31
"It’s history, just not American history. It didn’t happen here. We didn’t do it. We didn’t fight a war to stop it.   World war 2 was not about the holocaust.   I’m not taking anything away from the holocaust or its importance in world history. It just isn’t American history and therefore I question public funding.  https://www.ushmm.org/m/pdfs/USHMM-FY2024-Presidents-Budget.pdf",Bamfor07,2025-04-29T19:38:32,-85
">We did however liberate a lot of camps   The thing about that is Americans are never honored for their sacrifices in doing so.  For example, look up the web page for the US holocaust memorial and see if you can find a single reference to American liberators on the front page.",ChristopherRoberto,2025-04-29T22:38:30,-26
"The Holocaust is HUMAN history, the absolute worst humanity is capable of. Everyone on the planet should be aware of the event and learn from it, as not to ever repeat it..",Grouchy_Map7133,2025-04-30T13:11:28,1
"No ww2 was not about the holocaust but it was again, I will reiterate, an american story. Or at least it has several different perspectives from the american side whether again, refugee, survivor, or liberator. We as a nation also provided aid and relief to survivors and as far as I'm concerned that alone should be curated so our story can be told to generations.  Either way most of these museums still heavily rely on donations and the public funding is a drop in an overwhelming large in comparison bucket. This is probably one of the few reasons I can call myself a moderate rather than full blown conservative as again this is something that the government can and has done better than any private collection.  I'm all for cutting budgets but this isn't something that is wise to do, along with any other museums budget.",Katzchen12,2025-04-29T20:18:05,71
"I disagree a tangential association of ours to Central/Eastern European history is a compelling purpose for expending federal funds—67 million BTW.  It’s also a recent development, only opening in 1993 so it’s hard to see it as too profound or deeply rooted.",Bamfor07,2025-04-29T20:20:05,-54
