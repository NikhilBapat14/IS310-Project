"During an on-camera Oval Office meeting with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, whom the Trump administration has paid to imprison immigrants deported from the United States it claims without evidence are gang members, President Donald Trump deferred to Attorney General Pam Bondi, who said the decision was Bukele’s.  “That’s up to El Salvador if they want to return him. That’s not up to us,” Bondi told reporters. “That’s not up to us. If they want to return him, we would facilitate it, meaning provide a plane.” Bukele, for his part, called Abrego Garcia a “terrorist,” [saying to a reporter](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3lmrwrrkbnf2e) who asked if he would return him, “I hope you’re not suggesting that I smuggle a terrorist into the United States.” He added, “The question is preposterous.”  The bad faith of this exchange is obvious. Bukele has the power to free Abrego Garcia and send him back to the U.S. on an American plane without “smuggling” anyone or anything. But neither side wants that outcome, and so they are both pretending that it’s the other’s responsibility. It’s a game both sides are in on.",PapyrusKami74,2025-04-14T22:00:31,77
How does a ‘Sh—hole’ country’s president show up on US soil and brag that he’s going to ignore US law? And a U.S. president lets him say that in his presence???,mbw70,2025-04-14T23:22:45,56

"Archive link  https://archive.is/p85mH  Edit: Something we need to keep in mind. Abrego is the only clerical error **the administration has admitted to but certainly not the only clerical error made.** Here are a couple of examples: ICE copy pasted another person's information into man's file, man deported for having a soccer tattoo honoring Real Madrid, man deported for autism awareness tattoo.... There are definitely endless stories like this.  https://immigrationimpact.com/2025/04/03/men-deported-el-salvador-stories-investigation/  Here's a case of another man wrongly sent with papers signed by a fired crooked cop who now works for the outsourced detention centers: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2025/04/10/fired-milwaukee-police-officer-report-gay-stylist-salvadoran-prison/83005721007/  So please keep in mind this is about far more people than just Abrego. Him alone coming home (if he does) is not a win. It's simply Trump holding off being pulled out of power for one more day. Of course him getting released and brought back to the US would be fantastic, but these are basically POWs of war that we cannot forget about until they all come home.   This is also a crucial read: [I’m the Canadian who was detained by Ice for two weeks.

"Guys stop, that guy is already dead. This isn’t a power play. They can’t send him back because he is already dead. El Salvador isn’t holding these people, they are killing them. The nazi’s did the same thing, it’s why the camps were barely in Germany. The worst were in Poland. Trump has partnered with a foreign dictator to kill people for the United States. Period.   We need stop talking about this in the way we want to so we don’t have to come to grips with the fact that the United States is sending human beings abroad to be murdered.   It’s not a prison, it’s not a concentration camp, it’s a death camp and we need to say that. ",Ashamed_Job_8151,2025-04-15T00:53:54,8
