"Because the sides are far enough part that ANY candidate is polarizing.  Biden isn't someone that would historically be considered 'polarizing',  he's only polarizing because the Republicans make a point of demonizing their opponents.  Biden is quite moderate already, selecting a moderate doesn't really help.  Another factor is that elections are often less about swing voters choosing which side to vote for than about whether the voters on your side show up at all.  If you pick a more centrist candidate, then some of the voters on your farther fringe, while they wouldn't vote for the opposing candidate, they may choose to simply not vote at all; and the net effect of that is stronger.  Another factor is the nature of the primary system means that winning the primary is also a significant factor; many primary voters do not vote based on long-term strategic considerations, but based on which candidate they prefer themselves.  As to why the Republicans stick with Trump?  Some sort of shared delusional madness.  Also, anyone who turns against Trump gets shunned by the rest of the party and loses their career.  On the Dem side, there's a significant incumbency advantage, and people don't want to give up the incumbency advantage by picking someone else.  Also there's no clear top or favored alternative, so if it were to be left open it'd be a messy and questionable fight which would take a lot of resources.  By avoiding that fight they can save all their campaign resources for the general election.",zlefin_actual,2023-06-28T19:59:28,13
">  For example, if Republican just choose a candidate that Democrats won't vehemently vote against, then they should swing enough votes to win the presidency. Same goes for the Democrats side  That's what the Democrats did by choosing Biden. They had the option of populist firebrand (Sanders), but chose Biden because the voters thought he was more moderate and therefore more electable. And, make no mistake, Biden truly was the establishment, moderate, centrist politician, and he has angered the left flank of his party by not acting as an extremist to pack the Supreme Court, unilaterally expunge the debt ceiling, expand the Senate, etc.  The puzzle here, however, is that there are not actually that many 'persuable' voters in the centre of the US electorate. If you choose a moderate, you risk losing the excitement and energy of people likely to participate, vote, and donate. Run someone too extreme, and you get too broad and strong a coalition against you.   The other risk with the moderate choice is that negative messaging can transform the image of a moderate into an extremist, negating a theoretical advantage. Voters perceived Trump as being more moderate than Clinton because the messaging painting her as extreme was successful; likewise, Romney was also a moderate, centre-leaning candidate, but Democratic messaging framed him as a socially regressive misogynist. Given the levels of partisanship, voters who lean in the other direction are unlikely to differentiate between the moderate and extremist in the opposite party.",Cleomenes_of_Sparta,2023-06-28T21:13:00,4

"The polarizing figures end up in the general election because the primary process encourages playing up to your base rather than the wider electorate. In America candidates for general elections, the elections where offices are actually decided, are chosen from candidates within political parties by their members in a separate election that comes before it it called the primary election.  Apparently in many other nations, the electorate have no say in who the political party puts forth as their candidate in elections so you don't have these sorts of issues visible. In America we vote for individual candidates, not parties and the parties themselves have no ability to gatekeep who is able to run under their banner.",JudgeWhoOverrules,2023-06-28T19:53:49,2
Cause the real people controlling us will only give us the choices they want. I like Kennedy over Biden. Biden can not even have a conversation at this point. Basically a puppet. He can not even finish a sentence and make sense at this point. So let’s get some new blood in there and someone that loves this country.,ItsafrenchyThing,2023-06-29T09:16:36,-1
"Biden was the worst candidate on the democratic ticket. He only won the primary because Bloomberg massively overfunded him compared to every other candidate. The courts have upheld the DNC’s right to more or less skew things in favor of the candidate THEY want, regardless of anything resembling democracy. In the mainstream left, while much progress can be made in terms of rights, balancing inequality, the environment, healthcare, citizens united, etc… none of these things are seriously tabled as objectives. They could have ratified the Equal Rights Amendment and had the opportunity to do so, and that might have helped shape precedent in a number of areas, but there’s more incentive to keep people at odds with one another. The mainstream left is playing a war of attrition, where they are aware of the consequences of climate change, but really only the top 10 percent of earners have any protections in place. To avoid actually having to serve the broader public at large, progress is stalled on everything else. The democrats model isn’t democratic. At best, they’re shooting for something more like singapore, which is more of a ceremonial democracy with no actual power.   The right has been playing the accelerationist strategy when it comes to climate change. This benefits many individuals and industries. Aside from that, their strategy has been obstructionist and regressive. As the democrats have largely become the conservatives in the room, the right wing has been pushing to extremes. This combination has the side effect of locking progressives out. The democrats can just point at this and not have the expectation on them to actually improve anything as things begin to collapse.   Banks, Oil companies, weapon companies, media companies, all have a stake in perpetuating this stalemate. This is why we can’t have nice things.",nearmyst,2023-12-26T14:29:32,1
"i think that makes sense. imo the polarizing part about Biden is his age and his mental capacity. From what I seen, Democrats honestly don't like Biden that much and they're also realizing he is getting too old. How does it make sense for Biden to be candidate when any other Democrats should on paper have an easy win over someone like Trump?  I'm really simplifying it but looks like we got people that only vote trump, people that will never vote trump, people that are tired of trump but don't want another Biden term due to his age. Pick another candidate and that's auto 2/3 of the votes.",TZ1205,2023-06-28T20:01:46,-1
">That's what the Democrats did by choosing Biden. They had the option of populist firebrand (Sanders), but chose Biden because the voters thought he was more moderate and therefore more electable.  It's also important to remember that prior to Super Tuesday (March 3rd, 2020), Biden and Sanders were neck-and-neck. The other decent candidates dropped out of the race before Super Tuesday and endorsed Biden to avoid splitting the moderate vote and letting Sanders run away with the primary. Buttigieg, Klobuchar, and O'Rourke all dropped early March and endorsed Biden to help him secure a Super Tuesday win and the eventual nomination.  Had the GOP employed a similar strategy in 2016, they might have gotten someone other than Trump.",ProLifePanda,2023-06-29T08:46:07,2
"i think that can explain why someone like Trump will become the Republican candidate but it doesn't explain why Biden should be chosen though.

"Most of the people that aren't fond of another Biden term due to his age will still end up voting for him, so it's no really an auto 2/3 votes.  You're simply mis-estimating the size of the various groups.  In particular the 3rd group you describe has almost no actual people in it most likely; and losses in turnout amongst other support bases could easily counteract such effects.  Trump's mental capacity issues are considerably worse than Biden's and he still has plenty of support.    It makes sense for Biden to be candidate because they can't agree WHICH other candidate should go against Trump, and no-one is an obvious choice; and the incumbency advantage really is significant.  Just because 'on paper' someone should be an easy win over Trump doesn't mean it will be.  Hillary should've been an easy win over Trump on paper, but she didn't win.  So the Dems can't rely on 'should be an easy win' against Trump.",zlefin_actual,2023-06-28T20:39:01,9
">imo the polarizing part about Biden is his age and his mental capacity.  It doesn't really matter now, does it? No matter who you put up there, there will be SOMETHING polarizing against them. Name me a candidate and I'll name what's polarizing about them.  >How does it make sense for Biden to be candidate when any other Democrats should on paper have an easy win over someone like Trump?  Two things. First, Biden isn't the candidate. He announced his intention to run. Other Democrats are free to challenge him and win in the primary. Second, the incumbency edge is VERY hard to overcome. Incumbents generally do very well, and you need a GOOD reason to knock them off their mantle (especially in the primary stage). People will generally default to the incumbent.",ProLifePanda,2023-06-29T08:36:59,2
