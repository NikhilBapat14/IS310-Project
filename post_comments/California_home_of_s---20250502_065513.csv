You cannot Dox law enforcement.  They wear badges with numbers because you are supposed to know who they are.  If revealing the identities of law enforcement is interfering with law investigations then there is no accountability for the individual.,Bigbeardhotpeppers,2025-05-02T07:03:09,43

"Oh let me try that headline format myself Fox News...  *California home of suspect accused of eating cupcakes raided and searched*  *California home of suspect accused of taking pictures of sunsets raided and searched*  *California home of suspect accused of daydreaming raided and searched*  There is noting illegal about what he's doing which is why there were no arrests.    So, lets write a true headline:  *Feds Face Accusations of Intimidation after Raiding Home of ICE Protestor.*",thingsorfreedom,2025-05-02T07:17:45,7

I did not enjoy linking them but it was the first major outlet I could find covering the story (and I didn’t want to try fighting with the approved domain filter 10 different times)   Found some others covering it now  https://migrantinsider.com/p/ice-deploys-armored-convoy-to-arrest  http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/federal-agents-raid-irvine-turtle-rock-doxxing-investigation,Zen1,2025-05-02T07:25:10,0

"You don't ""pay"" them.  Congress takes your money by fiat and appropriated those money for them.  In this day and age you can't assume Congress is acting in good faith.",thieh,2025-05-02T07:36:31,-1
"There is a very short window that hiding their identities are going to give them cover, that window is closing now.  Without accountability for law enforcement and the right of due process it will get more dangerous to be a law enforcement agent.  The state has a monopoly on violence because we allow them under the condition that they will manage malfeasance, if that is not happening then they have broken the agreement.  All of these punisher  guys need to understand that no one wants to commit violence on them, this is America for better or worse we love the cops (as a whole, ACAB), but if they keep not being held accountable by the state they will be held accountable by the people.",Bigbeardhotpeppers,2025-05-02T07:16:57,6
"If they own a house it is public record, if you give me your name I bet I can find your phone number, address, and even your parents information.  SSN is the only private information you listed and that is not doxing that is identity theft.  Good try though.     Doxing is taking a private and/or anonymous person and posting their information because not being private anymore is the punishment the doxer is seeking.  Law enforcement by definition are not private citizens.  You can not dox law enforcement.",Bigbeardhotpeppers,2025-05-02T07:43:24,6

"Not a lawyer, but if it's applicable to FOIA Exemption 6, expect it would be a reasonable case for a civil suit:  ""Exemption (b)(6) prohibits the disclosure of any record which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy such as information found in personnel and medical files.  Examples of exemption 6 records are performance appraisals; records on an employee's medical condition, history, and test results; personally identifiable information such as name, social security number, military service number, home address and telephone number, age, place and date of birth, etc.; and payroll information such as number of deductions, number of withholding exemptions, and net wages.""  Good try though.  EDIT: Could also fall under FOIA exemption 7c too.   Short answer. Is it illegal? Likely no. Could you reasonably be successfully sued? Absolutely.",Geek_Ken,2025-05-02T10:16:01,1
"Man you literally have no idea what you are talking about.  You just want to be right.    FOIA is when you request information from the government.  Those are the rules of what the government can and cannot supply to the public under a FOIA request.  It has nothing to do with what the general public can post anywhere. If you buy a house, the owner of the house is written down in the town records, it is public information, the rest of the information you listed is volunteered by the individual via the internet, facebook, subscription service, etc.  Posting that information that can be googled is not doxxing.       You are not a lawyer, and you don't understand basic concepts like who the law binds in this case it binds the government not any of us.  Your comment is completely irrelevant, not on topic.",Bigbeardhotpeppers,2025-05-02T10:24:42,1
