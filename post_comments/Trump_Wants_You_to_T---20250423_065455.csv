That’s exactly why resistance matters - authoritarianism thrives on apathy. The moment we believe it's futile is the moment they win. Stay loud. Stay stubborn. History doesn’t remember the quiet ones.,This_Sign_1133,2025-04-23T07:02:57,217
"Healthy democracies rely on independent media to keep the public informed, an independent legal profession to maintain the rule of law, independent universities to guard objective truth and provide forums for dissent to authority, and independent State and Local governments to counterbalance a powerful Federal government.  Trump's regime is attacking independent media, law firms, universities, and State and Local governments that don't bend the knee and pledge unquestioning loyalty.  When despots are consolidating their power and dismantling our democracy, you have to find out if you will accept the situation you're in. Either let that become the new normal, or do something. And with that risk everything.",Truthisnotallowed,2025-04-23T06:56:28,225

"The resistance needs to be responsibly pro-2A.   I am beyond tired of being told Trump is America’s Hitler (he is) while being told we should not own guns or seeing bills trying to ban semiautomatic rifles.   Go after full automatic, sure.

But it was mostly completed in less time than that.  You can see that for yourself by looking at the German federal elections of March 1933.    A closer look at that election reveals the fallacy popular on Reddit that state control over elections protects us from that result in 2026. Because it was not just NAZI government control that produced the big win for the fascists in that election, it was violent threats and intimidation of voters and dissidents that produced it.  With the police and the justice department on his side Trump will easily be able to do the same thing to the American election in 2026.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-23T08:26:01,2

No one decided to support Trump because they made a rational, informed decision about what is best for the country. So we aren't going to reason them out of an opinion they did not reason themselves into. All they have is feelings, and we need to make them feel stupid and weak for supporting such a stupid and weak president.

"I think everyone can contribute in their own way. For some, that may be holding up signs at a protest; for others, that might mean walking friends and family off the MAGA ledge.  It's crucial that the 2028 midterm elections be free, fair, and competitive, so in my opinion, raising awareness up to the midterms is necessary but insufficient if Trump has already consolidated power enough by then. Congress could still, at least hypothetically, hold the administration accountable and pass laws, even overriding the president's veto, to check Trump's excesses. What would motivate Republican members to roll off the Trump train before then so that Congress can do its job? This would seem to take analyzing members of Congress's motivations individually:  * Do they actually care about winning the midterms? If they're in a reliably Republican-voting district or state, maybe not so much, but also, if they believe ""the fix is in,"" that in itself would be telling. * Is there some greater ideal that would actually motivate them to break from Trump: the Constitution, democracy, freedom, maybe values derived from their faith? * Are they motivated by ambition and see that ambition being rewarded by staying loyal to Trump? * Are they motivated by fear: fear of ""retribution"" or fear of blackmail? * Is it their investment portfolio they care about? * Are they just MAGA ideologues?  It would seem to require persuading moderate and even more reasonable conservative voters this all isn't right or American because, if the constitutional crisis comes to a head, it would take a much larger and more significant kind of non-violent protest.",matthedev,2025-04-24T12:18:26,1

"I think you're being quite disingenuous here. The goal of every protest isn't *just* to force change, it's also to bring awareness to the issue and make it a concern. Those protests changed the language of politics and spurred all sorts of secondary changes. For instance, we regularly refer to the 99% and the 1%, politicians are regularly quoted as saying ""Black Lives Matter"". Those terms didn't enter the zeitgeist on their own.  We also saw results in other forms, such as we did when the women's march was followed by the #MeToo movement and multiple high profile sexual assault cases and convictions. BLM made gains in a [number of areas](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/black-lives-matter-at-10-years-what-impact-has-it-had-on-policing/), such as the fact that body cams on cops are pretty much common across the country now.  So no, I don't think these protests are just about making noise and I absolutely think they'll have an effect on not just our politics, but public opinion, legislation, and any number of unpredictable consequences.",schm0,2025-04-23T12:39:47,2
"Ah, its the Roof.  I would almost say that the protests did not fail entirely. They did manage to get government people talking, some small action taken on more local levels.  I view it as, what failed was, yet again, the electorate.  Our electorate is enthralled by accelerationists: the spoiled swine of America got enchanted by internet speed, and demanded that happen in reality. On both sides.  All of the protests you listed had a component of a minority that objected loudly to them, and then voted to make sure the government was staffed by people who also objected. Woefully, progressives did not make an eighth of the congressional progress that the right wing did.  We have been ruled by a toxic minority in this country for a long while now.  Edit to add: You are right though, in one of your points you call a protest a party because people are bringing their kids.

"Just to illustrate how completely Trump has Co-opted democratic powers and taken Fascistic power for himself - so far this year the Congress has passed only two bills and three continuing resolutions - in four months.  They have totally abdicated their power to make laws.  While, Trump, in his first 90 days wrote 130 executive orders - orders which are not supposed to have the power of laws, but anyone who disobeys, is subject to having their funding cut, their jobs eliminated, their schools closed, their broadcast licenses revoked, or maybe they will just be disappeared to a prison cell in a foreign country without a trial?  Even the tariffs - on virtually every country in the world (except Russia of course) - those are not being done to balance trade.  If Trump wanted to balance trade he would not be sabotaging most of the U.S. primary sources of export income - like Tourism and selling world class educations to foreign students.  What Trump really wants the tariffs for is to force every major private corporation to bend the knee to him or be forced out of business when their competitors get tariff exemptions and they do not.

I think if people in the wider non-political culture, comedians or just regular celebrities with a platform, just start treating it as a matter of fact thing that you have to be stupid to want Trump to be president, I think it might break through, at least to the non die hard MAGAs.

But if they start seeing more and more people make fun of how incredibly stupid and weak Trump is, he is objectively too stupid and weak to do the job, that might make them feel weak and stupid, which is how they should feel. And I think we should use the reality TV line, just not in quite the same way you would.   People, not anyone associated in any way with the Democratic party, should talk more about how we would all react if Kim Kardashian decided to run for president because the ratings for her show were slipping, but then a bunch of moron liberals took her seriously and she accidentally made it all the way to the White House, despite being utterly unqualified and unprepared for the job. We would bully the shit out of all the idiots who fell for that shit and voted for a vapid reality TV star to lead the nation, and that's what we should be doing to Trump supporters, because that is literally how Trump became president.

That still sounds like wishful thinking. A pep talk to yourself. My position is that protests don't work in the 21st century.    We need action to get rid of Trump not protests.   No one is proposing a plan of action and if we had one we have no leaders to lead us in that action.     Have you why the Germans just rolled over when Hitler became Chancellor?  Have you ever wondered why the Italians just rolled over when Mussolini became Il Duce?    If you live in America look around: In those countries the opposition had no strong leaders and no plan of action.  The opposition was weak and divided and didn't know what to do so they did nothing. That's what's happening in America right now.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-23T12:16:12,2

Right now the only real action is in the courts.    Already several of Doge's cuts have been restored or blocked because of court rulings.   So far those are just a drop in the bucket but there are literally hundreds of current cases in progress.    Lawsuits cost money and so far I've contributed over $1000 to ACLU and it's only April.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-23T13:29:28,-1

" I didn't say do nothing. I said do something that you can demonstrate actually **works**.   Protesting does not work. Pick something that you can show actually works.    As I pointed out we've actually won several court cases where people's jobs and projects' funding have actually been restored.   They are just a drop in the bucket but they are among the few concrete examples of beating Trump. There are **hundreds** of other cases currently in progress.    So if you want to do something that has been shown to actually work then contribute to a legal defense fund or to a group like the ACLU, or if you don't have any money do volunteer work for a legal defense fund or the ACLU.     It's much more boring than going to a demonstration but it's got a better track record.
