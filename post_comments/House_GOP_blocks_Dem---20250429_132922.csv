"America is 250 years old; there are nations on this Earth that are thousands of years old and they're still bickering over petty shit.   Instead of saying we DON'T, let's just say we MIGHT someday and simultaneously accept the fact that we're alive to see what historians will someday call a really shitty period in American history.",Background_Home7092,2025-04-30T03:16:12,8
"Where I live there are lots of MAGAs who love the idea of martial law. Even though Massachusetts is a very liberal place every time one of the police departments around here gets some new kind of tactical vehicle and show it off on the 4th of July or something, there are long lines of people who just want to see it and touch it.   Kids especially seem to be into it.     Our future is much more dystopian than our present, as bad as it is.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-29T20:58:10,5
"_I expect elected officials to uphold the law, represent their constituents, and protect the interests of the United States._   It would be nice if we lived in a timeline where that was a reasonable expectation. But unfortunately we don't live in that timeline. In this timeline it's naive to expect that.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-29T20:55:28,1
You expect too much. The allure of power is too strong for most to ignore.,LordSiravant,2025-04-29T21:34:59,1

"For real.   The (republican) people and representatives led us here and tried their damndest to cement this and NOW they're not republicans?  Through southern strategy, dissolving of various care and support agencies, redlining, medical/economic/social/political lies, obstructionism, constant demonizing of others, literal terrorism, dismantling common sense, and creating both an Orweillian nightmare and a constitutional crisis?  NOW MAGA isn't one of you?  Anything to cover for their mistakes and avoid accountability.  This is exactly the kind of finger twiddling, hair splitting behavior that needs severe punishment.  The fuck outta here.  It's too late for any republican to ever, EVER try to seek shelter or flee this.  They demanded it.  They can live with it.  Or they can take their own age old advice - don't like it?  Leave.  ...if anyone will still take them.",FluffyKittenHorde,2025-04-29T22:05:21,5

I can accept i made my statement poorly. They're against the previous establishment. The GOP has been pushing to deregulate almost all forms of government oversight. At the same time they act to undermine the functions of government. This leads to the government being viewed as ineffective. Kind of like if your kid thought they breaking one toy will get it replaced with something better. In this case the toy is our system of government and they want to replace it with one they want.,AdventurousNecessary,2025-04-29T17:45:37,5
"Congress is designed to have ambition check ambition, their greed and desire for power is SUPPOSED to be apart of how it all works. But that is not happening bc out representatives are all old, and cowardly unwilling to fulfill the roll they have been elected to do.",SoUnga88,2025-04-29T21:40:10,1
