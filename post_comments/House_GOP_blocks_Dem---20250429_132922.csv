"For real.   The (republican) people and representatives led us here and tried their damndest to cement this and NOW they're not republicans?  Through southern strategy, dissolving of various care and support agencies, redlining, medical/economic/social/political lies, obstructionism, constant demonizing of others, literal terrorism, dismantling common sense, and creating both an Orweillian nightmare and a constitutional crisis?  NOW MAGA isn't one of you?  Anything to cover for their mistakes and avoid accountability.  This is exactly the kind of finger twiddling, hair splitting behavior that needs severe punishment.  The fuck outta here.  It's too late for any republican to ever, EVER try to seek shelter or flee this.  They demanded it.  They can live with it.  Or they can take their own age old advice - don't like it?  Leave.  ...if anyone will still take them.",FluffyKittenHorde,2025-04-29T22:05:21,5

I can accept i made my statement poorly. They're against the previous establishment. The GOP has been pushing to deregulate almost all forms of government oversight. At the same time they act to undermine the functions of government. This leads to the government being viewed as ineffective. Kind of like if your kid thought they breaking one toy will get it replaced with something better. In this case the toy is our system of government and they want to replace it with one they want.,AdventurousNecessary,2025-04-29T17:45:37,5
