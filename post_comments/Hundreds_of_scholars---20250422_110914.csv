Hundreds of scholars also say that pot of boiling water on my stove is swiftly heading to towards boiling,markroth69,2025-04-22T11:14:11,43
"yeah hundreds of scholars are saying it now... but a lot of us have been watching this slow-motion collapse for years. trump just made it loud. the moves toward authoritarianism didn‚Äôt start with him, and they‚Äôre not gonna end when he‚Äôs gone.  look at the pattern. it‚Äôs not just executive overreach ‚Äî it‚Äôs coordinated decay. surveillance normalized after 9/11. whistleblowers treated like enemies of the state. militarized police. unaccountable alphabet agencies. every president since bush has expanded the power of the office. the media frames it like a partisan issue, but it‚Äôs deeper than that.  project 2025 is just the next phase. you centralize power, remove dissenters, label critics as threats to national security... all while pretending it‚Äôs about ‚Äúrestoring order.‚Äù textbook move. we‚Äôve seen this play out in other countries, but americans still think they‚Äôre immune because we‚Äôve got eagles and flags and freedom songs.  truth is, the scholars are right. we‚Äôre sliding fast. but it didn‚Äôt happen overnight. it happened because people were too busy blaming each other to notice the ground shifting under their feet.  you don‚Äôt get out of this by voting harder. you get out by waking up before the curtain fully drops.",Famous-Garlic3838,2025-04-22T11:15:43,18

"Definitely interesting, but the survey was done from January 31-February 10. The trend (and majority) said we were sliding into authoritarianism but could recover.  Well, Trump had only been in office for 11-20 days at that point. What about now? Next week will be Day 100. They say they want to do another survey. Hopefully, another one will come out soon.  If we were ""sliding"" into it by Day 20, they should definitely have something far, far worse to say now.",FIlm2024,2025-04-22T11:31:54,3

"That's because that's what Republicans want. 2 classes, rich+making all decisions, dirt poor+no choices left. It was always going to happen, they just found their idiot sooner than expected.  Of course the country would implode, it wouldn't go peacefully into the night. This isn't the USSR turning into 'modern Russia' where it's basically the same. They're actively ripping apart systems that people have paid into and helped pay forward because that's what successful civilizations need to do. And Republicans are sitting back and watching it all happen.  Some Dems are at least getting out there and spreading the message in places it needs to be spread, but Republicans control EVERYTHING right now... And this is what they chose to do. They know it will be hard to win future elections after this, so they're doing their best to make sure 'elections' have little to no power anymore.",The_River_Is_Still,2025-04-22T14:14:55,0
