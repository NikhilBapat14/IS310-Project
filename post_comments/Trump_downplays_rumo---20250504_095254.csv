"It‚Äôs not Constitutional.   The US Constitution can be amended through a process outlined in Article V, involving both Congress and state legislatures. An amendment can be proposed by either a two-thirds vote in both houses of Congress, or by a convention called for by two-thirds of the state legislatures. Once proposed, it requires ratification by three-fourths of the states, either through their legislatures or conventions.   How is this EVER going to happen? It WON‚ÄôT ever happen.",Lifeisagreatteacher,2025-05-04T09:58:03,599

Every time people cry about this sub being flaired users only I want to point them to this thread and show just how hard liberals come here to brigade and can't do anything but blanket downvote everything instead.

"The left seriously believes that Trump will do this might have to do with their belief that the Constitution is a ""living document"" that can be ignored at will.

No shit. He‚Äôs doing this so he doesn‚Äôt give into the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a lame duck president‚Äù narrative. It also keeps other Republicans from announcing their candidacy and taking the focus off the current admin,TheYoungLung,2025-05-04T11:04:30,-48

"Obama changed the definition of ""deport"" to include ""voluntary returns"", aka people caught at the border and returned to Mexico immediately. The actual number of interior deportations dropped significantly over his Presidency.  Even even left wing fact checker Snopes doesn't deny that. https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/obama-deported-more-people/  Although they leave out this quote from one of their source articles:  ‚ÄúIf you are a run-of-the-mill immigrant here illegally, your odds of getting deported are close to zero ‚Äî it‚Äôs just highly unlikely to happen,‚Äù John Sandweg, until recently the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said in an interview.  https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-obama-deportations-20140402-story.html",DrStevenPoop,2025-05-04T11:51:29,24

"At that rate he‚Äôd only deport about 1.5 million by the end of his term. Absolutely abysmal compared to how many we have in the country.
