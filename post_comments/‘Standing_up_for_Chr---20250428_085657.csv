"I guess hitting all the points of textbook fascism is Christian value. Good to know. Stay away from cults, kids.  Fascism is a far-right, authoritarian political ideology that emphasizes strong nationalism, and often a dictatorial leader. It typically involves suppression of political opposition, control over the media, use of propaganda, glorification of the state and militarism, rejection of democracy and individual rights, and scapegoating of perceived enemies, often based on race, ethnicity, or ideology.",theassassintherapist,2025-04-28T09:04:41,5
"The real shit people don't want to openly admit is white evangelicals always score the highest in poll categories around white grievances. So Trump actually won white evangelical's devotion way back when he went on every media outlet to scream that the nations first black president was illegitimate because he wasn't 'one of us'. That's why they think he 'speaks the 'truth', because for white evangelicals and conservatives the ""truth"" is non-white/christian/hetro people deserve to 'ruled over' by white evangelicals not share in society equally.  And they've done this before. White Evangelicals HATED the very religious Carter all because had directed the IRS to tell them they needed to integrate their whites only segregation academies or loose their tax exemptions. Carter had actually taken steps to reduce abortions and Reagan had signed the one of the most liberal abortion laws as governor. But while Reagan never really spoke about abortion during the campaign, he sure as hell did tell them the IRS would 'never do that again' under him, so evangelicals supported him because that's what they really cared about, segregation and white supremacy. Hell that's why abortion is even a thing we have to fight over. The evangelical response to Carter making them desegregate was for evangelical segregationist to form the 'moral majority' and build a base of power. They just slapped “Abortion"" on the protest signs as a cover story for the racism all the way down with white evangelicals.  So yea that's why they love Trump and also think Jesus was white, they're mostly just bigots.",TheCaptainDamnIt,2025-04-28T09:46:52,5

">Adam Russell Taylor, the president of Sojourners, a Christian social justice group, said such remarks remind him of “the prophet Isaiah, who forewarned us that woe to you that call evil, good, and good, evil”. > >The administration is “making these allegations that aren’t backed up by evidence or proof. And they disparage this whole body of work that has created such goodwill around the world and is so aligned with our Christian values,” Russell Taylor said. > >But many American evangelicals continue to support Trump despite such cuts, because concern for the poor “always takes a back seat in evangelical politics to abortion [and] control of the supreme court, which will allow them to have the religious freedom that they want”, said Fea, the history professor.  It's pretty clear that those who are christian in both professed belief as well as practice generally have an understanding of the problematic aspects of this administration. However, a good number of those who don't have a good understanding of their religion (or who frankly don't care about the details) appear to be more likely to overlook any deficiencies or contradictions. These people could more rightly be considered christians of convenience more than anything else.",Hrmbee,2025-04-28T09:12:34,2
