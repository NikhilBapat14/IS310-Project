"Having a ""daunting map"" after the carnage the Republicans are enacting is insane.",Zeta411North,2025-05-06T11:33:39,20
"The two biggest things they needed are happening: Thom Tillis looks incredibly vulnerable in a primary and Brian Kemp is sitting it out.  That’s the (second) easiest pickup and hardest seat to defend with circumstances both trending their way.    Bigger picture, the path to the Senate goes through Maine, North Carolina, and two of Ohio, Florida, Texas, and Iowa.  It’s daunting (Trump won all four of those by at least ten points), but you can find helpful extant circumstances in all four.   Husted is running as an appointed Senator in a special election, ditto Moody (with the added bonus of a brewing public corruption scandal involving Ron DeSantis).  John Cornyn is going through an absolutely nasty primary with Ken Paxton, which he might very well lose, and Iowa is going to be disproportionally affected if the trade war goes on much longer.",ScotTheDuck,2025-05-06T11:29:08,8
"Also think that WV might not be a lost cause.  It’s only recently gone Deep Red.  Before Justice, Manchin was a Democrat (at least in name) and Justice used to be a Democrat.  They’re very vulnerable to economic downturns and the abolishment of the mine safety organizations will potentially backfire. There is no love lost for billionaires and oligarchs by the mountain folks.    Antidotally, take a look at Sen Moore’s social media and 97% of the comments are very negative about her choices and performance.  They’re calling her out on her hypocrisy and policies that hurt her constituents. There will be a huge backlash if Medicare/Medicaid and other social services are cut.  That state survives on social welfare and benefits.",Competitive_Ad291,2025-05-06T12:08:41,3
"Their best bet for a state to target that isn’t Maine/North Carolina is Ohio imo.   I am biased because I’m from Ohio. But polls suggest that out of all the red states to flip, Ohio is the most vulnerable, especially if Sherrod Brown runs again. He performed 7 points better than Harris in the state.  It’s still going to be an uphill battle. It’s still improbable but not impossible.",Done327,2025-05-06T12:02:38,2
Same way liberals in Australia & Canada overcame theirs... ,StrangerFew2424,2025-05-06T12:13:42,2
"I've looked at the map it's probably impossible to regain the senate. Susan Collins in Maine and Thom Tillis in North Carolina are realistic targets. There's probably a lot of stretch targets if there is a recession e.g Dan Sullivan in Alaska, the Ohio seat in 2026, John Cornyn in Texas but I am fairly skeptical that those states are the one's most vulnerable to anti-trump backlash. I could see Texas in play if Cornyn retires and MAGA elects somewhat more viscerally antagonistic but I don't think 2026 is the year Texas flips. Steve Daines in Montana I don't think is polarizing enough to lose in a red state.   On the other hand  Osoff in Georgia could realistically lose. Without a recession or a bad Republican candidate I think this maybe even more likely than not. You also have three states (Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire) which while all probably going blue could conceivably be lost if the Republicans pick the right candidate. I would probably bet on them all going blue though.   So in total I see the most realistic option is a pickup of 1 seat with 2-3 seat pickup if the economy goes real south but that won't be enough to flip congress nor do I think a non-majority better margin matters much because the only realistic way to get there is to boot out Collins and McConnell's retiring which means that there will still be a voting majority of do whatever Trump wants in the senate.",somethingicanspell,2025-05-06T11:39:33,2
The comments are loaded with (justified) upset at Schumer and very little about the plan to retake Senate. Can anyone living in any of the states mentioned comment on the feasibility of the Dems winning?,rainshowers_5_peace,2025-05-06T11:21:57,1

"Dems need to learn to win in red-ish states again, and that means capitulating to Trump on some issues, particularly immigration and trade, but promoting their own type of economic populism. The ultimate strategy, I think, is to be firmly against illegal immigration, in favor of moderate tariffs and protectionism, attack the rich and powerful more as causes for economic grievances, and support deep new economic changes like universal healthcare and/or massive new spending on housing. They need to take the current, anti-globalism mood and shift it into a productive or even progressive direction.",Scarlettail,2025-05-06T11:37:57,-4

"Problem with Ohio is it is also a governor year next year. And the Dems don't have any house hold popular names expect for S. Brown. I really hope, but the insane turnout from rural counties in 24 and lack of turnout in cities have me concerned that Ohio has a long way to crawl out from being deep red now.",pistachiopudding,2025-05-06T12:26:42,3
"I don’t see Ossoff losing GA, especially if MTG runs against him.   I see Iowa as a possible win.  The impact of the tariffs will be huge to farmers and they’ve already turned out strongly for Bernie rallies and pissed at Republican town halls.  They had a D Senator in Harkin for 30 years before Ernst.  She seems so self-serving.  Iowans are smart and practical",Competitive_Ad291,2025-05-06T12:00:19,1
"With Kemp not running, I feel Ossoff will win. Republicans don’t really have another good candidate to field. Democrats tend to do better in lower turnout elections, especially midterms.",Done327,2025-05-06T12:05:21,1
Assuming Beshear runs to fill McConnells seat I could see that being a flip when the time comes.,Jumpy-Coffee-Cat,2025-05-06T12:11:59,1
"Betting markets have it +155 for dems to retake senate in 26.   (This means you bet $100 now for dems to take control, and they do, you win your $100 back+$155 in 2026)   Clear underdog but not like 2:1 odds yet.",Hot_Ambition_6457,2025-05-06T11:27:57,5
"I live in Texas, so any flip here would indicate an absolute shitshow for Republicans at large. But Paxton is planning to primary Senator Cornyn, and plenty of voters across the aisle think he's corrupt. Doubt that would make them vote blue though.   There are some super early polls that have me hopeful. But time and time again those hopes have been dashed. I'd think North Carolina and Maine are the easiest pickups.",fuckishouldntcare,2025-05-06T11:30:05,3
I live in Ohio. Is it possible? Yes. Is it probable? No. We’ll see. Sherrod Brown is still very popular and is more well known than Husted. But Husted is a brand of Republican that most people in Ohio like.  Which is old-school feel but still does whatever Trump wants.,Done327,2025-05-06T12:16:17,2
"Not too familiar with Americans, are you?     We are, quite frankly, some of the stupidest, most easily mislead group of voters on the planet.  Many ether don't vote at all, or worse, vote for those who promise to hurt the people they don't like.",GravtheGeek,2025-05-06T11:57:43,4
"Anytime I see immigration mentioned as some sort of failed policy by Dems I laugh. Remember, Biden and Obama outpaced Trump on deportations AND the previous Congress had reached bipartisan agreements on an immigration bill that satisfied just about all Republican talking points before the GOP torpedoed it because Trump didn’t want to lose the ability to campaign on immigration.",Jumpy-Coffee-Cat,2025-05-06T12:08:45,8

"At least Paul, Collins, Murkowski and almost McConnell have shown they have a bottom line. The bar is in hell but they still went over it recently.   Cassidy strikes me as able to do the right, he voted to convict Trump IIRC but hasn't done anything which could labeled ""the right thing"" recently.",rainshowers_5_peace,2025-05-06T11:30:27,2
"Yes but the issue is Democrats don't run on that. Most Americans are not aware, and instead of really hammering how tough they are on immigration, Dems tend to avoid the topic or don't brag as much, probably because they don't want to upset progressives or activists who don't like the deportations.",Scarlettail,2025-05-06T12:16:02,0
