"I just heard Idiot Trump yesterday say he wants all ballots cast on Election Day, no other time. All paper ballots. Proof of citizenship for every voter - a special card or something probably with his picture on it.  That's why I got a Real ID. We already have a ""special card "" for proof of citizenship, he's just ignorantly unaware until they tell him about it closer to the mid-terms. You know it's coming.",YallerDawg,2025-04-10T12:30:55,7
Make voting a national holiday and give everyone a paid day off….makes it that much easier for people to vote on Election Day. Provide free transportation to the polls for everyone.,Over_Marionberry9312,2025-04-10T17:03:22,1

"Real ID around $30-$50, more if you need out-of-state certified birth certificate. Passport over $200.  Lot like a poll tax now, isn't it?",YallerDawg,2025-04-10T12:48:40,5
