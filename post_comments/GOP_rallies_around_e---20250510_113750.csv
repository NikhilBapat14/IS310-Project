"Dude whose reaction to seeing a Black man running is to pull a shotgun in him is being defended by Republicans? No...   I can't believe people are finally accepting what was being said about him during the primaries. But they're still excusing it as being part of the stroke.   Nah. This is who he has always been. He just leaned into that anti-establishment angle because that was getting him support.   Fetterman got challenged for his mayorship and used non-public records to disclose things about his opponent. Nobody opposed him after that.   When he was mayor, he delegated some of his powers over the police to the chief of police. Real progressive to put the police in charge of themselves.   He acted like Trump and used his official speeches to go after his political opponents. So egregiously that the town council went so far as to ask to have him arrested.   He wasn't pro sex-worker, instead trying to shut down strip clubs, though that was probably more because he was trying to be the tough on crime mayor and one of 9 killings during his tenure happened there.   His only real leftwing position before running for Senate was gay marriage. Everything else was centrist ""we need to protect the jobs"" or right leaning ""this business I opened that will close in a year¬†needs a PPP loan"".   But he wasn't the establishment pick, so he must be to the left of Conor Lamb.",Motodoso,2025-05-10T12:11:44,1

"Why not both? Because not voting the way you‚Äôd like someone to vote is never a successful reason for convincing someone to resign. Do you have any recent examples of someone being forced to resign purely due to their votes? The recourse for unhappy voters is electorally, whether in the general election or a primary.

It‚Äôs been his actual health and behavior, which **is** a valid reason to ask for someone‚Äôs resignation.
