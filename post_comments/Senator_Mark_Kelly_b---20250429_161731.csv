"So cute how the average idiot thinks Hegseth's job position has anything to do with competency, leadership, knowledge, ability, skills, etc. He is there for the sole purpose of guaranteeing that military forces will be at 47's disposal when he seizes power. He is purging those showing the slightest hesitation as we speak.",NAGDABBITALL,2025-04-29T17:07:51,73
"Hegseth should be in jail for sharing war plans on Signal with family and Fox, using a personal, unsecured device. And military service man or woman would be arrested for that.",TampaWes,2025-04-29T19:12:09,23

It's hard to imagine someone more destructive than Hegseth.  Moral must be at an all-time low.,Troubled202,2025-04-29T20:42:34,6
Americans are less safe because Hegseth an asshole.  There was **never** any possible this dipshit could run anything larger than a frat party.,Motor_Educator_2706,2025-04-29T20:48:34,7

Americans are safer relying on random Walmart Greeters than they ever will be with this lunatic as Secretary of Defence.,Foreign-Yard-6632,2025-04-29T20:54:45,3
"Agree with Kelly. Would add Democrats ought to be on steps of Congress carrying out pressers calling Mike Johnson as a traitor to the men and women in our military. Anyone who doesn't want to look into Pete ""the whiskey soaked red flag"" Hegseth and his willingness to share secret information that won't be kept in the record through unsecure channels with anyone and everyone does not care about Americans. They happily spent a years talking up Hunter Biden's dong but want to brush this under the table  Its bullshit and democrats need to be out there instead of hawking books like Schumer.",rounder55,2025-04-29T22:11:37,3
There's no denying this.  The Pentagon is in chaos and they've turned against him because he's so erratic and over zealous in reshaping the military into what it's not supposed to be.,OldSchoolBubba,2025-04-29T22:24:11,3
"You mean by dropping a plane into the sea off his boat?  Yes, Oete is making us less safe and a laughingstock.  Could you imagine a real attack and how we would need to succumb?  A workd power down the drain…",SharpsterBend,2025-04-29T21:30:54,2
"Hegseth is just the idiot child in the corner that people can point and focus on while everyone else can do whatever crooked schemes they’ve conceived. (Sometimes they give him a playmate, you know him as Vance)",jenk1980,2025-04-30T00:17:06,2
"""Mismanagement"" is a poor characterization of Hesgeth's tenure because it implies there was an attempt to manage in the first place. I'd call it more of a ""flailing shitshow of incompetence"".",underpants-gnome,2025-04-30T06:25:21,2
"I will laugh my ass off if Trump forgots to pardon him, and he ends up in jail for like the next 30 years.    The stuff we know about is enough for a long jail sentence, but what about the stuff we don't know about including showing up to work / and probably buying weapons while drunk / high.  Just look at the stupid stuff Joe Biden's son was charged with.",ooo-ooo-oooyea,2025-04-30T07:40:56,2

Hegseth is so utterly unfit to hold his position which is why Trump picked him.  What a way to run an administration.,That_Perception4286,2025-04-30T13:18:06,2
The US hasn't performed a military operation that benefited the average person in their own country for about 8 decades. Only those with pre-existing dependence upon or financial relations with weapons manufacturers or energy sectors.,whatareyousomekinda,2025-04-29T16:21:33,6
"And that, my friends, is a gross understatement.",Ok-Abbreviations543,2025-04-29T21:04:26,3
"The mismanagement, in many cases, is in line with the regime’s goals and provides red meat for the faithful. The most dangerous thing about Hegseth is his loyalty, which will be on display when troops are in the streets and Trump directs him to have the military kill American citizens.",BL0w1ToutY0A55,2025-04-29T18:27:43,2

About that…   Trump seems to want him out now and he’s getting his downfall soon.  The fact that ICE officers ended up arresting active duty officers in a night club doesn’t help either,Ganvoruto,2025-04-29T20:42:24,21
He could literally step aside now and say I have a drinking problem and I'm going to rehab and in a few months he won't be in the news anymore because there will be something even bigger to write about.   That's his offramp but of course he's to self centered and stupid to take his only free exit.,Festering-Fecal,2025-04-29T19:26:20,11

"But he won't be out until Trump can find someone just as willing to do whatever they're told to do the way Hegseth will now.   There aren't that many MAGA podcasters that can double-speak as well as Hegseth. Most just say what they really think and ramble on nonsensically, sarcastically, or angrily. The truly vile, bigoted, homophobic, xenophobic, racist, misogynistic, anti-any-relgion-but-protestant-Christianity (though most MAGA megaphones about that part besides what it represents culturally (the 1950s TV version of the US), those guys aren't qualified for camera work in front of the average American watching cable TV.     They need someone who believes all that stuff but doesn't say it out loud outside circles the left and average Americans never see (Rumble, exclusive dinners and meetings with MAGA party members, Project 2025 types, etc). Someone who believes the ends justify the means, and if that means the laws get ignored then 'fine'. Someone who looks and sounds decent in front of a camera. Someone who is comfortable with a lot of public exposure immediately (that takes practice). Hegseth checks all those boxes. He's not that easy to replace.",Play-t0h,2025-04-29T21:51:20,14
