"Although my opinion will be unpopular, as a commander in the military you set the example for those under your command. You must show respect for your superiors.   Nixon was my commander in chief.

They‚Äôre saying ‚Äúan order is an order. You have to respect chain of command!‚Äù And I‚Äôm not even being sarcastic. It‚Äôs actually what they‚Äôre saying,talktotheak47,2025-04-24T11:48:06,13
Counterpoint: she did set the example.  Those men have no honor and are unworthy of their positions. Silence is acceptance.  Orders come down and you either carry them out or resign.  This was probably her resignation.,WinterNo9834,2025-04-24T12:42:57,7
"No, what she should have done was use it to instill useful values into her subordinates. You could have burned the portrait for warmth, cooked a hotdog over it, skeet shooting‚Ä¶ possibilities are endless and all more useful than having it on the wall.",Charming-Diamond4147,2025-04-24T12:44:44,2

"Right, too many people on here think that you can do and say whatever you want to  at work in the military and this is not reality.  The senior command sets the tone and leads by example.  This was just a childish act and they deserve to lose their leadership and rank.  If you think you should be able to be emotional about who the president is and what they do then you should not be in the military.  I‚Äôm all for everyone having their own beliefs and feelings but you leave that off base.",SeaSea4437,2025-04-24T13:53:19,1

"Nope. But, that was still a way more aggressive response than I'd thought. O.o",AdrenochromeDream,2025-04-24T16:58:19,2
"it means that it likely does have to do with gender. Granted: we can't conclusively prove every situation but that's just a distraction  Where it a white male in command and the pictures were turned over, the benefit of the doubt would go to ""someone else did it"" - even though chain of command says CO is responsible, likely it was a PFC with an attitude, therefore bust the PFC. Unless that white male CO had an anti-trump history  As it was a woman of color in command - the choice was made to take it out on her.",kokopelleee,2025-04-24T13:24:38,3

"First off, thank you for your service. I haven‚Äôt served.   That said, maybe you can dumb it down for me? Why assume that she received this punishment because she‚Äôs female?  ETA: My base assumption is that she‚Äôs being punished because it challenges the power dynamic of the Trump admin, not because of her gender. Is that an unreasonable assumption?",theRealRudewing,2025-04-24T16:54:34,1
"I am assuming that the CO did not flip the pictures herself. Granted, the CO is responsible for everything that happens (mostly), but she likely didn‚Äôt do it herself. If there was evidence she had, they‚Äôd be screaming that out loudly. She‚Äôs the CO, and she‚Äôs responsible, but another CO likely would not have gotten anything close to this punishment if any punishment at all.   I don‚Äôt understand what you mean by ‚Äúchallenges the power dynamic of the Trump administration.‚Äù Can you elaborate?",kokopelleee,2025-04-24T17:46:14,1
"Gotcha. My take was that this was a political move by the administration. They won‚Äôt tolerate anyone or anything that threatens their image of power.   Regardless of who had flipped it, I think this admin would‚Äôve moved to punish the CO, whether male or female.",theRealRudewing,2025-04-24T17:57:06,1
