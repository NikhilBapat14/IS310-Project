I just got an email yesterday from Ford saying they're offering employee pricing to buyers now.   People aren't buying vehicles already and they're trying to offload stock.   Good luck to them if they decide to raise prices even more.,Quirky-Marsupial-420,2025-05-07T13:55:36,158
Every company will pass on increased costs to consumers. Maybe just a meet increase of the tarrifs. Maybe they keep their same margins and it goes up even higher than the tarrifs itself. But consumers will pay the costs,JurassicParkFood,2025-05-07T21:11:30,28
They are free to do that.  We are free to not buy them.  They can just sit there on dealer lots like a bunch of rocks.,PsychologicalHat1480,2025-05-07T11:31:27,103

"Iâ€™ve never bought a Ford and wasnâ€™t planning to soon.  Iâ€™d rather pay a little more for a Toyota or Honda, both of which are largely made here anyway.  AND generally more reliable over time.   But heck, I still drive my 22+ year old Dodge truck and 25+ year old Jeep.  When one goes down for repairs, I drive the other.",Narrow-Trash-8839,2025-05-07T11:51:12,25
"> Ford is the most American company,"" CEO Jim Farley told NPR on Wednesday. ""We make 80% of what we sell in the U.S. here. And so the tariffs, for us, are a bit different than the [auto] industry.""  >We only import about 10% or something like that. And so for us, we have 6% to 10% margins, 25% tariff on the parts that we don't build in here. Like 20% of our vehicles, you know, is billions. But we can offset that, and it depends on how our competitors act.  >We announced today â€” actually, I can announce it right now â€” that we're extending employee pricing through July 4. We want to enter this period of uncertainty by reassuring Americans that if you buy a Ford, you don't have to worry about that at least through July 4. And we're just going to have to see how the competitors react after that.",dunkeater,2025-05-07T14:56:27,4

Ok jack up prices even more when people are already not buying. Don't come begging for a bailout this time because you greedy fucks can't ever get enough. That includes the other two as well.,jmartin251,2025-05-07T20:58:12,-1
"My friend lives in Louisville, KY and she says they still have unsold Ford's parked all over the city.  I keep wondering how you sell a car as new that is several years old ðŸ¤·",Berserkerbabee,2025-05-07T14:38:43,49
"Tariffs and prices are just so much more complex than the media makes them out to be. Yes, it is true that corporations will always try and push costs onto consumers. But thatâ€™s not always feasible. There is a ton more that goes into the decision making process when setting prices. And that formula is different for every product category.  Just using this current car discussion as an example, cars are a big ticket item for 99.99% of the population. 25% tariffs? You canâ€™t simply raise the prices of new cars 25% and call it a day. People will consider all of the options. Used cars, keeping their existing cars for longer, or other brands are all viable options. Used cars go up in value, but how much? Nowhere near whatever 25% of a new car is. They also have to compete with other car brands. Are other car brands able to minimize their tariff impacts such that they can maintain their prices better?   The bottom line is that Fordâ€™s primary goal is to maximize profit. And itâ€™s an incredibly complex and ever changing balancing act that they are managing to do so.",r777m,2025-05-07T16:38:15,45

"Honda and Toyota also both manufacture cars in Canada and Mexico, in addition to importing cars from overseas. Hard to get recent numbers, but one site indicated that Toyota built about half of their cars sold in the US here, about a quarter in Canada or Mexico, and about a quarter elsewhere. Ford still assembles ~79% of their cars here. Plus salaries for non-plant staff and profits stay here when you buy from a US automaker.  Margins are slim for auto manufacturing, they aren't nearly large enough that companies can just eat the tariffs. If costs go up, sale prices go up. They are going to go up for Hondas and Toyotas too. That's the whole point, if the goal is to get companies to move more manufacturing here, but companies can't build factories overnight.",Moto302,2025-05-07T13:48:01,58

"100% agreed.   Iâ€™ve got a 2012 and a 2016 vehicle. Both paid off.   Would I like a newer vehicle? Yeah of course.   But my wife and I have damn near perfect credit and an SUV would be like minimum 700 dollars on a monthly payment right now. Itâ€™s just not something weâ€™re willing to do when weâ€™ve got two other vehicles, plus my work truck, that we pay zero dollars on. Plus all our other costs. Hard to justify not just running these Japanese vehicles till like 280k miles.   11 years ago I bought a nice F150 that had 3k miles on it, I paid like 260 dollars a month on a 5 year loan.   You can barely get a beater car today for a 260 dollar payment.",Quirky-Marsupial-420,2025-05-07T16:51:00,30

"Used market is ridiculous too.  Last year I sold a 99 Dodge Dakota 4x4 that had a rust hole in one of the fenders, almost non existent clear coat and a massive exhaust leak for $3800 in like a week on FB Marketplace. It had like 150k miles on. Not terrible for how old it was, but still enough to be a concern.   It had some bad fucking ass tires on it though that allowed it to just straight up ignore snow.

"Two things REALLY bothered me about that: 1. that Ford and GM were in such bad shape despite supplying like 99% of all rental, government, and other fleet vehicles, and 2. the rules for the bailout money were so lax, and none of them really seemed aimed at encouraging the companies to fix themselves.  It was just token stuff like ""don't fly private jets so much"" and ""don't give any executives any raises for a while.""
