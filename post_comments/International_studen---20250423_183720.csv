If you got a letter you probably don't have much choice.  Either leave or end up in a detention center until they do deport you.  And hope you don't have any tattoos that give them reason to send you to El Salvador.   The USA is sooo screwed.,Brilliant-Advisor958,2025-04-23T18:48:20,17

Eff this garbage. This is a breach of contract with these students.,bluebird-1515,2025-04-23T20:32:42,1
Get out fast if you can. The US is now a 3'rd world nation with little to no legal rights and you risk getting thrown in jail without due prosses if you are darker than cafe latte or as you said got tattoos.  The US is now fast tracking to a dictatorship and it is most likely to late to stop it peacefully.,Erikblod,2025-04-24T05:23:19,3
"It’s going to take years to foment a revolution. I’m in my 50s and I believe we will still be a fascist nation when I die. Heartbreaking to see the USA come to this. Truly heartbreaking. It’s going to be a rough century for us, and our children and grandchildren. I’ll be shocked if there is a presidential election in 2028.",Perle1234,2025-04-23T20:59:24,7
