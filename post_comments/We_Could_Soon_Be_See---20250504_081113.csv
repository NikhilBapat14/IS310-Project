"It's not the availability of product it's the price of product. At the consumer level.  Above that at the industry level it's entirely different. If companies can't afford to make the product then they won't. If companies don't think customers can afford over the counter medicine or school supplies or toys then they just won't make them or ship them to USA. There's price gouging yes but at a certain level even CEOs know customers won't pay too high a price especially if their margins stay the same and the price increase is just to pay Trump and Republicans.     And it's not just tariffs either. China took a page from USA's playbook and is now doing to USA what USA has been doing to China for years. Don't forget that during the Great Supply Chain Break of 2020 countries wanted to get trade back up and running. Now, you have China and Japan that don't want to pay extortion money to Trump. Slight difference but it is there.   China Just Turned Off U.S. Supplies Of Minerals Critical For Defense & Cleantech   https://cleantechnica.com/2025/04/05/china-just-turned-off-u-s-supplies-of-minerals-critical-for-defense-cleantech/   > What China did wasn’t a ban, at least not in name. They called it export licensing. Sounds like something a trade lawyer might actually be excited about. But make no mistake: this was a surgical strike. They didn’t need to say no. They just needed to say “maybe later” to the right set of paperwork. These licenses give Beijing control over not just where these materials go, but how fast they go, in what quantity, and to which politically convenient customers. >  > The U.S.? Let’s just say Washington should get comfortable waiting behind the rope line. The licenses have to be applied for and the end use including country of final destination must be clearly spelled out. Licenses for end uses in the U.S. are unlikely to be approved. What’s astonishing is how predictable this all was. China has spent decades building its dominance over these supply chains, while the U.S. was busy outsourcing, divesting, and cheerfully ignoring every report that said, “Hey, maybe 90% dependence on a single country we keep starting trade wars with and rattling sabers at is a bad idea.” >  > Try ramping up your semiconductor fab or solar plant when your indium source just dried up. It’s a fun exercise in learning which of your suppliers used to be dependent on Beijing but never mentioned it in the quarterly call. >  > The materials China just restricted aren’t random. They’re chosen with the precision of someone who’s read U.S. product spec sheets and defense procurement orders. Start with dysprosium. If your electric motor needs to function at high temperatures—and they all do—then mostly it is using neodymium magnets doped with dysprosium. No dysprosium, no thermal stability. No thermal stability, no functioning motor in your F-35 or your Mustang Mach-E. China controls essentially the entire supply of dysprosium, and no, there is no magical mine in Wyoming or Quebec waiting in the wings. If dysprosium doesn’t come out of China, it doesn’t come out at all. It’s the spinal cord of electrification, and right now China’s holding the vertebrae. >  > So here we are. China has responded to Trump’s tariffs by cutting off U.S. supply of some of the most essential ingredients of the modern world.  Remember, people in China can buy stuff made in China. People in USA can't buy all the stuff they want made in USA. Most USA factories are dependent on a foreign country to make a finished product. Except Twinkies. I looked that up yesterday.

"The whole plan displays a complete luddite level of understanding of the whole deal.   Global supply chain just means you do stuff where it’s most efficient to do it; and then you move it to the next place where it’s most efficient (cheapest) for the next stage, and on and on.    You end up with a very complicated engine where everything is made everywhere.    The peanuts are grown in Nigeria and Argentina, but shipped and ground and bottled in the Netherlands, and then Brazil and Canada supply the sugar and the wheat, and then it’s all shipped to a factory in Chicago to make a Nutter Butter.   That chain took a decade to set up.   The sudden trade war isn’t going to drive manufacturing back to the US, that takes a decade.   It’s just running the engine without any oil, where nobody can do anything.  And the US certainly can’t start growing enough peanuts and sugar in a month to meet demand.

There are still a few things that aren't mine down here, such as kitchen essentials, so I've been pricing them on Shein/Temu/Amazon and shipping to the family home once I find something that works. That being said, I'm already able to see an increase in price in silverware, stoneware, and textiles.

"This is going to be really hard on an entire nation that’s been enjoying free trade and consumerism culture for the last 40(?) years.  My advice as a British person who likes to be prepared for the worst when it comes to potential food shortages (we did a Brexit and severed all our decent trading ties with our closest neighbours so I’ve lived what the US is about to go through trade wise).  Stock up on essentials, buy local, like farmers markets and your family run grocery store. Purchase only domestically grown seasonal fruits and vegetables— if you have a garden or enough space to do some raised planters or a few 50lr tubs? Buy some multipacks of seeds and a little seasonal sowing pocketbook guide (or download an app or use the goog machine/Alexa Marie) to read up on what needs planted when and what is easiest to grow.   While you can, if you can, buy 16kg bags of flour (all purpose/plain, strong white and self raising), buy bulk dried yeast or live yeast to keep wrapped up airtight in your fridge. I can’t recommend buying apocalypse flour as I call it enough, our individual 16kg bags last us 9 months and we do a lot of home cooking and baking. Bulk rice and pasta can’t go a miss either.",fullpurplejacket,2025-05-05T03:27:13,1
"> Don’t expect a toilet paper shortage like what we experienced during COVID lockdown. Because many essential goods like food, beverages and paper goods are more likely to be made domestically, they are more immune from these shortages, said Casey Armstrong  The toilet paper and food shortages during the start of COVID were due to a spike in demand, not a supply problem.  At any given moment, while supply is adequate, whether grocery store shelves are stocked with a particular item is down to a stag hunt. As long as most people agree that most people won’t start hoarding, we stay at the good equilibrium, and store shelves stay full. If something flips that confidence, we switch to the bad equilibrium, and shelves empty.  This is not down to individuals being irrational, either. If you believe essential goods will become unavailable, the _rational_ move is to stock up. The irrationality is at the level of the entire system.  So the question is: when people see _some_ empty shelves due to supply issues, will they expect panic buying to empty the other shelves? And I wouldn’t bet against that.",gurenkagurenda,2025-05-05T04:06:18,1

"During the early days of COVID when people were panic buying, the scale of that panic buying kind of spooked me and I stocked up a little bit. When I say a little bit, I mean a very little bit. I bought maybe 10 cans of beans and vegetables and a couple gallons of water. I was a little nervous, but confident enough even in the first Trump administration that the rest of the State and Federal government would have their shit together and I only needed to be prepared for a small disruption. Within 6 months of buying those things, the uneaten cans of green beans became like a funny little visual reminder of the panic of those initial few weeks. Every time I'd open the pantry and see them, I'd kind of roll my eyes or smirk.  Now?  I've got half a dozen gallons of water, a 10 pound bag of rice, a few dozen cans of beans, vegetables and fruits, a bunch of dried fruit-- not exactly Doomsday Prepper level but far more canned and dried food and water than I'd ever ordinarily have on hand just for myself. I picked up like a 25 pound bag of dried cat food and overstocked on my cat's canned food too. Again, nothing that would last me through some kind of zombie apocalypse but for sure scaled up considerably from what I had on hand during the early panic days of COVID. This disaster is much worse. Need to have stuff on hand in case it literally disappears from store shelves entirely or becomes prohibitively expensive due to hyperinflation, need to have stuff on hand in case of widespread layoffs or to feed myself during a General Strike. With the CDC and every other agency meant to look out for health and safety in the USA completely gutted, all of the existing threat COVID presented exists now in a hyper-dangerous form. Who knows what's out there, who's getting sick and how it's spreading? We're not looking at that anymore. We're not keeping poison out of food.  I hope that someday soon I find myself donating a lot of these cans of beans, vegetables and fruits to my local food pantry. I hope that in the not-too-distant future, I'll look at whatever is left over in my pantry and kind of roll my eyes or smirk at myself for being so worried over nothing.  I have a bad feeling though, that I haven't prepared nearly enough for what's about to happen in the next few years.",ill_monstro_g,2025-05-04T16:30:40,478

"You don’t need to spend money on a bidet.

Plus, it’s a whole hell of a lot less messy.  The one thing they don’t tell you about the bidet is that yeah you’re gonna spray water up your butt, but then how do you dry it?  Grab some toilet paper?  Then you’ve got tiny bits of toilet paper that are stuck to the bottom of your ass.  Grab a towel?  Now you got a smelly towel with residual poop on it that you keep sitting next to your toilet.  Just do a good scrubbing with soap and water in your shower every time you take a poop and then wipe yourself normally with a towel knowing that you’re not going to get any poop on the towel because you did a really good job, scrubbing your butt in the shower with soap and water.",jb4647,2025-05-04T11:35:23,-1

The human is basically saying ""what a good boy for being scared, keep up the good work being scared.""  Also, the dog will look directly at your face for direction, and if you give them the ""oh poor pup"" expression, they'll read it and believe it.  Best thing to do is is tell him to ""go get it"". Cheer for him. Or just ignore the fireworks  This is the same thing that children do. They fall off the bike and immediately look to the parent on how to react. If the parent panics, so does the kid.

It is a lot more complicated. US executives outsourced their manufacturing to China. The shareholders therefore had higher earnings and the stocks went up so they were happy. The executives who pushed to outsource were compensated very well as their share value went up too. 401k holders also benefited from the rising stock price, and the consumers were able to buy more with less money. Everyone on both sides of the trade wins. This model is only sustainable if we could export an equal amount to other countries.  And that is the pickle we are in today: we didn’t invest enough in our technology and services. The republicans fought against the US being on the cutting edge of alternate energy sources (due to Oil company lobbyists), so we lost our lead.

What the person is saying is that the cuts to education, over reliance and emphasis on capital gains and speculation or the money markets is causing the US to no longer be competitive where others considered buying American. The US doesn't lead in any categories except for arms exports - think about that for a second.

"You do not need a plumber, but it is helpful to know a little bit about how the valves work.  Your toilet will typically be connected to the wall through a valve that you can close manually. This valve has probably been sitting there open for years, if not decades. The rubber gaskets and o-rings within it are undoubtedly now inflexible, and will not give a good seal. So when you close the valve and then drain the toilet tank according to the installation instructions, things should be fine while you attach a bypass onto the water supply hose. Be careful when you are turning the hose connectors so that you don't accidentally cross thread them. That is to say, make sure that the threads match properly and are engaging smoothly.   One thing to understand about these types of connectors is that The threaded collars that you are turning are not used to seal the connection. They are simply there to apply pressure to the gasket which is pushing against the end of the hoses. That gasket is what seals against water pressure.   After everything is connected, if you are using a cheap bidet that uses your house water pressure only, be sure that the controls are set to the off position so you will not get it an accidental spray of water when you restore water pressure. Now you can open the valve connecting your toilet and bidet to the water pipe in the wall.  If you wish, you can now test out the bidet to see that is working.  And now here is the problem: The gasket on the valve to the wall may have become too stiff to properly seal anymore. And so that valve will begin to leak a little bit. If you are lucky, it will only be a drip of water, but it must be remedied. The valve stem is generally projecting out of a cap that is threaded into the valve. This cap is called a ""packing nut"". The gasket that prevents water from leaking out is sometimes called a ""stem packing"", and is placed directly underneath that threaded cap. It is snug against the valve stem and so prevents water from coming out. This is the point of failure if you are getting this kind of leak. It is easily remedied without having to buy new replacement parts .  Photo number 4 of this page gives a good illustration of this kind of valve   https://www.peterhemp.com/blog/string-me-alongplease  The remedy is to tighten the packing nut using a pair of pliers or a wrench. You don't need to tighten it a lot. Just enough to stop the leak. If you tighten it too much, there is a risk that you can crack the body of the valve itself, so don't go overboard. What happens is that the packing nut will compress the stem packing, making it tighten up around the valve stem.   Once this is done, dry everything off with a towel. Maybe put a bowl underneath the valve, and then check it after a couple of hours to make sure that it is not simply leaking very slowly now. If it continues to leak, tighten the packing nut a little more. This is generally more than sufficient.   I know that my description and instructions here are long and detailed. I tend to write like this, and it makes a simple task look overly complex. Please excuse me for this, but I like to cover every contingency. It is really a simple task, once you are familiar with the different components that you are working with.",Unique-Coffee5087,2025-05-04T11:45:18,12

"Water alone can clean some things just fine, but I think you're misunderstanding that after you use the bidet you wipe your ass still (did you think everyone using a bidet just puts their wet ass back in their clothes?) the combination of spraying down with water and wiping is quite effective for cleaning in this context. Also fairly certain you're conflating ""cleaning"" with ""sanitizing"". Cleaning is just the removal of dirt and debris from something, and using a bidet does a better job of cleaning crap off of you than just wiping. Sanitizing is reducing microbes on something and I doubt very many people are wiping their ass with 70% isopropanol wipes after having cleaned the shit off first.",CarthasMonopoly,2025-05-04T12:16:54,4
