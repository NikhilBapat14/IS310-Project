">The administration alleged that in the original encounter, the judge ordered immigration officials to leave the courthouse, saying they did not have a warrant signed by a judge to apprehend the suspect they were seeking, who was in court for other reasons.

First they came for the aliens. Then they came for the minorities that didn’t look like them. Then they went after law firms that stood up. Then they started eroding rights. When the courts intervened they came for the judges.   Welcome to fascism.,baquir,2025-04-25T11:32:00,14

"No. People are intentionally lying about what happened.  The ICE agents showed up and were directed to Dugan's courtroom. They were asked if they had a warrant, they said yes and produced it. Dugan directed them to the office of the chief judge saying that office had to review/copy the warrant. The ICE agents complied. While they were at the chief judge's office Dugan led the wanted person through a staff-only door to bypass the public areas where he would have been spotted by the ICE agents. Dugan personally and actively aided the escape, which is a crime.",TheQuarantinian,2025-04-25T12:12:55,-15
">Kash Patel, the Trump-appointed FBI director, wrote mid-morning on X: “We believe Judge Dugan intentionally misdirected federal agents away from the subject to be arrested in her courthouse, Eduardo Flores Ruiz, allowing the subject – an illegal alien – to evade arrest.”  Maybe she is innocent.

They got a warrant to arrest the judge...,TheQuarantinian,2025-04-25T12:06:54,3
"It was an administrative warrant. That's a warrant from DHS that they create themselves. The judge asked if it was a judicial warrant (aka, ""a warrant signed by a judge"" as referenced above). There are limits to what this ""warrant"" gets them...  For example, an administrative warrant does not authorize them to enter private property... (like your home, or a non public area of a business like a kitchen). You also don't have to actively help them if they show up with only an adminsitrative warrant asking if an employee is working that day, for example.   It is not the same as an arrest warrant signed by a judge that has an actual standard of proof behind it. This is basically just a name on a spreadhseet coming up then being printed on company letterhead.  That said, whether letting someone use a jurors exit will count as actively undermining ""law enforcement"" (even though its a civil agency with a civil enforcement mandate) when they are operating in a public area will be the question... it's not about the piece of paper.",MaxerSaucer,2025-04-25T13:26:00,6
"Let’s see what the court says. I think we can all agree that the Trump administration will need to have this 100% nailed down though, because if it transpires that they’ve got this wrong and that they’re arresting judges, it would be a very, very dark turn indeed.",PiedPiperofPiper,2025-04-25T12:21:34,7

"I can certainly appreciate the technical differences. Boo on the media for not being 100% accurate.  However, that there was ""a"" warrant does not appear to be in dispute. The chief judge's office seems to have recognized the warrant as valid and did not dispute it. They were not seeking to enter private property.  Dugan, on the other hand, reported stated simply ""a warrant was not presented in the hallway on the 6th floor."" She didn't say that a ""valid"" warrant wasn't presented, she didn't say that a ""warrant signed by a judge"" wasn't presented, she seems to have claimed that there was no warrant of any kind.  You are right - it isn't about the paper, it is about whether or not her actions constitute obstruction of justice. It certainly appears though that a sworn office assisted somebody in evading arrest.",TheQuarantinian,2025-04-25T13:38:23,-1
"They will absolutely have to have it 100% nailed down.  And even though the truth here is unpopular, the judge *did* personally escort a person actively sought by law enforcement agents through a restricted area with the explicit intention of helping them avoid a warrant the judge knew to be valid. If another judge did that to help somebody avoid her warrant she would be apoplectic.  Not only was this a crime, she should be disbarred over this.",TheQuarantinian,2025-04-25T12:28:31,-11
"They cite ""an email to judges"" from the chief judge, and so far nobody seems to be contesting that bit.  All this fuss because she wanted to protect a violent man: the accused was playing music too loudly and when asked to turn it down beat a guy - punched him 30 times. Then when a woman tried to pull him off he started punching her, too.",TheQuarantinian,2025-04-25T12:56:10,-2
