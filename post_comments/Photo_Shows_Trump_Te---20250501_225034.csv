*From Bloomberg News Reporters Nick Wadhams and Jamie Tarabay:*  President Donald Trump recently suggested he’d rather his administration didn’t use the Signal messaging app. A recent photo suggests his team isn’t getting the message.  A photograph taken by Reuters shows National Security Adviser Mike Waltz — who was later [removed](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-01/national-security-advisor-mike-waltz-to-step-down-cbs-says-ma5hgypw) from the job and nominated as US ambassador to the UN — checking chats on what appeared to be a modified version of Signal at a meeting attended by Trump and his Cabinet on Wednesday.

"This isn't at all surprising. I think what many people failed to understand that we originally only found out about the signal use because of the leak. Essentially if people are doing something and get found out, rarely is it ever the first time.   Which ultimately means even though we haven't had more leaks revealed, they are of course still using it across the board.",KazeNilrem,2025-05-01T23:03:17,3

They’re in Signal right now. Going over how they’re going make everyone’s lives worse again tomorrow. They’re lolling and lmaoing and roflcoptering about your anxiety over money and your job and your shrinking retirement and your healthcare and you thinking some 200 year old piece of paper is going to stop them from fucking your shit up  for fun repeatedly.,BL0w1ToutY0A55,2025-05-02T01:02:40,3
