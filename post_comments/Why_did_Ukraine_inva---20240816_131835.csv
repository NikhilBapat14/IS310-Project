"The potential downsides are more substantial:  * there is a probability Putin use nukes. He'll use the small bomb on his territory to stop the Ukrainian advance. This would be justified and terrorizing;  No he won't and also it needs to be more than just him wanting to use nukes. He has said multiple times he would use nukes if the west does XYZ and the west does XYZ and nothing happens. There is also the fact China and India said they will not support Russia if they use nukes and that will cut off most of the supplies that Russia is getting. The last point is if he uses nukes the west will go hard core F you on him.  * while atacking in Kursk Ukraine will lose Pokrovsk and eventually whole Donbas;  My crystal ball isn't telling me what will happen, but also remember Ukraine is getting a lot of new troops so yes Ukraine will lose some land but they would lose some land if they didn't do this. Russia is also having to pull troops from these areas so more of the fighting will be on Russian soil and not just on Ukrainian soil.  * the western opositon against helping Ukraine gains a sound argument since Ukraine acts in Kursk as agressor;  All western countries are fully supporting this, I haven't heard of any say that this is bad.  * there is a risk that Ukrainian troops will engage in masacre of russian civilians. This is not difficul to initiae or even stage.  No there isn't and there are tons of stories already of how well the Ukrainian soldiers are treating Russian civilians and soldiers. They know this is another win for Ukraine as more and more soldiers will hear about this and surrender and also these conscripts can call home and tell them people what is really happening. This is making Putin's position much more fragile.  For me the whole decission looks more like a risky gambling then rational plan. So why did Ukraine invade Russia? Am I beeing myopic on this one?  Yes it is a big gamble but this is war and Russia wants to destroy Ukrainian people and culture.",mawkishdave,2024-08-16T14:14:28,10
"“I swear I’m not a Russian bro”   Really though, it’s for leverage and Putin is pulling his troops out of other regions to defend Kursk. Overall it’s been a tactical win for Ukraine and Russia is getting served.   On the international stage Russia looks like a joke.   Also Putin isn’t going to nuke his own land or set the precedent that tactical nukes can be used in war because he knows tactical nukes will be used by the US in engagements in the Middle East concerning Russian interest.",[deleted],2024-08-16T14:02:20,6
"Ukraine is running out of time, weapons, and manpower.  It’s unlikely the US will give Ukraine more money or weapons in the future.  Ukraine needs to maximize its leverage now to negotiate the best possible ceasefire.  So Ukraine took a big gamble.  Too early to know if it’s going to pay off or not, but Ukraine has few options.",hgqaikop,2024-08-16T22:35:52,2
"It may very well be for negotiating leverage in a soon-to-come ceasefire agreement. There may be negotiations going on that would be kept secret from the public so as not to affect morale. And any potential ceasefire would involve drawing some sort of demarcation line, so a quick land grab is going to be a win as it will allow Ukraine to trade this territory for some other territory.  Another possibility is that Ukraine is targeting a specific strategic location, such as Khalino air base in Kursk; possibly they are just trying to get into artillery range for the base.",antonulrich,2024-08-16T14:46:12,1
"So a lot will depend on how events develop and what Ukraine is actually planning on doing with the Kursk Offensive.  To me there are a few realistic options.  1. Ukraine may be trying to ""flip the narrative"" that they are slowly losing the war by showing they are capable of major offensives still. This could solidify international support at a time where it was flagging. It would also improve Ukrainian morale and reduce Russian morale.  2. Ukraine could be trying to force Russia to spread its forces. With how weak the border defenses were, it seems plausible that Russia had been concentrating all effort in the Donbass, to the detriment of border defenses. This could help relieve pressure on the Donbass by provoking Russia into counterattacking in Kursk.  3. This could basically be a peace negotiation tactic, trying to gain land to trade away for a better deal.   These are risky gambits, but that's war for you.   The big question is what will Ukraine do next?   Will they keep pushing further into Russia? That would provide the biggest incentive for Russia to counter attack to stem the tide. But it's also the most risky option. Russia has lots of land to give up if it needs to. Putin could realistically just stay the course, not take the bait, and keep hammering the Donbass. Plus, as you keep advancing, your supply lines get longer and your troops get more exposed   Will Ukraine instead set up defenses in the most advantageous areas of Kursk and basically just look to hold on for dear life? This makes a lot of military sense....but this could be countered by Putin not taking the bait and instead just looking to reestablish defenses without concentrating a massive ""liberation"" assault.  Will Ukraine basically treat this like a giant raiding party? Basically taking the territory, destroying important equipment, then hopping back over the border into Ukraine again. This is the least risky militarily and still leaves them with some big symbolic victories, but also represents the least militarily impactful outcome for Ukraine. Still, it would show Russia that it's borders aren't safe and need major reinforcement.   TLDR: basically Ukraine scored a big win here and now it's up to them how they want to play with their winnings. Will they double down, let it ride, or cash out while they are ahead?",thewalkingfred,2024-08-16T14:49:10,1
Ukraine is the aggressor now? In the war they didn't start? The one where their country was invaded unlawfully for zero reason but greed? Huh.... ok.,matthewamerica,2024-08-16T18:11:38,1
It’s a gambit to end the war. We will give you back your land if you give us back ours.,TarheelFr06,2024-08-18T21:38:04,1
"Well. Primarily Putin wants to bring back the USSR.... But what triggered it was Zielinski trying to join NATO... Both him, Biden and our allies called Putin out on his bluff and ultimately he actually did it.",ole_black_eyes19,2024-08-18T22:49:11,1
"> No there isn't and there are tons of stories already of how well the Ukrainian soldiers are treating Russian civilians and soldiers.  Disagree here. Ukrainian soldiers committing massacres, or otherwise abusing Russian civilians is definitely a risk. Ukrainian soldiers are just humans at the end of the day. No matter how committed senior AFU commanders might be to treating Russian civilians humanely, they now have thousands of Ukrainian soldiers interacting with thousands of (occupied) Russian civilians, and that creates risk for massacres/abuses to happen. ",Scaryclouds,2024-08-17T03:46:51,3
 Ukraine is getting a lot of new troops     From where are they getting new troops ?,whoareyousabnduh,2024-08-28T00:25:16,1

"I never seen any stories about this, do you have any links?",mawkishdave,2024-08-22T11:12:16,1
NP it's complicated and there is a lot of mis-information on both sides. Ukraine has to role the dice and this is how they did it. So far it looks like it was a good role but only time will tell.,mawkishdave,2024-08-16T14:30:16,3
"We have been sending billions, weapons, intelligence, and supplies since this thing kicked off. This isn't just a war between Russia and Ukraine. This is a proxy war between Russia and all of NATO.",DahRage2132,2024-08-24T08:42:52,1
"I was talking about a hypothetical.   Though there are some actual examples like Ukrainian soldiers likely looting stores: https://youtu.be/EHunjKaZ_64?si=w-utnpH7-wNd2TCK  Obviously looting of stores, as compared to the abuses Russians have carried out against Ukraine/Ukrainians is small potatoes. So not trying to make a false equivalency. Rather, I’m saying that as you have thousands of Ukrainian soldiers interacting with thousands of Russian civilians you increase the risk for abuses to occur/the perception of abuses to occur. Because, as mentioned, end of the day the Ukrainian soldiers are human. ",Scaryclouds,2024-08-22T11:33:42,1
What possible downsides do you see then?,nowheretorun22,2024-08-16T15:34:16,2
Thanks but yea that is crazy minor as you can't even prove they are looting.,mawkishdave,2024-08-22T13:38:03,1
"If this motivated the public and Putin can safely do a full mobilization. The issue with that is Russia already has a massive worker shortage.  If Russia somehow just told over the Ukrainian forces then Ukraine will lose some of their best units.  I don't see public opinion turning on Ukraine as Russia did a UN meeting crying about this and most the western countries just laughed at them.  This is making Putin seem very weak and the UK just said Ukraine can use their equipment in Russia, Biden is working on modifications to use long range cruise missile on the F-16s Ukraine has and these will be used on Russia soil. There are a million things that can go wrong and but Ukraine has shown how adaptive they are.",mawkishdave,2024-08-16T17:53:03,2
"Well   1. This is only what has been published so far to the internet. It’s likely the vast majority of abuses wouldn’t be filmed and posted online. Not to say that a lot of other abuses exist (or *perception of abuse*), just generally they won’t be recorded and posted online.  2. I can’t “prove” they are looting, but if nothing else the videos are hard to interpret as anything other than they are looting those stores. Certainly they are being disrespectful towards the civilian stores and acting unprofessionally as Ryan points out.   Again, the point isn’t to criticize Ukraine or Ukrainian soldiers. It’s that invading Russia creates a new risk category for bad PR that didn’t exist when Ukraine was liberating their own territory/people. ",Scaryclouds,2024-08-22T15:46:37,1
