At least Biden tried to do something to help the poor people of Gaza. smh,JFJinCO,2025-05-08T10:18:21,1
I dont know whats most tragic. That delivering tons of bombs is more safe than a noble cause or that the Biden administration felt it had to hide doing something good.,Melonslice09,2025-05-08T07:38:36,0
Not great. But what can you really do. Anything involving that conflict is a massive clusterfuck. Almost wish we could disengage from it entirely but that’s not going to happen.,StormOk7544,2025-05-08T07:32:50,-1
">Former president Joe Biden’s floating pier to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza was far more dangerous and costly than the public knew, leaving over 60 troops injured and costing about $230 million, according to a newly released watchdog report.

"We likely made that money back from the weapons we sold the Israelis, who used them to block the aid this pier was meant to get into Gaza.",BigDaddyBain,2025-05-08T07:39:53,-2
Biden did do nothing. This pier was just to provide cover to Israel so we could pretend there is some logistical reason the aid couldn't be delivered. Instead of this Biden could have just picked up the phone and said if Israel doesn't let the aid trucks in the US will cut off all military aid. That would have solved it without this clusterfuck of a pretend pier.,toaster_toaster,2025-05-08T07:38:59,-4

He could have picked up the phone and said let the aid trucks in or the US will cut off all military aid to Israel. Instead he tried to build a pier so he could pretend there was something other than the government of Israel preventing the aid from getting in.,toaster_toaster,2025-05-08T07:37:16,1

People can downvote but anyone who thinks Biden actually wanted to do anything other than enable Israel's genocide of the Palestinians is just as deluded about Biden as Trump supporters are about Trump.,toaster_toaster,2025-05-08T10:12:26,1
Would you say it’s better now without the “pretend pier”? Trump’s re-election is often attributed to supporters of Palestinians.,ranchoparksteve,2025-05-08T07:54:19,2
Actually Biden did worse than nothing. He actively enabled this genocide.,toaster_toaster,2025-05-08T07:39:52,-2
"I’m not sure exactly to what extent they’re reliant on our aid, but I’m pretty sure the conflict wouldn’t just grind to a halt even if we stopped most weapons shipments. He also has limited options in terms of doing that without Congress’s approval. And he probably would have gotten destroyed by voters for taking a more hardline stance against Israel which would’ve been another gift to Trump and Republicans. The whole thing is just fucked no matter how you slice it.",StormOk7544,2025-05-08T07:53:41,0

The pier never did any good. Telling the Israeli government they had to start letting the aid through would have actually done some good. Biden didn't do that because he supports the genocide of Palestinians. He is so committed to helping Israel wipe out the Palestinians that he was willing to tank the Dems chances of winning.,toaster_toaster,2025-05-08T10:10:09,3
">Trump’s re-election is often attributed to supporters of Palestinians.  By people deliberately pushing misinformation, sure. None of the data suggests that the pro-Palestinian protest votes had any meaningful impact in the end result. It's a lie Democrats tell themselves to avoid having to do proper introspection on the faults of the party that led to the loss.",Morgn_Ladimore,2025-05-08T10:22:17,3

Enjoy Trump.,addled_and_old,2025-05-08T07:47:37,7
You are wrong. Biden could have ended this with a phone call. Reagan did it. Israel is 100% dependent on our military aid.   Biden didn't stop this because he didn't want to. He supports the genocide of Palestinians.,toaster_toaster,2025-05-08T10:08:05,2
"I’d have to do more looking into what Reagan did to figure out how analogous it is to this conflict. I was skimming some stuff online and he did a couple of UN votes and some temporary holding of aid that was predictably pretty flaccid and didn’t have a ton of impact. The big incident with the phone call was about a conflict in Beirut I guess, but I’m not sure if Reagan single handedly stopped that like some people are suggesting or if he only played a minor role. The Beirut conflict also may not have been at the same scale and intensity as the conflict in Gaza too for all I know. Israel really doesn’t seem like it wants to back down at all now after the 10/7 massacre and now that they’ve got a far right government that seems like it wants to take land in Gaza or god knows what else. This shit is complex and both sides are dug in, I doubt a phone call is going to solve it.",StormOk7544,2025-05-08T10:23:14,0
