"Trump supporters thrive on outrage and victimhood. Their whole platform and ideology is centered around their culture wars and their petty grievances. Their politics and religion are inseparable and form the basis of their identities.   > ...conservative pundits and Trump loyalists fumed over the “WOKE MARXIST POPE” and complained that he is “worse than Francis,” referencing the previous pontiff known for his progressive values.  > “Sorry, Catholics. This new Pope is an open borders globalist. He will be pushing for abortion soon. This isn’t a guess. You can scroll his X account and see what he’s been up to,” alt-right conspiracy theorist Mike Cernovich griped on X.  > Newsmax anchor Rob Schmitt grumbled that this “Pope better not be woke.”   > Steve Bannon warned about Prevost’s views, claiming that he would be a poor choice for the MAGA movement.   > “I do think one of the dark horses — and unfortunately one of the most progressive — is Cardinal Prevost... he's certainly on the shortlist,”   See how MAGA thinks the world revolves around them and that it's necessary for the Pope to support *their* worldview, to align his own interests with *theirs*? That it's somehow the Pope's duty to ingratiate himself with Trump and his followers?  The Pope is a *global* leader, but these MAGA fanatics are under the impression that—especially as an American—he's obligated to strictly serve them and their beliefs.   And within mere hours of the official announcement, Trump supporters were already resorting to politicizing the situation—as they typically do—spamming social media with politically charged, clickbait posts that contained some of their favorite buzzwords and epithets.   Yes, it didn't take long for Trump supporters to use the opportunity to broadcast their outrage and bitterness to the world, all while insisting that this situation is just another example of *them* being persecuted by their ever-nebulous, woke, globalist overlords.  And what really illustrates the hypocrisy of the religious right, is how they responded to this former Tweet from Provest:   > “JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn’t ask us to rank our love for others,” Prevost tweeted earlier this year, referencing comments the vice president made about Christians needing to “prioritize” their love.   Apparently, following the teachings of Jesus Christ is ""woke."" Messages of unconditional love are ""woke.""   Oof, just wait until conservatives learn what the Bible has to say about treating foreigners...  This is a glaring example of how terms like ""woke"" and ""Marxist"" have become blanket, superficial catchwords that conservatives use to communicate things like, ""I vehemently disagree with you because you don't share the same views towards certain vulnerable groups as I do,"" or because ""you don't subscribe to the same dogma as me,"" ""you don't identity with the same things I do,"" ""you don't believe in a social order that preserves a white, Christian hegemony,"" ""you don't prioritize certain groups over others.""  And oh no! The Pope was critical of JD Vance and Trump! Must mean he's a globalist, deep state puppet whose sole objective is to tyrannize the MAGA population.  > ...social media personality Joey Mannarino groused that “the new Pope has recently attacked JD Vance, shown solidarity with Kilmar Abrego-Garcia and begged Trump to open the borders like Biden had them,” adding that “this guy is worse than Francis.”  > In a separate tweet, he went even further, calling him a “liberal piece of s***” and insisting that “we’re f***ed.” Mannarino’s spouse Ada Lluch, who credits Trump for the couple getting married (they’ve since separated), complained that the “new pope suffers from the woke mind virus.”  > “In case you're wondering why they picked an American to be a Pope for the first time in history,” MAGA influencer Vince Langman, sharing a 2015 tweet of Prevost criticizing Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric, whined. “He's a WOKE Never Trumper liberal. That's why!”  See here again, they are defined by who is victimizing them, it forms the foundation of their identity. They cannot separate their politics from their persona.  > [Laura] Loomer lamented about the “WOKE MARXIST POPE” and claimed he “is anti-Trump, anti-MAGA, pro-open Borders, and a total Marxist like Pope Francis,” adding that it’s “GROSS” that he is now in charge of the Vatican.  > “The new Pope once retweeted a post about how we need to keep praying for career criminal & drug addict George Floyd,” she raged. “The tweet said, ‘May all hatred, violence and prejudice be eradicated.’ What prejudice? Is that another way to spell FENTANYL OVERDOSE? MARXIST POPE!”  Another said:  > ""They chose a globalist and woke Pope from the West ON PURPOSE” to criticize the president...  Even the Pizzagate conspiracy theorist himself—Jack Posobiec—chimed in, appearing ""visibly irate"" in response to Provest's tweets:   > “We need to see from the jump, from the absolute jump, whether or not Pope Leo is interested in working with President Trump or — as we can see from his Twitter feed — working against him,” he said during the broadcast of his Real America’s Voice show.""  Ahh yes, it's not just the obligation, but the purpose of the new Pope to carry out the wishes of Trump and his followers.  It's as if they feel entitled to it, and therefore entitled to make demands, demands of the Pope, demands of anyone...  It's just more of the same. More catchwords and pejoratives, more of the same MAGA idiolect, more whining, more grievances, more outrage.  They believe that they are fighting in an endless war between them vs the other; the enemy; all the evils of the world.   There's always a conspiracy theory or plot—conjured up by some vague, enigmatic threat—to undermine them and their beliefs, their cause, their culture, their political leaders. They must always be at the center of some grand machination, some oppressive scheme concocted by this shadowy and nefarious authority that routinely has it out for them.

"Moreover, he didn’t even say this.  Here is a transcript:  Transcript of the initial words of Leo XIV, translated from its original Italian:  Peace be with all of you!  Dearest brothers and sisters, this is the first greeting of the Risen Christ, the good shepherd who gave his life for God's flock.  I, too, would like this greeting of peace to enter your hearts, to reach your families, and all people, wherever they are, all of the people, all over the earth.  Peace be with you!  This is the peace of the Risen Christ, an unarmed peace and a disarming peace, humble and persevering. It comes from God, God who loves us all unconditionally. We still have in our ears that weak, but always courageous voice of Pope Francis as he blessed Rome!  The Pope who blessed Rome, gave his blessing to the world, to the entire world, that Easter morning. Allow me to follow up on that same blessing: God loves us, God loves you all, and evil will not prevail!  We are all in the hands of God.  Therefore, without fear, united hand in hand with God and among ourselves, we move forward. We are disciples of Christ.   Christ precedes us. The world needs his light. Humanity needs him as the bridge to allows it to be reached by God and by his love.  Help us, too, and help each other to build bridges, with dialogue, with meetings, uniting us all to be one people, always in peace. Thank you, Pope Francis! I also want to thank all my brother cardinals who have chosen me to be Peter's Successor, and to walk together with you, as a united Church always seeking peace, justice, always seeking peace, justice, always seeking to work as men and women who are faithful to Jesus Christ, without fear, to proclaim the Gospel, to be missionaries.  I am a son of Saint Augustine, an Augustinian, who said: ""with you I am a Christian and for you I am a bishop"". In this sense, we can all walk together towards that homeland that God has prepared for us.  To the Church of Rome, a special greeting! We must seek together how to be a missionary Church, a Church that builds bridges, dialogue, always open to receive like this square with its open arms, all, all who need our charity, our presence, dialogue and love.  And if you allow me a word, a greeting to all and especially to my beloved diocese of Chiclayo, in Peru, where a faithful people accompanied their bishop, shared their faith and gave so, so much to continue being a Church that is faithful to Jesus Christ.  To all of you, brothers and sisters of Rome, of Italy, of the whole world, we want to be a Church of the Synod, a Church that walks, a Church that always seeks peace, that always seeks charity, that always seeks to be close, especially to those who suffer.  Today is the day of the Supplication to Our Lady of Pompeii. Our Mother Mary always wants to walk with us, to be close, to help us with her intercession and her love. So, I would like to pray together with you. Let us pray together for this new mission, for the whole Church, for peace in the world and let us also ask Mary, our Mother, for this special grace.

It was to defend the city from being raided (things like that used to happen).They are not necessary anymore, but they represent history, look cool, and removing them fails a cost/benefit analysis.   There’s also aqueducts and, get this, BRIDGES still standing that have been there since the Roman era.   They don’t tear those down either.   The Catholic Church is a global organization. It transcends national borders, social classes, races, colors, etc. It is also, as the Pope said, a missionary church. Seeking to grow and spread the good news.   It follows, obviously, that this Pope, and the previous Pope, desire to build bridges to connect those nations, to connect humanity, and to conduct outreach to as many people as it possibly can.   Therefore: you now understand why Vatican City (and all old cities) protected themselves with walls. And why the Catholic Church has a strong desire to build metaphorical bridges across nations and to reach unreached communities.   You’re welcome.",-Gramsci-,2025-05-08T18:44:51,26

"He definitely has in the past, but I do hope he clarifies his current position soon and that it has evolved from what it was.

It's pathetic that 2012 wasn't that long ago, but the world and the church has definitely changed a lot since then, and Pope Francis appointed the new Pope as cardinal in 2023, so mentally, I'm kind of keeping him on probation in my head until he clarifies where he stands.

"Leviticus also bans wearing clothing made from mixed materials, eating pork and shellfish, and dozens of other things Christians have never followed. That said, there can't seriously be any question on how Jesus would want people to treat refugees.  I think liberal theologians are right that the anti-gay thing isn't really that well-supported in scripture. Paul wrote that men who sleep with men should not inherit the kingdom of god, but in the same sentence he also includes for instance adulterers and drunkards, who haven't been subject to the same kind of persecution at all.   Paul was also from a Jewish background where homosexuality was banned (per Leviticus) and writing to Greeks, who were okay with it. Also, Paul had major hangups on sex in general and didn't think _anyone_ should be doing it, if they could help it. Yet the Catholic church ignores Paul where he's more liberal than they are (e.g. explicitly permitting marriages between Christians and 'heathens').  Really, Christian anti-homosexuality has always been about cultural opposition to homosexuality using scripture as a justification. You can't justify it from Leviticus when you don't follow large parts of Leviticus, can't justify it from the epistles of Paul when you don't follow much of that either. And you really can't condemn love between people given everything Jesus said.",mtaw,2025-05-09T06:38:46,1
