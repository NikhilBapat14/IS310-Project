"If a Democrat ever tries to restore *one* thing a Republican dismantled, it'll just be ""COMMUNISM! SOCIALISM!"" until none of us have anything at all.",mykonoscactus,2025-05-02T04:21:23,10

"This makes sens after reading titles of their articles on NPR website:  * President Trump's first 100 days marked by DOGE, tariffs and deportation * NPR poll: Many voters give Trump a failing grade * More give Trump an F than any other grade for first 100 days, poll finds * 4 takeaways from the week: In a world that craves stability, Trump brings the chaos * Only 39% approve of Trump's handling of economy, according to poll of first 100 days",caem123,2025-05-02T04:41:05,-2

"And you can bet fossils like Chuck Schumer will put a stop to any of those efforts so as not to ""sow division"" in-between promoting his book.",TheRustFactory,2025-05-02T04:36:11,5
"Basically crowd funding. Donate as much as you reasonably can to independent media.  Be it NPR/PBS or smaller community media channels (yeah, some still exist). That’s how many stay around. Small donations from lots of people.",Hippopotasaurus-Rex,2025-05-02T05:20:34,6
"You can donate to them. I was watching pbs the other day and they already have commercials running saying they expect funding to be cut and please consider donating.  If you still have prime, cancel and donate what a prime membership is worth.",Designer-Contract852,2025-05-02T05:29:26,5

"From what I can tell based on CBP's website and [USAspending.gov](http://USAspending.gov), CBP is about 0.005% of the total budget.  So, by eliminating that from the budget, you'd save a nickel in taxes for every $1,000 you pay.  So, while cutting the deficit is a good idea, this ain't going to do hardly anything on that front.",kerthard,2025-05-02T05:15:31,5

"I've donated to them recently and plan on doing so again. My worry is if donations aren't enough. There's also the worry that trump's goons may try to stop donations, like what it mentions on the article.",Vardisk,2025-05-02T05:31:05,2
