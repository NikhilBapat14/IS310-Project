"NEW YORK — The Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into real estate transactions involving New York Attorney General Letitia James, according to a person familiar with the case — the first known criminal probe of a law enforcement official who took action against President Donald Trump.  A grand jury in the Eastern District of Virginia has issued subpoenas over a mortgage application in which James attested that she intended to make a single-family home in Norfolk her primary residence, said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation. James’s signature appears at the bottom of a two-page document granting power of attorney to her niece, Shamice Thompson-Hairston, to execute the purchase, according to records obtained by The Washington Post.  James has joined other Democratic state attorneys general to file multiple lawsuits against both Trump administrations, halting some of the president’s key initiatives. She also sued Trump and the Trump Organization over allegations of faulty business practices, winning a[ massive judgment last year ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/02/16/judge-engoron-ruling-trump-ny-civil-fraud-trial/)that totaled in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Trump is appealing.

"Hmm, lied about the number of units to qualify for a residential mortgage. Falsely claimed a different state as her domicile. Falsely listed someone as her spouse. There's a reason she is only saying the claims are baseless.    Whether it's the statute of limitations has ran or she feels it doesn't rise to the level of her being prosecuted, people who think she's innocent need to take a long hard look at their political team blinders.",hooya2007,2025-05-10T16:21:53,1

"All politicians should be held liable for crimes they commit. If James committed fraud, an independent investigation should occur.   And Democrats should record each and every crime committed by Republicans and prosecute them mercilessly if they're ever in power again.

"He has an enormous amount of power and is a hold over from multiple administrations. You can be sure a process is underway to reduce his influence and get him out of his job.
