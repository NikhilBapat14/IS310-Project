"Covid exposed everything. The whole ""No bullying"" scheme became ""Bully your classmates into conforming"" which is what we knew all along.",AppState1981,2025-04-16T07:11:30,13
"This is a big reason most parents are in favor of charter schools. Democrats oppose them so that they can continue to force indoctrinate small children into this kind of garbage. It is a parent's responsibility to decide what their children are exposed to, not the state's.",social_dinosaur,2025-04-16T06:58:37,6
Disgusting. I hope the parents ride roughshod over them in court.,squunkyumas,2025-04-16T04:12:21,8
">Brown argued in an amicus brief to the Supreme Court that “declining to allow opt-outs reflects a determination that, whatever one’s views about whether being L*** is ‘right’ or ‘wrong,’ students must learn to treat L*** people with respect and dignity.”  If this subject was confined to high school students and the classes allowed open discussion of both views, I might agree with Brown. Presenting this to elementary students disguised as ""language arts"" is not about learning ""respect and dignity"", it's about adults bullying your kid into submission. Which is neither respectful nor dignified.",Farmwife64,2025-04-16T06:23:06,6

Because they believe government regulation is required for everything. They simply can't leave education alone even though they fail at every turn.,social_dinosaur,2025-04-16T07:46:22,6
