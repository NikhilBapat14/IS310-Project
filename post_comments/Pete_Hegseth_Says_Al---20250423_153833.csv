"From reporter Arthur Delaney:  In the three months since his confirmation, Pete Hegseth has lost his handpicked chief of staff and fired three other aides in a bizarre front-office meltdown over suspected leaks. That’s on top of the mega-scandal over Hegseth’s use of Signal group chats to share sensitive details about imminent attacks by the U.S. military on Houthi targets in Yemen.  In short, things are not going well.  Hegseth, however, says it’s all part of his plan to shake up a complacent bureaucracy and bring back the “warrior ethos” like he promised to do.

"The idea of destroying everything for the sake of it with the blind expectation that when the dust settles a new order will magically exist is so incredibly stupid and delusional that I really don't even know where to start. These people all seem to believe that if they tear down the system, somehow things will be better. How will things be better if there's no system to make them better? How?",AmbivalentFanatic,2025-04-23T16:23:16,3
