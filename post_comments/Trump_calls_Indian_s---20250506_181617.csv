"I was hoping he'd go for the automatic ""It would have never happened if I was the president...""",russcastella,2025-05-06T18:19:41,17
I’m surprised he didn’t go with ‘It’s Biden’s fault’.,dbuck1964,2025-05-06T18:20:41,9
This is where the world is lucky to have Donald Trump.  He will have a deal between India and Pakistan in 24 hours.  A redeveloped casino strip in Kashmir is probably his opening position for them.,Virtual-Squirrel-725,2025-05-06T18:25:16,9
He thinks it's a shame because he didn't start it and he doesn't know how to get us involved in it.,Machiavvelli3060,2025-05-06T18:21:23,4
"A ""Shame"" is when I leave out my chicken nuggets on the counter instead of putting them in the fridge. Two nuke armed nations going to war seems to be a bit worse than that.",OnlyRise9816,2025-05-06T18:46:53,4
Oh what a shame.  Why does everything sound like it's just spilled milk when he says stuff?  He's like an ongoing persistent mosquito that won't get away from your ear.  Beeeeezzzzz beeeeez I'm annoying and evil beeeeeez ,arilupe,2025-05-06T18:20:39,3
Kashmir-a-Lago  We’ll send all the Kashmiri folks to Gaza. It will be beautiful!,rom_rom57,2025-05-06T19:37:56,3
I'm so glad we have a smart and levelheaded president to consider the nuances of our fragile and crumbling world order,jellofishsponge,2025-05-06T18:26:06,2
It's a true shame because he can't figure out a way to profit off of it.,shoobe01,2025-05-06T18:27:22,2
If I was president there... There'd be no strikes on my first day... 🤦‍♂️  Thanks for the update Reuters.,williamgman,2025-05-06T18:29:49,2

If anyone can handle international relations it’s our stable genius. And little Marco. And his worthless emissaries like Witkoff. Pathetic losers,Responsible-Bird-470,2025-05-06T18:26:23,1

"Using kill-baby-kill and mercantile approach to world diplomacy, Trump will likely force them to buy American manufactured weapons to balance the current trade deficit.",Plastic_Ad_1106,2025-05-06T18:31:17,1
No new wars etc etc.,Funky-Buddah,2025-05-06T19:54:03,1

"Nah more like 24 minutes. And it’ll be the greatest peace deal anyone has ever seen, you’ll never see another peace deal like this one. All those other peace deals that happened before it are absolute disasters, ask anyone they’ll tell you.",twholst,2025-05-06T18:31:42,1
Pakistan is heavily supported by China and India just signed a trade deal with the UK,Wide-Secretary7493,2025-05-06T18:38:21,1
