"Some useful historical reminders from the interview preamble:  >So this is a time of commemoration, and in this time, the president of the United States, Donald Trump, issued a very strange post about the event on the 8th of May. He wrote: > >Many of our allies and friends are celebrating May 8th as Victory Day, but we did more than any other Country, by far, in producing a victorious result on World War II. I am hereby renaming May 8th as Victory Day for World War II and November 11th as Victory Day for World War I. We won both Wars, nobody was close to us in terms of strength, bravery, or military brilliance, but we never celebrate anything—That’s because we don’t have leaders anymore, that know how to do so! We are going to start celebrating our victories again! > >Now, that post was such a perfect crystallization of the Trump style: bombast, boast, all of it making Trump himself the center of a story that he had nothing whatsoever to do with. The statement is unwise and unattractive in all kinds of other ways too. It denigrates the sacrifices and heroism of others. And it turns the tragedy and horror of war into a triumphant narrative that was completely alien to almost all the people who experienced it as nothing but a tale of suffering and waste and cruelty and misery. > >I want to draw attention to something maybe less obvious about what is wrong—what is missing—from the president’s statement. The first is, as so often when Donald Trump talks about American military history, he emphasizes power and success and triumph and military genius, but always lacking is any mention of the values for which Americans fought. America didn’t go into World War II—or even World War I—to be top nation, to beat and dominate others. It went to defend things that Americans regarded as precious, and not only Americans but others too—and one of the measures of how precious those values were, not only to Americans and to others, but to the world that has grown up as a result of the war. > >Because at this interval of eight decades, I think it’s maybe most useful and most necessary not to think about the war that ended in Europe on May 8, or the war overall that ended on September 2 in Tokyo Bay. I think it’s more useful to think about what began the process of reconstruction and reconciliation that occupied the next eight decades: the way in which former enemies became present partners, the way the Germans and the Japanese themselves discovered, in their own defeat, their own liberation because they came to accept the values for which Americans went into battle. > >... > >You know, Winston Churchill described the Battle of Britain, in 1940, as Britain’s finest hour. If Americans are looking for a finest hour of their own, it’s not anything that happened during the war—when America was, by the way, a late entrant. It’s the five, seven years, 10 years after the war, when Americans and others learned from the mistakes after the First World War and built a better world that we still enjoy. Now all of those lessons have been forgotten, and Donald Trump is single-handedly determined to repeat all the mistakes that after the First World War put the world on the path to the Second World War: protectionism, isolationism, narrow nationalism, lack of forbearance, lack of mutual understanding, lack of any understanding of America’s place as a leader—because of its values, because it’s a country that is admired and trusted, not just because it’s a country that is strong and powerful and feared.  This preamble gave some pretty useful historical contrasts and context for what we're seeing now. Completely missing the point of the global conflicts of the 20th century is at this point likely deliberate.  edit: splitting out the interview commentary",Hrmbee,2025-05-07T10:25:54,20

"One highlight from the interview:  >Frum: ... So due process for the disfavored, impunity for the favored. Then a foreign policy that attacks allies and then sympathizes with foreign dictators. Then the reconstruction of the whole American economy along lines that empower the state and create more favor—ability of the state to dispense favors. Attacks on science, medicine, and otherwise objective sources of information. And then, finally, self-enrichment by the president, his family, his friends. > >And your—one of your many great contributions—is to say this last is the binding agent that unites all the others. Can you take it from there and explain how we should think about this? > >Applebaum: So if you look around the world, if you look at what links modern dictators and stipulate that modern dictators have very different ideologies—you know, you have nationalist Russia and Communist China and theocratic Iran and whatever North Korea is and the Bolivarian socialists in Venezuela. And you ask, What is it they have in common? Why do they support one another? Which they do. Why do they help keep one another in power? Which they do. There’s a whole consortium of countries keeping the Venezuelan dictator [Nicolás] Maduro in power, for example, even though they would seem to have nothing in common. > >One of the answers is that they all share an interest in stealing and hiding money and in helping one another evade the sanctions that have been set up to prevent them from doing that and in perpetuating not just their own power but their own wealth. And that’s a—there is now a set of systems that exist, some of which are facilitated by the Western financial world, by the offshore banking havens that we’ve created, and the shell-company system that we created that helps people hide money. But it’s the one thing that they have all in common, and it’s the one thing that they all pursue. > >It’s also true that when you have a declining democracy—or a mixed system, as you had in Russia, for example, in the ’90s—the moment when the regime begins to really earn money is also often the moment when they really feel the need to crack down on civil liberties. Because the most effective protest movements—and Russia is the best example of this—are often the ones that organize around corruption, because people can see and feel corruption. Ordinary people, you don’t need to know—you don’t have to read John Stuart Mill or know the history of the American Constitution, you know, or even have much of an education. You can be living in rural Ukraine or in Somalia and you can intuitively understand that it’s wrong for some people to be able to steal and keep their money, whereas other people are very poor. And so this is often the motivating and organizing idea of antiauthoritarian movements. > >I mean, actually, the Ukrainian revolution of 2014—which was the moment when a lot of young Ukrainians went out on the street; they were waving EU flags; they were calling for an end of their authoritarian regime, which was at that time closely linked to Russia—that was an anti-corruption movement that was classic in this sense. So Ukrainians understood that they were poor because their leaders were rich. They understood that their leaders were tied to Russia. They imagined being part of Europe, being part of the transatlantic world as a way to have the rule of law. And to avoid that—and when they won, this was the thing that panicked Putin because it’s that kind of rebellion and that kind of movement that he’s most afraid of inside his own country. > >And indeed, the one really successful opposition leader in Russia over the last decade was Alexei Navalny. His movement was an anti-corruption movement. His organization was called the Anti-Corruption Foundation. And he was murdered, in essence, for successfully galvanizing Russians around that theme. So this is both the thing that unifies modern dictators, and it’s also the thing that often unifies their opponents. > >And so the fact that the Trump administration is moving so quickly in a kleptocratic direction and beginning to eliminate, one by one, all kinds of norms, defying all kinds of laws, changing existing laws to enable theft, essentially, and to enable corruption should really alarm us because this is very often what precedes a broader crackdown on civil society. Wherever you see a regime that is rapidly accumulating money and is rapidly enriching itself, you will see some kind of resistance movement and some kind of crackdown afterwards. And that’s, I suppose, why I’m so concerned about it.  It's worth listening to (or reading the transcript of) this interview, as it lays out both a summary of what's been happening with the government but also places them in a framework to contextualize this overwhelming number of events and actions by the nation's leaders. This, to be clear, is also a warning that the direction of the country is not one that will be beneficial to most (or even some) but like corrupt regimes everywhere and throughout history, it will be greatly beneficial and enriching to a small handful of people and devastating to everyone else.
