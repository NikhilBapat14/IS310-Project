Russia said it was exploring ways it could break into Signal via the Linked Devices ,Lebarican22,2025-04-24T21:39:35,7
">”The Secretary of Defense's use of communications systems and channels is classified,"" said Parnell. ""However, we can confirm that the Secretary has never used and does not currently use Signal on his government computer.""  Except those times that he did.  But that was then. This is now. Can’t we just let bygones be bygones? And stop squabbling over what is “classified” or “top secret” or “not to be disseminated without proper clearance”? (/s)",swordrat720,2025-04-24T18:27:45,7
"Only reason for this is keeping his communications secret. He should resign, but I'm sure he'll just blame someone else, head to his powder room, and talk about how he's making the military muscular.",moldivore,2025-04-24T17:59:21,5
Someone better powder his nose and fix his runny mascara.  He’s such a crybaby,HereWeGo5566,2025-04-24T18:06:46,5

"Yeah. He had an unauthorized device inside a SCIF. A civilian, former Army officer, should already know that it’s a very big no-no to do that. That he’s done it multiple times tells me that it’s deliberate, not a minor oops. A major whoopsie.",swordrat720,2025-04-24T22:33:28,1
