This nothing should never have been given this job or any job in the administration other than as a stanchion. A nothing Fox weekend host with a booze and anger problem. Great pick.,The_Lone_Apple,2025-04-21T17:00:28,57
These DUI hires have really worked out great!,lnc_5103,2025-04-21T17:24:48,39
"I have so many questions and thoughts about everything surrounding Trump...but WHY does anyone think they'll succeed by throwing their hat in the ring with him? Almost everyone who pledges loyalty to Trump (granted, this DUI hire also brought this on himself), ends up worse off. Trump values no one, and has no loyalty.   It's just bizarre. Go hang out with Lindell and Giuliani, I guess. LOL.",Slr_Pnls50,2025-04-21T17:11:07,22

"Because they're a bunch of nobodies who can't resist a chance at big power and big money, share Trumps complete lack of any moral conscience, like the idea of exercising their racism/sexism. etc on a large scale.     Because they never would have gotten anywhere near this kind of power on their own merit.  It's not hard to understand at all, actually,.  The world never has a shortage of these types who latch onto power brokers. The entire GOP is guilty.
