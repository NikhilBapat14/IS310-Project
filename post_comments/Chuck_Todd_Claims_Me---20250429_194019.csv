"He is 100% correct. They didn't ""miss"" the story. They knew full well what was going on with Biden. They are complicit in the cover up of his mental decline.",lets_shake_hands,2025-04-29T22:33:19,24
"You can’t make this crap up.     First, it’s a right wing conspiracy that Biden had dementia and why isn’t the media covering it.
