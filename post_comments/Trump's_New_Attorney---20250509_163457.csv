"These people who join Trump's administration have to sell their souls.  How do they live with themselves?  Trump is completely mentally ill, unethical, corrupt, and profoundly damaged, so I somewhat understand it, but I don't like it.  The other people are aware enough to know that so many things are terribly wrong...but yet they stay and tow the party line.  Terrible.",Smithy2232,2025-05-09T16:39:50,15

"The ones Trump pardoned? Like the ones who have been involved in an office-involved shooting, a stabbing, and driving the wrong way after a traffic stop resulting in the death of a woman who were very big dangers to the public??",postsshortcomments,2025-05-09T16:55:56,4
"RFK is a slithery piece of shit, but Tulsi Gabbard is the absolute worst of them when it comes to compromising their morals. How can you go from Bernie to Trump? That’s like going from Yoda to Vader.",QuantaviousTheWise,2025-05-09T16:41:56,10
…Trump prefers the humiliation of those that have to publicly rescind their criticism of him.,jimmygee2,2025-05-09T18:23:49,2
"That is what bothers me (I mean, other than the whole insurrectionist terrorism). People who were willing to break down the Capitol building to capture or kill Senators because they were so easily duped --- these are not safe and sane people to let loose in public. Especially not now that they've been absolved of the consequences of their actions and hold grudges.   Releasing the Jan 6 prisoners will be what our children's children's point to in history books and say ""why didnt you impeach or riot then???""",MommyLovesPot8toes,2025-05-10T09:54:02,1
