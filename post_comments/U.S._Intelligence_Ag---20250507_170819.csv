"Seriously, come out and say, hey we are going to do some spying on another country. What is the point of spying if you are going to tell the country you are going to do it?",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-07T17:48:27,55
"I'm waiting for anyone or anything to show persuasive reasons why Canadagate/Greenlandgate is more than the occasional chuckle in the WH promoted to *policy-level drama* by having multiple articles written about each chuckle.
