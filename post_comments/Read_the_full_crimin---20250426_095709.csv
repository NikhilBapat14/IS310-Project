"This just seems absurd and a far stretch of authority on the 'DoJ's"" part. If we go here any judge can be arrested simply by following them around and then twisting the law to fit the crime and then boom arrest them.   This will make the judiciary very political, whatever is left, and violate the separation of powers. This isn't the way and not how this should be handled. Thoughts?.",Cool-Protection-4337,2025-04-26T10:00:37,36
"The judge informed the ICE-deputized militia members they needed a judicial warrant. They said they didn't care. She allowed the defendant to exit through a different, yet public, door. They arrested her for that. It's a flagrant escalation in attacks on the judicial branch, and I hope SCOTUS is listening.",JFJinCO,2025-04-26T10:54:41,60

This is just a test. Just keep pushing the limits to see what they can and can’t get away with. It’s all about how much power they can take with the least resistance.  And they are proving every day they can do what they want when they want and nobody can stop them. So…. Wonder what’s next.,BigDuck777,2025-04-26T23:37:50,2
"I keep saying, the corporate interests better pay attention   This is first step in removing redress for government overreach   Trump can have all your assets if he wants them, and if a judge halts it, they can be arrested   You helped elect a scorpion knowing he was a scorpion, now you better work to squash it before it kills you both (frog and scorpion fable, for those confused)",augustusleonus,2025-04-27T02:41:23,2
"Maybe the judge was wrong but the solution wasn’t to arrest her. It’s a state court. We have no idea what the resources are available to deal with federal agents within a state court. A lot of places including casinos don’t let armed people in even if there are police officers. I don’t blame her for not wanting to use a state court room as an area to have armed federal agents detain suspects.   I would be an angry as a litigant to have my court hearing delayed while federal law enforcement goes on a witch hunt in the court room after an immigrant. Federal law enforcement was childish and abusive. If they needed to arrest this guy so badly, get a hold of him while he is in a jail cell and not in a state court room. Have him transferred from the jail cell into federal custody.   The Trump regime is just a group of bullies showing off for MAGA media and naive voters looking to harm immigrants. Under no circumstances should state or federal court proceeding be interfered with by the executive branch. The Constitution makes the federal agents actions reprehensible.",FiveUpsideDown,2025-04-26T16:07:34,3
She was released into her own recognizance last evening.  ,Complex_Anteater6528,2025-04-26T11:07:15,6
I think she has a civil case against these federal agents for Color of Law violations. I just don’t think armed federal agents can bring weapons into either state or federal court house. The court houses have their own armed law enforcement. Most places with their own armed law officers don’t allow other armed officers in their facilities without permission. I don’t think prisons let law enforcement enter with weapons. The judge had every right to not let non-court house officers come into her court room to arrest an immigrant.,FiveUpsideDown,2025-04-26T16:34:04,4
"Pretty bad, this happened in her court house though. Used to be certain respect given to judges on that. I don't see how she violated the spirit of the law. They should have been waiting outside and none of this would be an issue. Really I peg this all on the DoJ.      Kinda weird the DoJ turns evil like in harry potter when the bad guys control the ministry. Never thought I would see the day tbh.",Cool-Protection-4337,2025-04-26T10:05:43,23
Doesn't seem to me that she broke the law at all.   This is just ICE and the Trump admin trying to scare others into not upholding the law out of fear of being arrested.,Cat_herder_81,2025-04-26T10:17:53,18
I don't think she broke the law. You know these guys had no warrant for the man in question. She was preventing an individual from being kidnapped by unidentified men.,PNW4theWin,2025-04-26T10:46:42,14
"It's not clear to me that she actually broke any laws at all.   She pissed off some ICE goons by not assisting them illegally detain someone. They wrote up ""charges"" that are paper thin, and will not lead to any conviction, of any actual crime, in any actual court.",sp0rkah0lic,2025-04-26T14:18:20,6
The judge wasn't wrong. You need a judicial warrant. They did not have that. The executive is trying to usurp the judicial. We are in a lawless state.,dankdeeds,2025-04-26T19:48:29,7
Thanks for the explanation.,Big-Plankton-4484,2025-04-26T17:35:58,2
"IMO, it's fear and blue wall bullshit.   - When the ""good guys"" are in charge, there's concern for being held accountable for your actions in the unlikely event that one of your peers snitch.  - When the ""bad guys"" are in charge, there's no fear for being held accountable for anything _other_ than snitching.  It completely changes the power dynamics between the ~~good~~ well-meaning cops and the bad cops out in the field.",Grandpa_No,2025-04-26T10:16:20,8
I have real problems have different groups of armed police agents in a court house. There needs to be worked out in advance which agency is in charge.,FiveUpsideDown,2025-04-26T16:09:45,1
"I think that if ICE had not informed the judge or court their presence, then their suspected presence was only rumor, and the judge could do whatever she liked.",wheezer123,2025-04-26T10:38:31,3
"Maybe she did but I wonder if ICE agents broke rules about being armed in a court house. The ICE agents were also disruptive. I know in the courts I go into you have all types of archaic rules and silly rules to follow. Individual judges in their own court rooms have broad discretion to be abusive in the name of judicial discretion. Here’s a cite to a case where a federal judge closed a public trial to the public. https://www.baltimorebrew.com/2024/01/26/by-turns-testy-and-tearful-nick-mosby-takes-the-stand-and-accepts-the-blame/  As far aa I know, no action as taken against this judge.

"Hmm... I could see that as true for the lobby areas of the courthouse, but is that also true for her courtroom? I would think it's up to her discretion as to who she allows in during a proceeding.   Not trying to argue, just curious about any gray areas.",PNW4theWin,2025-04-26T11:12:06,8
"If you read the complaint, that is exactly what ICE was doing. Waiting for his case to be over and arresting him in the public space outside the courtroom. They even specified that they do so because it is safer as they've gone thoigh metal dectectors and have nowhere to escape easily.    The judge managed to sneak him through a non-public area and out a backdoor which lead to a foot pursuit.   It added danger to the whole process. If they dont charge her, then it de facto becomes legal for judges to help people evade arrest that way.",ChesterfieldPotato,2025-04-26T11:49:53,-9
but they have no warrant so how is he evading arrest?  edit: A judge has authority of their court. To say the an administrative memo that they call a warrant means the executive branch can enter and arrest whomever they want without impunity is wholly stamping on separation of powers. “yeah you can do your little court but we the executive will be in here up your you know what ready to arrest you for anything we don’t like”. Yeah that’s gonna work out great for maintaining a democracy. /s,LongLiveFDR,2025-04-26T11:58:18,8
"They did have a valid administrative warrant and they even showed it to the judge.    Also, you dont need a warrant to arrest someone. How do you think people get arrested for shoplifting? Bar fights? Do police just wait there for hours and days waiting for a warrant before being able to arrest someone for a crime?   ICE, as far as I can tell, did everything right. ",ChesterfieldPotato,2025-04-26T12:02:11,-11
An administrative warrant is not a real judicial warrant.   https://www.motionlaw.com/the-difference-between-judicial-and-administrative-warrants/  edit: so if you’re saying they don’t need a warrant then what is ICE arresting the person for even? Are you sincerely here saying ICE can go rounding people up?,LongLiveFDR,2025-04-26T12:04:22,10
ICE is doing absolutely nothing right.,LadyChatterteeth,2025-04-26T12:54:29,3
"Yes, the same way a police officer can arrest a shoplifter when they find them committing an offense, they don't need a judge's warrant to do so.  An ICE agent can arrest people in the US subject to deportation without a judicial warrant.  How do you think ICE arrests people they catch crossing illegally?  DO you think they just follow the people around for hours and days at a time until they get a judge to approve of their ability to arrest them?",ChesterfieldPotato,2025-04-26T12:30:11,-6
"Arresting someone actively committing a crime is different than arresting someone who is simply going about their day. If what ICE was doing is legal, it means ICE can walk up to ANY person ANYWHERE in the US and simply arrest them, without a warrant, without probable cause.   In addition, in MANY jurisdictions, it’s illegal for ICE to arrest immigrants in or around the courthouse (in order to ensure the immigrants can safely pursue a variety of proceedings without fear of being snatched up). (But I don’t know if this particular state/city/courthouse has this law)",Austin_Peep_9396,2025-04-26T12:48:46,6
"Wow, it’s truly wild to see people advocate for gestapo. I don’t like loyalists.",LongLiveFDR,2025-04-26T15:43:24,1
"1. In this case they were arresting someone for whom they did have probable cause in the form of their administrative warrant.  They knew who they were arresting and for what cause. They did so in a public setting.  Notice how no one is contesting that the guy ICE arrested wasn't lawfully arrested when they grabbed him outside the courthouse?    2. ICE can detain/arrest people by walking up to them. It is almost exactly as you describe as ""'walk up to ANY person ANYWHERE in the US"" An example would be a border farmer calling in suspicious people or someone calling in an illegal worker at a jobsite. Ice can do raids on workplaces where they have suspicion that there are people there illegally. ICE could respond, talk to the people and arrest them without a warrant for being in the US illegally. They don't need a judge's approval.  it is no different than a police officer arresting someone for a crime.  It doesn't mean they are guilty, but they don't need a judge to tell them who they can and cannot arrest.  It happens every single day.  No warrant required, not even administrative one.  The public setting of their courthouse is treated no differently than a public field near a farmer's house or a jobsite.  3. I urge you to read the article and familiarize yourself with ICE's powers of arrest and detention.",ChesterfieldPotato,2025-04-26T13:09:40,-1
"You’re ignoring the fact that this was not an arrest warrant, and without the need for this, ICE can literally walk up to YOU (and, the way they are running things right now, they can deport you without due process and lock you up in a foreign prison EVEN if you are a US citizen that has done nothing wrong). Lots of people are saying “they’re illegal immigrants”, but that’s not the point. Until due process is restored, the administration can use this process to arrest, deport, and imprison ANYONE they want for ANY reason they choose. That’s not American. That’s a dictatorship. And it needs to stop.",Austin_Peep_9396,2025-04-26T14:07:25,4
"1. They dont need an arrest warrant. They ahve never needed an arrest warrant.    2. This is nothing new. This isnt related to Trump and has been done for decades   3. ICE always could deport people who werent US citizens or prove their citizneship. Again, not new to Trump   4. Im not going to speculate on things that havent occured l, like US citizens being sent to overseas jails   5. Even after his arrest, he still has due process before deportation.    6. Judges arent immune to breaking the law   7. Youre out of your depth",ChesterfieldPotato,2025-04-26T15:39:37,-1
