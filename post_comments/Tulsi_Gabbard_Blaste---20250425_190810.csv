"I look at MAGA culties like her and wonder where she'll be in five or ten years.  If the future is a world where Trump is no longer a political factor and the culties don't have a leader, does the GOP normalize somewhat to what used to be normal for the GOP?  And if the culties are marginalized, do people like Gabbard pivot to pass off as mainstream GOP?  Does she think that she can pretend her past (current) actions didn't exist?  I know that's a lot of ""ifs"".  But these people are relatively young and society will undoubtedly swing to the left again at some point.",So_spoke_the_wizard,2025-04-25T19:51:56,22
