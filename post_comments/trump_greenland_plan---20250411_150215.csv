"So this is what we’ve come to. They’re willing to give free handouts to other countries to bribe them into joining the empire, while we get nothing. Dumbasses can’t even do “America first” properly.",Alex72598,2025-04-11T15:20:13,37
"If this is a yearly payment, then the Republicans want to set up Universal Basic Income (UBI) for Greenland?  Republican Logic:  >UBI for People in Greenland = Good  >UBI for Everyone Else = Marxism",mlawus,2025-04-11T15:23:54,13
"Dear citizens of Greenland, take the money and then tell him to fuck off anyways, and when he asks for it back for not ""upholding the deal"" or whatever, tell him you can't return it because you ""don't know where it is""",Zealousideal-Fun-415,2025-04-11T15:31:32,10
Will King Don offer healthcare to Greenland? I think we should get healthcare first,aluminumdisc,2025-04-11T15:05:47,6
He’d have a much better shot of acceptance if he offered to let every Greenlander kick him in the nuts instead.,YurtMcnurty,2025-04-11T15:45:46,6

"Hmm.. the title is misleading the best.  The article said that the payment ""matching the subsidies that Denmark sends to Greenland each year.""  So, at best matching if it is paid annually.  At worst, it is a one-time payment which can severely screwed the resident (assuming no more subsidy.""",InquiringMind14,2025-04-11T15:18:38,1
The idea of cutting services here but paying off Greenlanders 10k annually (who would even trust this) is so insulting.,WarofCattrition,2025-04-11T15:36:41,12
We'll definitely get two Democrat senators and a Democrat representative.,Ssshizzzzziit,2025-04-11T19:40:57,2

Interesting assumption!,DogPlane3425,2025-04-11T19:07:17,1
I don’t see anything about annual payments.  It sounds like s one-time buyout.  The Greenlanders would likely come out far worse off with fewer social services.,Wet_Side_Down,2025-04-11T19:21:11,8
