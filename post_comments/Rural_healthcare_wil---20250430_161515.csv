Their voting history indicates they have no problem traveling hours for medical care. Or maybe that it's they keep voting for people who lie to them.,sugarlessdeathbear,2025-04-30T16:20:22,60
"Well, I hope the folks in Kentucky enjoys that shit they voted for. Most of them also bought the merch of their own demise and clad their houses with it.  Good luck, America.",Mustard_Gap,2025-04-30T16:25:17,39
"Growing up, I heard my southern relatives talk about 'people getting Medicaid *that did not deserve it*' and ""Medicare/Medicaid was never meant to support this amount of people'.Â    These conversations usually began with how their own coverage seemed *slim* or that they would probably be receiving more benefits if *so many people* 'who shouldn't be on it' we're not on it'.   They hold these dual mentalities because that's how it's sold to them. When they hear aÂ  Republican speaking about 'fixing broken systems' and 'reducing fraud' they already have a mental picture of who will be subject to any restrictions. And it ain't themselves.",citizenjones,2025-04-30T20:25:04,11

"As a registered nurse, I was happy to hear that Kamala Harris, during her campaign claimed that she was going to bolster rural health care and small hospitals in rural areas.   Iâ€™m assuming that Kentucky was not interested in any of that because they overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump who is giving Kentucky what he said he would be giving Kentucky.",thomport,2025-04-30T20:17:43,8
