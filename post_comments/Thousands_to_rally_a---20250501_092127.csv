We are disjointed and scattered. We’re dependent on local organizers. The groups are too small.   - What do we want? Regardless if your issue:  Impeach. Convict. Remove.

"Yes… but… there were not three million protestors in a single, unified event. There were three million spread throughout many smaller affiliated events across the country. This highlights the difficulty of the situation. There are many of us sundered by the vast geographic realities of this country. This is importantly, because it makes it very difficult to use protests as a show of force. Those have to happen on local levels to feel “real,” so if we want 3 million reported, three million probably have to show up in DC or Palm Beach, not their local capital. Otherwise it is “individual protests across the country saw in some cases thousands of demonstrators each.”   It’s unfortunately not a distinction without a difference, but it doesn’t mean anyone is doing it wrong either. It’s just a reflection of reality.",yesrushgenesis2112,2025-05-01T13:35:08,25

" Not American, I have no horse in this whole Rep v Dem debate, I don’t t like Trump, in fact I think he is a moron but seeing that footage in the link, I can’t help but wondering, where the fuck are the people protesting, that Chicago “rally” footage seemed to have barely a few hundred protestors. The U.S. has a population of over 300 million, meaning there’s less than 1% of the people in the streets demonstrating.   I have a really hard time trusting American news and Reddit ever since the “Trump rallies are empty and no one is attending” reporting during elections, because we all know how that ended.   When I look at the Reddit headlines in this sub you could get the impression that Americans are rejecting Trumps administration on a large level but then seeing the footage never really backs that image, we have bigger rallies in Europe and our populations is way smaller than that of the U.S. ( not as a whole but each country ).",Istvaarr,2025-05-01T16:02:17,1

"This is true. I passed by a protest on my way “home” and there were probably a couple thousand max. Which made it really funny when I saw a gaggle of policemen on bikes in a horde at the gas station. To be fair though they also seemed confused as to why they were there.   But yeah, the sparseness or relative lack of density is a problem. Makes the turn outs seem smaller and in turn inspires less courage in others to act.   But people are protesting. There are people against this.   If I get deported to El Salvador for being homeless hopefully I’ve got some of these guys in the cells next to me before I die.",ChilledParadox,2025-05-01T18:03:38,2

"We don't need rowdier. We need funnier.   JD's couch fucking rumor was the best angle Democrats had in the run up to the election. When they capitalized on that and made jokes about it in stump speeches, those quotes soared across social media.

WE need to get our message out in a language the American public understands: low brow humor and selacious rumors. Nancy Pelosi isn't going to suddenly start making diaper jokes.

"Clicks. The party that produces more of these is the party that can control the national conversation.  Republicans doing and saying insane shit produces more clicks (and thus revenue) than Democrats complaining about Republicans can ever produce.  You want to flood the zone?  Go to *insane* lengths to entice the media to run your story vs the latest Republican blunder.  Politics has never been more of a popularity and name recognition contest as it is in the TikTok era.  As is the case, Democrats are doomed until they rid the party of folks who've never participated in social media. At this moment, the leadership has NEVER been more boring and out of touch.

"Also, we need messengers who can command attention. We're starting to get the tiniest bit better here, but...for some reason around the start of the 21st century, we Dems pivoted to prioritizing elderly coastal lawyers turned Washington bureaucrats for all our spokespeople. That sort of candidate hasn't been great since maybe the early 19th century?  Our predecessors about a hundred years ago were immigrant laborer urbanites organizing around bars and taverns--that's half of why conservatives pushed prohibition. Do you think they used their media training and political degrees to pitch politics, or did they rely on good old-fashioned charisma that probably played loosey goosey with the facts? Those people would've laughed 99% of the Dem party messengers out of the room.  We keep pretending this attention economy shift is this modern shift, an anomaly. When really, it's that hyper-bureaucratic-insider failed experiment that's the anomaly and the electorate's behavior here is very historically consistent--though reinforced through technology.  Most of the people we've been sending out to advocate for us never would've made good television at any point in history I'm aware of.",Sminahin,2025-05-01T12:07:05,5
