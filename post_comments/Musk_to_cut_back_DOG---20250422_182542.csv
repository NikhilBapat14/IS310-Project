DOGE “work” is more like plundering and siphoning taxpayer money into his own pockets ,jesuisapprenant,2025-04-22T18:29:57,8
"How does the CEO of a company which depends on selling products to the public all over the world decide getting into politics and helping to elect a tariff crusader would be good for that company?  Guys, I think Elon might not actually be very smart.",smersh101,2025-04-22T18:44:22,4

"But legally Musk has nothing at all to do with the fake ""department:"" on paper, the fascist regime has only an extremely limited advisory status. What Musk did and is doing was and are many thousands of felonies because he is not allowed to do what he did.  Meanwhile, only Congress creates, approves, and funds new and existing federal departments.  The question I see now and then on ""social media"" that I think is valid, is ""What has tRump done that the Kremlin would not have done to destroy the USA?""",Still_Mix3277,2025-04-22T18:32:10,2
Oh r we supposed to feel sorry for him after he slashed our government!!,Massive-Awareness701,2025-04-22T18:47:49,2
Bullshit. Don't fall for it... he's just pretending to step back because his 130 days are up. ,StrangerFew2424,2025-04-22T18:50:45,2

I demand that he and his whole team (save any whistleblowers) be subject to being zapped with one of those mind-erasing beams from Men in Black. He's seen too much.,SpoppyIII,2025-04-22T19:03:00,1
He thinks going back will increase sales 😂,thomas_brock13190,2025-04-22T22:04:21,1
Sounds like a plan. Then the rest of us will continue to cut back on our Tesla spending until he agrees to step completely away from DOGE.   Almost there people…. Almost there,ButterscotchLow8950,2025-04-22T22:30:02,1
"I will never support anything that elon is a part of. He is a racist nazi and can fuck right off.. I hope tesla fails big time, or the board votes him out. It would be nice if he lost everything and went to prison... but justice is dead in this country, so that will never happen. Bust i can hope for is that he looses lots of money and is relegated to a normal billionair status..",Spicydooky,2025-04-22T22:36:47,1
It's still a shitty car. Like him leaving Government doesn't change that fact.,thegoodnamesrgone123,2025-04-22T18:29:20,6
