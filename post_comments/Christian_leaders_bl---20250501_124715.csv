"It's easy for anyone on Trump's side to dismiss these kinds of rebukes by saying, ""Oh, but they're not REAL Christians,"" or ""they're not part of the TRUE denomination."" As someone who used to be Southern Baptist, that is exactly how these people think. The only opinions that matter are those from people in your very specific denomination. Anyone else is ""not an actual Christian.""  And if they ARE part of your denomination but still disagree, they are ""backslidden.""",crkokinda,2025-05-01T12:51:51,45

"People who actually read the Bible and try to properly understand it will tell you any, and everyone, can be saved if they truly want to be. The Bible, specifically the New Testament, specifically teaches love and acceptance regardless of background and heritage. Hence the reason Jesus hung out with tax collectors, prostitutes, the sick, and the needy. At the end of the day, it isn’t humanity’s job to judge, we were told to accept any and everyone.  This crap the Angry Orange is pushing, and the people refusing to, you know, actually read and understand the Bible, are completely missing the point of what most of the New Testament of the Bible tries to teach, and misunderstands aspects of the Old Testament because they think some the things that happened there means God wants us to hate people who aren’t like us.",TheOneWhoIsTryin,2025-05-01T15:45:32,3
That depends. The dogma of most denominations says so. Those who identify as Christians because they want to be special (chosen) probably disagree.,barryvm,2025-05-01T13:52:56,2

Trump is apparently Presbyterian but he never goes to church and knows nothing about the Bible. It’s as cultural as possible.,jgoble15,2025-05-01T19:20:45,2
They also believe that God makes his presence known to everyone. So those people are also going to hell according to them. The most traumatic parts of my life is thanks to the Southern Baptist Church. Biggest group of hypocrites I've ever been around and as a whole they value money as much as their God. Trump is a perfect match for that group!,Bunch_Busy,2025-05-01T14:51:41,2
"That's awful. Pope Francis was a beautiful man and a great example of humility and charitable outreach. I might not *completely* agree with the pope as a concept, but I really respected him. God rest his soul. :(",AlkaSelse,2025-05-01T18:59:17,1
He was imperfect but he did his best. I hope the next one is as good. I’m not Roman Catholic either but it’s still good to see leaders that people can look up to. God knows we are lacking in that in the US right now.,wokehouseplant,2025-05-01T19:02:18,2
