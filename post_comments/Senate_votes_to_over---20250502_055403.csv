"I mean this is the kind of shit why people aren’t having babies - blatant disregard for the planet and for human health   Countries all across the world are thinking about all the economic reasons or want to blame feminism for why people aren’t having them, but I think there’s a deep subconscious understanding that the planet is inhospitable and humans are consciously or unconsciously adjusting their reproduction accordingly.   Degradation and pollution of the environment has been going on for centuries, awareness of climate change has been going on for decades, and we’re seeing the effects of it in real time even if we don’t admit it to ourselves.",loud-oranges,2025-05-02T07:02:14,14

"Think of how dumb it is that rfkjr was an environmental lawyer but is not in charge of the epa but in charge of ruining our health in other ways? And he fought against things like this in his career,  but is now freely working with trump to ruin our air and land.",Designer-Contract852,2025-05-02T06:38:40,6

I swear they want to kill off the poor because then with less people they won't have to worry about climate change. Then they want to arrest anyone who doesn't have their viewpoint to have us as prisoner/slaves for us to work the factories. It's some diabolical shit that's being talked about and everyone is too busy to notice.,chimarya,2025-05-02T06:23:26,4
"> The rule requires that industrial facilities — often chemical plants, oil refineries, and other industrial factories classified as ""major"" sources of toxic air pollution — always maintain strict pollution controls.  Well this is uncalled for. /s",IDontGoHardIGoHome,2025-05-02T06:06:30,3

"I can’t help but agree. Between this, decimating our federal health infrastructure, stopping testing of chicken for salmonella, suspending quality control of milk, taking away fluoride in the water, denigrating well established vaccines, inhibiting research into new vaccines, doing away with regulation of PFAS in drinking water, etc. (I could go on for far too long)…yeah, the end goal really does appear to be a purge of the poor.",madscientesse,2025-05-02T08:14:48,3
"I am an environmental consultant, and those contaminants have some of the lowest allowable cleanup levels for soil and groundwater. Lead, PAHs, chlorinated hydrocarbons, PCBs, furans, and dioxins… are you fucking kidding me?!   For instance for anyone not aware, dioxins have cleanup levels in the parts per trillion range. But yeah, sure, we should be breathing that in without having to try to clean it out of our factory/incinerator exhaust… sure.   All that said, we burn a lot of trash in this country, and dioxins/furans are a natural byproduct of that. Some of this falls on our own damn backs… figuratively and literally.",tackle_bones,2025-05-02T07:13:47,8
