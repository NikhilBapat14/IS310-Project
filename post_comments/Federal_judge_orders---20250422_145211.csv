LOL Trump is such a fucking loser,smp7401,2025-04-22T15:07:08,105
I don’t think he’s going to do that. And the problem is there are no Republicans with a backbone to do their job and make him.,notleave_eu,2025-04-22T15:06:08,38

Donald Trump is destroying everything so he could Turn America into an authoritarian government.  Donald Trump must be removed ASAP.,reddittorbrigade,2025-04-22T16:18:41,16
"Watch as Trump blatantly tells them ""No."" And then nothing happens because the court has no enforcement power without the executive branch's cooperation.",LordSiravant,2025-04-22T15:10:05,12
Yeah.  Trump is going to get right on that.,Ceiling_Cat_Quits,2025-04-22T18:09:02,2
he doesn’t give a shit about laws since the law never pertained to him,supercali45,2025-04-23T02:22:38,1

So is Kerri Lake,Ruby5000,2025-04-22T15:22:51,43
Ehhhh... I feel like I'm seeing some tiny cracks in the shells these Republicans crawled into. Every poll that shows Trump losing support gives them that little bit more confidence that opposing him doesn't guarantee a loss in future elections.,MommyLovesPot8toes,2025-04-22T22:42:23,6
"Not that it will be any different outcome, but the fact that the court has ruled this way means that the Executive has violated the law. Congress should be upset by that fact and should hold the Executive accountable. It's not just the courts making orders, the legislature should hold their feet to the fire for defying their laws AND the courts' directives.",mitrie,2025-04-22T19:26:37,5
I've heard they can deputize someone (or ones) to make an arrest on a contempt charge.,JugDogDaddy,2025-04-22T21:27:50,3
About time…! Can we all agree these people are not patriots but subservient psychopaths that do not have our nation’s best interests at hand!,Kindly-Counter-6783,2025-04-23T01:33:53,3
"Yeah, at some point a large portion of republicans are going to realize that they’re going to need to go against Trump if they hope to keep their seat in Congress. I’m sure there are those that are MAGA for life but honestly, fuck them let them dig their own graves supporting this lunatic of a President.",Renegade-Ginger,2025-04-23T02:45:51,3
"I'm in a purplish-red area that went red in 2024. We're a fairly small area in the suburbs. My congressional rep started out full, open MAGA. But for the last 2 months, she's been dodging the press and stripping her website of mentions of trump. Then on Saturday, my little area lit up with protests. She's gotta see the writing on the wall that she won't win in 2026 unless she divorces herself from MAGA. (Presuming, of course, that were not fully Authoritarian by then)",MommyLovesPot8toes,2025-04-23T04:34:03,2
