"Four Perspectives:  1. He sucks. 2. He's shit. 3. He has no fucking clue what he's doing (much like bankrupting multiple casinos). 4. His administration is a fucking three ringed circus sideshow, of bullshit, incompetent, fucking bootlickers.",MoveMitchGetOutDaWay,2025-04-26T02:43:38,23
"This poll feels like a turning point, not just another dip, but the first real signs that voters across the spectrum are starting to push back on Trump’s overreach. For years, his support base has seemed almost impervious to chaos. But now? The cracks are showing. The numbers aren’t just “bad.” They’re deeply revealing. Voters still support some of Trump’s core policies, including deportation, tariffs, and even slashing spending. But when they’re executed with zero restraint, that support collapses. People wanted a fighter, not a wrecking ball.  Look at immigration: 54% still support deporting undocumented immigrants, yet a majority disapprove of how he’s handling it. That’s not ideological opposition, that’s frustration with extremes. Same with executive power. When voters say a president is “scary” or “chaotic,” that’s not left vs. right, that’s an instinctive human reaction to leadership that feels dangerous.  And the economy? If his tariffs really do tip us into recession, this 42% approval rating might end up being the high point.  Bottom line: The Trump brand was built on the illusion of control, a strongman with a plan. But governing is different from campaigning. You can’t spin results forever. And this poll shows that even some of his own voters are waking up to that.",fulltrendypro,2025-04-26T02:27:58,14
Trump is a Russian asset.  Putin is an agent of chaos.  His goal is to destabilize the West.,Caraes_Naur,2025-04-26T03:06:16,12
Bottom line Trump is just a disgrace. Traitor and he has no idea what he is doing besides scamming America for money. Polls are on point. America each day is going bad and hopefully something changes.,SirMasterDrew,2025-04-26T02:32:22,6
My perspective is people are finally realizing the emperor has no clothes.,invalidpassword,2025-04-26T04:22:53,2
Fifth perspective on Trumps poll numbers: They don’t f*^%ing matter. Americans are stuck with Trump. Elections matter. Get out and actually vote in the midterms.,blue_quark,2025-04-26T08:59:32,2

"Those numbers will change sooner or later.  They can't have them disagreeing with the official results when Trump runs for his third term after all.  I'm not sure there is enough legitimate government left to do anything about it, so correcting course is going to require the average American to do more than just get out to vote.",lordagr,2025-04-26T03:50:36,1
The Americans seem to like him better than they liked Obama back in 2014 though:  [https://www.politico.com/story/2014/10/poll-obama-approval-rating-111902](https://www.politico.com/story/2014/10/poll-obama-approval-rating-111902),fabe1haft,2025-04-26T02:47:31,0
"That's all great, but polls don't change the fact that he'll be President for another **3 years and 9 months**.  Flipping the House next year seems likely, hopefully the Senate, too.  That will act as a check on his power, but there will be a ton of damage between now and then and it's not clear right now if there's anything that can stop it.",banksy_h8r,2025-04-26T03:56:32,9
The only poll that matters is one that shows 2/3 of the Senate is willing to convict and remove him from office. Otherwise vibes don't change the reality of our situation.,PinchesTheCrab,2025-04-26T11:09:43,2
I'd like to point out that South Korea just took care of a problem like this without bothering with a vote.,Only_Chans,2025-04-26T11:14:00,2
Americans should be excited about the prospect of Obama running again in 2028.,LucynSushi,2025-04-26T03:06:22,3

Greetings from r/ukpolitics.   We've taken a lot of shit for constantly flipping our prime minister.   But I start to feel pretty good about our political system when I look at the US right now.   edit: Sorry about the crimes of Banksy btw.,textzenith,2025-04-26T04:37:11,6
