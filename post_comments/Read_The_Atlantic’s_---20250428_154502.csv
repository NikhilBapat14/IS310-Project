"Shockingly enough this interview is with Jeffrey Goldberg, the very same guy who reported the Signalgate story.  Apparently Trump’s lust for attention overrides his desire to spite his enemies.",Aryeh98,2025-04-28T15:47:00,27

"I’m sure it is incredibly insightful with lots of political theory and philosophy leading off a deep dive into his policy and its ramifications for medium and long term American success, as well as a clear framing of what ‘success’ is, as envisioned by him.   Yet, I will still decline your invitation to read it.",TSAOutreachTeam,2025-04-28T16:03:49,4

"Actually the article is not bad.  Goldberg is focused and blunt, yet not in a rude way.  Trump is unusually agreeable, faking 'the wise old man', and - as usual - failing.  About quarter-way through the varnish peels back when you realize Trump has already announced he knows Goldberg was right and smart in how he exposed Hegseth and Waltz as blundering  incompetents, yet stubbornly announces ""He's safe"", and refuses to do anything about it.  On Hegseth: ""He's going through something.""  Like Americans should accept that as an excuse for breaking every rule of of military conduct in one go...AND LYING ABOUT IT.  Especially when they've ALL been busy FIRING every COMPETENT military in that Looney-Loomer's book - for ZERO reason.  (As an aside: Trump's press sec'y come through as the 'Karen' / Agnes Kravitz that she is.  They no longer brag about Hegseth handling the Houthis,  while Houthis - poorest people on the planet - carry on shooting down $200Mill US Reaper drones at will.  Not bowed, I would say.  The only Shock n Awe is that blunder boy Hegseth still has a job)  Doesn't take long for Trump's What-aboutism (Biden, Austin), Big Lies (""my third term...""), and vindictiveness (media, judges, etc) take over the interview, no matter how 'zen' he tries to appear.  if written interviews had smell-o-vision, it would take a gas mask to get through to the end of this one.  I held my nose, but glad Goldberg at least had the courage to try to show what's in that stinky old diaper in full daylight.  He did try.  The stink overwhelmed.",XSinTrick6666,2025-04-28T17:29:53,6
"Thank you for the gift article. I read the interview and as usual Trump damns himself, and I know that reporters have to tread carefully with him in order to keep access, but damn…we’re in a constitutional, nationwide, worldwide crisis, and I feel like the media is wearing slippers to a minefield.   Trump is being allowed to glide over the most difficult topics without much pushback , e.g., him saying that of course he’ll follow court orders, IF he believes they’re “legal.” It’s not the first time he’s said that, and it plays right into his EO on the Justice Department—that they alone can “interpret” the law.   And again, Trump is allowed to claim that the people being deported were all criminals, or were all here without documentation, when we all know that deportees here legally, studying, working with green cards, are being detained and deported, and many of them without any prior notice. Visas are being revoked with no notice or short notice and then the holders of those Visas are being labeled as “criminals, here illegally” because the system made it so, at least on paper.   Trump, standing in his office with Charles Schwab, bragging about him making billions after Trump’s stock market plummet and rise. The crypto/meme coin scandal. The emoluments clause and how that seems to have gone by the wayside. The million dollar dinners sold to dine with the President. The new “Executive Club” that promises access for a $500K fee. So much more.  I’m old enough to remember how the news media handled Watergate and Nixon. It was unrelenting, factual, and decisive. And compared to what Trump’s administration is doing, it feels like child’s play.",70sBurnOut,2025-04-28T17:48:25,5

"Dude thinks 1 Trillion is close to Trillions. That hundreds of billions can just be rounded to trillions.   “Look, we lost trillions of dollars last year on trade with this guy [Biden], trillions of dollars. And every year, we lose trillions. Trillions, right? Hundreds of billions, but basically trillions; we went over the ledge into the T word”",tngling,2025-04-28T16:22:42,3
What would be the point? He lies like most people breathe. There's absolutely no value in interviewing him in the first place and even less in reading one.,Tyrannical-Botanical,2025-04-28T16:07:14,2

">On Thursday, April 24, I joined my colleagues Ashley Parker and Michael Scherer in the White House to interview President Donald Trump. The story behind this meeting is a strange one, told in their new Atlantic cover story, which you can read here.  And some other reporters who were assigned to Trump in his first term.  Scherer had a moment he went a bit viral for getting Trump to give him an interview in one of Trump's dining rooms of a Trump golf resort - just impromptu because the adults left Trump alone for a moment.    Parker was in the White House Press Corp his first term and has worked along with Peter Baker and Philip Rucker.

I can't.  Just skimming through and he's bragging about the gold leaf decorations he says came from MAL and considering adding something to the ceiling like a fancy chandelier or some shit.  It's not HIS house.. and I can only imagine him doing a mural on the ceiling with warriors like he has in Trump Tower.    Like, seriously - this guy even in a transcript sounds old, feeble, and out of his mind.",Brief_Amicus_Curiae,2025-04-28T16:00:33,15

"The Atlantic does anything but normalize Trump. This article has an interesting dynamic because of how much Trump hates The Atlantic, and their editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg. And he's the one interviewing Trump in this article.
