Putting the 80 something with cancer in charge because he earned it by still being alive worked out well.,ksbla,2025-04-28T12:47:59,49
"this is the guy they gave it to over AOC so he could play with the xbox before he died, right?",ritwikjs,2025-04-28T12:47:37,38

Let's go AOC,jimmydean885,2025-04-28T12:46:44,17
The replacement pick is going to tell a lot about whether the party is listening to constituents and the country or if they are going to keep the standard quo going.,LaMarr-Bruister,2025-04-28T12:50:29,7
I have such little faith in the process that I'm fully expecting them to replace him with a Republican and say 'what are you going to do about it?' edit: oh they skipped Eleanor Holmes Norton and went to some old white old dude instead.  My point stands,darsynia,2025-04-28T13:05:42,7
"Right now, I 100% believe that everything worked out for the best because AOC is on a record breaking tour with Sanders lighting a fire under americans against oligarchy. And as a result she will likely primary schumer and end up in a much better position to help americans.",DaydreamsForFun,2025-04-28T13:27:41,5

She can't anymore. She's on a different committee.,Ut_Prosim,2025-04-28T13:43:50,6
"His No 2 on the committee is Jasmine Crockett. But Connolly is giving leadership duties to Stephen Lynch, the 3rd most senior D on the panel.",Greedy_Switch_6991,2025-04-28T12:51:28,19
She's not on Oversight anymore - couldn't get a waiver after she was selected for the exclusive Energy & Commerce committee.,Greedy_Switch_6991,2025-04-28T12:49:57,10
"Looks like they're [skipping Eleanor Holmes Norton in favor of Stephen Lynch](https://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2025/04/more-sad-tales-from-the-gerontocracy), so make of that what you will.",darsynia,2025-04-28T13:12:31,9
Doesn't change the fact that they're replacing him with another ancient white man instead of the second in line who is a black woman. We all know this is done on purpose.,mental_dissonance,2025-04-28T15:09:45,3
"She's on a different committee now and cannot serve.   Also, the #2 Democrat in this committee is a Black woman named Eleanor Holmes Norton. Normally she'd take over, but they decided to skip her in favor of yet another 70+ year old white guy (Lynch).   No, seriously. It's like a bad comedy.",Ut_Prosim,2025-04-28T13:47:57,5

"My expectations were on the floor and they chose the basement.  [This article](https://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2025/04/more-sad-tales-from-the-gerontocracy) says a source told them they're skipping Eleanor Holmes Norton, a black congresswoman, in favor of Stephen Lynch, a 70 year old white man.",darsynia,2025-04-28T13:08:04,16
"From what I can find, it’s a temporary assignment. Dem congressmen will then get to vote for a replacement",Incorrect1012,2025-04-28T14:10:24,7
">But Connolly is giving leadership duties to Stephen Lynch, the 3rd most senior D on the panel.  No, he has asked Lynch to take over temporarily until a new Dem ranking member is chosen. Lynch [wants the role](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/04/28/congress/stephen-lynch-house-oversight-ranking-member-00314482) and Connolly has said he’ll endorse him, but he has not been voted into it permanently.",UltravioletAfterglow,2025-04-28T18:52:45,1
