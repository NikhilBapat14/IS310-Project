"Tax credits and subsidies are used to help direct a specific outcome. If that outcome is less reliance on fossil fuels and less pollution then the credits are valid.   The fossil fuel industry really gets to me personally. Like, it is not a renewable resource. We will run out. Period. Something will need to take its place eventually and the most effective thing we currently have that makes sense is a BEV.  What we should be subsidizing is updates to our electrical grid, advancement in electric storage technology and EV charging infrastructure.   We need to save the fossil fuels we still have for use in things we can’t currently replace with alternatives.",JasonSTX,2025-04-23T18:30:51,72

"The market should decide the fate of both electric AND gasoline cars.  The problem is that gasoline cars are effectively subsidized by things like government tax deductions for intangible drilling costs and favorable depreciation schedules for oil and gas operations, as well as (depending on your car type or your location) some federal or state manipulations of things like gas taxes or other incentives. In short, the price of gasoline (and larger gasoline cars) is lower in the USA than it should be because gasoline is artificially made cheaper by government programs.  On a completely fair playing field, owners of gasoline cars would have to pay higher gasoline costs, which would likely cause many to swap out to more efficient “greener” cars… Which ironically would reduce or remove the need for EV subsidies in the first place.",foulpudding,2025-04-23T18:39:19,17

"It's OK for the government to nudge consumers in the right direction, but subsidies on EVs are misguided.  When the government is put in the position of picking the winning technology, they often guess wrong. Government handouts increase the surface area for political corruption and cronyism.  A better approach would be a steep carbon tax, rolled out gradually but inexorably, to give industries and consumers time to adapt. It could even be revenue-neutral (with everyone below a certain income level receiving a rebate every year).  The idea is to make emitting carbon more expensive and let the free market determine the best solutions. EVs would likely be the winning technology for passenger cars, but there would also be incentives for more efficient ICE engines, hydrogen fuel cells, or natural gas (for larger vehicles). These are just the technologies that already existed. Who knows what other tech was starved of funding that might have otherwise emerged?  A carbon tax has the added benefit of encouraging less driving overall, smaller vehicles, and increased use of public transit. EV subsidies encourage our existing car-centric lifestyles while making cars even heavier. The Hummer EV 9,700 pounds, which is around 3 Honda Accords.  When it comes to grid power, the favoritism shown to solar, wind and biofuels likely slowed progress on small-scale nuclear reactors and geothermal, for example. Biofuels were always stupid and only exist because of legal bribery by giant agricultural companies.",judge_mercer,2025-04-24T10:42:52,1

"I'll throw that back around with a competing question: is the current fate of gas vehicles something that has been decided by the markets?  America has subsidized the production of cheap and abundant fossil fuel for literally over a century.  Conservative estimates put U.S. direct subsidies to the fossil fuel industry at roughly $20 billion per year.  The latest International Monetary Fund (IMF) report instead estimates that the United States subsidized fossil fuels by $649 billion per year if we also include the negative externalities, which are basically costs that fossil fuel production places on society such as environmental cleanups.  Meanwhile, the total cost of EV tax credits is estimated at roughly $2B.  So at the bare minimum, EV cars are trying to break into a field where the federal government is actively subsidizing its competitor at a rate 10 tens higher than what EVs are getting.  And at worse, they are competing against the total *sum* of these subsidies that the federal government has given over the entire lifespan of the fossil fuel industry, including all of the things the government protects fossil fuel companies from paying.  And in that sense, throwing $2B at EV cars is a drop in the ocean compared to the tens of trillions that fossil fuels have received from the government.  So I question whether killing the program is truly ‘letting the market decide.’ It looks more like the government continuing to decide winners and losers, in an even more direct way than it currently is.",ManBearScientist,2025-04-25T13:55:57,1

"Electric vehicles work very well.  Lithium ion batteries as their source of power storage, not so much.  This is an example of government having a good goal but the wrong approach.  Electric vehicles have been with us since the late 19th century and their fundamental flaw -- dependency on batteries -- has not been adequately addressed.  An alternative is needed to the battery.  Relying upon heavy, bulky, costly storage that requires rare earth metals is at best a stop gap, not an answer.  The need for substantial subsidies is an indication that the markets can see the flaws, as sales would not require subsidies if the product was ready for prime time.  It would be worthwhile to invest heavily in finding that storage alternative.  A Manhattan Project for energy.  Sort that out, and you could have sustainable change.",I405CA,2025-04-23T18:53:52,1
"> Their assertion is that if EVs, as their proponents contend, are superior and cost-effective, they should be able to compete.  If the only cost associated with EVs vs ICE was simply the price tag of the item itself, this would be valid.  But that's not the point of the government subsidies or the reason why society as a whole should want to pivot towards EVs.  Nor does this address the fundamental entrenched position of ICE style engines possess due to existing infrastructure investments across the country.  It would be damn near impossible for EVs to ever win in an environment in which charging stations don't exist, where sheer engineering familiarity by car companies simply kept ICE engines cheap despite their not accounted for environmental impact (short and long term), where fuel is subsidized to a large degree that divorces it from reality.  Whether you give credits for EVs or start heavily taxing ICE engines for their pollution like you might cigarettes, at some point the government is going to put their thumb on the scale to help ""society"" and it's just a matter of picking which way is best.  As for the part about sourcing parts, etc.  Yeah, that's more problematic and it's one of those stupid elements to legislation that ends up over-complicating things.  The goal should just be to get to EVs.  Not mandating where the parts come from so much, or getting assembled here, etc.  All that does is drive up costs and require the subsidies to make EVs competitive.

"I think it’s perfectly reasonable for the government to subsidize particular industries to account for externalities that otherwise wouldn’t factor into price. There are a lot of negative externalities with internal combustion engine (ICE) cars, and so electric vehicles seem like an okay thing to subsidize. However, it turns out that a lot of the negative externalities of ICE cars also apply to electric cars: the death and dismemberment they cause, the particulate matter from brakes & tires, the costs to maintain roadways, the noise, the wildlife that is killed in collisions, etc. So in that sense, it seems a little ridiculous to subsidize electric vehicles but not e-bikes & robust public transit.  The one major advantage of EVs over ICE vehicles is that our foreign policy can care less about the price of oil. It would be great to not be worried about the threat of an oil embargo’s effect on oil prices.

In this case, as others have pointed out the oil and gas industries have been highly subsidized by tax payers for years under the premise that energy security is critical to our economy and security. This despite the fact that these forms of energy carry additional costs, externalities, due to things like air pollution and climate change.  EV tax credits are aimed at encouraging a pivot toward more sustainable transportation and energy storage and production. The economic argument is that the world is moving in the direction of sustainable energy and encouraging economic growth in this sector will position our economy to be more globally competitive as the world makes the transition.   You really miss the mark by suggesting that this is about a favored industry vs. tax payers. Ultimately this is obviously true, but it needs to be viewed more holistically.  I'd get behind elimination of 100% of corporate taxes incentives, mostly because this would help get money out of politics.

"That's true, and maybe I was understating things a bit.    However, there's more to the picture than emissions. EV battery manufacture is polluting to the local environment and very water intensive. Most EV batteries are thrown away at end of life.    Also, EVs are still cars and maintaining infrastructure for cars has a large impact. Concrete, for example, is hugely carbon intensive and we use a lot of it for car infrastructure. EVs are heavier than other cars and wear down roads and bridges faster.   I haven't seen a study that accounts for the infrastructure costs of EVs so I'd be curious to see if that blunts some of the emissions savings of EVs.   I still think EVs are better, but I also think we would be better off with fewer cars in general.",thoughtsome,2025-04-24T08:47:43,0
"This idea has gotten a lot of discussion in CCL circles and in meetings on the Hill. The rebates could be made progressive, but s[tudies show](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/household-impact-study/) that the monthly carbon cash back payments are enough to essentially cover increased costs of 85% of American households, including 95% of the least wealthy 60% of Americans. Those at the top levels of wealth will not fully recover their increased energy costs because they consume the most energy. So the policy does place a financial burden upon those who contribute the most emissions, while also relieving the most economically vulnerable households from bearing the burden for decarbonizing the economy.  One way to overcome public reluctance to accept new taxes is to start the carbon price low and then raise it over time. Similarly, an argument for equal payments to all households is to widen popular support from those at the top. This only works if it is politically ""sticky""--unlikely to be reversed down the road.",Fluffy-Load1810,2025-04-25T15:50:55,2

"Per the EPA source above:   >Myth #2: Electric vehicles are worse for the climate than gasoline cars because of battery manufacturing.   >FACT: The greenhouse gas emissions associated with an electric vehicle over its lifetime are typically lower than those from an average gasoline-powered vehicle, even when accounting for manufacturing.   >For example, researchers at Argonne National Laboratory estimated emissions for both a gasoline car and an EV with a 300-mile electric range. In their estimates, while GHG emissions from EV manufacturing and end-of-life are higher (shown in orange below), total GHGs for the EV are still lower than those for the gasoline car.",SuspiciousSubstance9,2025-04-25T01:38:43,1
">Also, EVs are still cars and maintaining infrastructure for cars has a large impact   The impact from driving tankers filled with gasoline everywhere outweighs the impact of evs by magnitudes.    Under the [Fourth Power Law](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_power_law), a 50% increase on millions of 2 axle vehicles is nothing compared to the thousands of tanker trucks. That's before considered how much further tanker trucks drive and how much fuel they guzzle doing it.  Edit: Quick maths.    Wiki example says that a truck is 15,000 more road wear than a car.   Google says that there are 300 million registered vehicles and 30,000 fuel tanker trucks. That's a magnitude difference of 10,000.   So the 10,000 more cars don't off-site the 15,000 times more stress a tanker applies.   But that's assuming they drive equal mileage. Average car is what, ~10k miles per year? Semi-truck is like 60k? A 6-1 ratio for quick maths.   So that's really 90,000 to 10,000.   Coming back to the 4th power law, if an EV is 50% heavier. 1.5^4 is 5.06. so the 10,000 becomes 50,000 or a 40,000 increase   Getting rid of fuel tanker is saving 90,000 but we're increasing 40,000? Just on fuel tankers alone.   Seems pretty straight forward to me. ",SuspiciousSubstance9,2025-04-25T01:52:23,1
"I bought a full sized Dodge Ram and used the hell out of it for its purpose of loading up crap in the bed that I couldn't otherwise haul. But it is parked most days in favor of a smaller, more fuel efficient car. I've had need for a truck intermittently for most of my adult life and I've owned a few in those decades. I don't think it had anything to do with Dodge telling me I needed it. If I was going to haul loads of soil, compost, mulch, etc. for landscaping it's kind of the only option. And I still use far less fuel driving that to work than others with way more fuel efficient vehicles because I chose to live 6 miles from work. At 14 mpg I use less than a gallon to drive to and from work in a day. But cars that get 35 mpg actually use more fuel daily for folks who live in other cities but work in my city. They often drive 45 miles each way for a total of 90 miles daily. At 35 mpg that's 2.57 miles per gallon, more than twice my usage in my inefficient truck and was less than my usage in my car which uses only half a gallon a day or less. But they'll still lecture me about getting rid of my truck ""for the environment"". At the level of driving I do in that truck these days it would take several dozen years to reach the environment impact of the manufacturing of a new vehicle versus just using this one until it can't be maintained anymore.",Appropriate_Ear6101,2025-04-30T01:08:49,1

"That's an interesting point that I had not considered, so thank you.  There is car-specific infrastructure (i.e. places where trucks don't go) that will be affected by the transition to EVs, but overall I think you're right about the positive impact of reducing fuel tanker trucks. Although I'll point out that 90,000 vs 40,000 is not ""magnitudes"" of difference.   The interesting thing about the fourth power law is considering the impact that transitioning to electric semi-trucks. Due to their heavy batteries, they won't weigh much more, but they'll carry less, so the savings from fewer tanker trucks may be offset by more shipping trucks due to electrification. I'll admit this is kind of a separate issue because of the need we have for trucks to move things around the country.  Still, I'm not anti-EV. I'm anti-car. Or at least I'm anti-more-cars-than-registered-drivers. I don't think subbing out gas cars for EVs 1:1 is going to be enough. That's my point although, as I said earlier, I may have overstated it.  Edit: Also, the wiki example is flawed in my opinion. It gives the weight of the tanker as 30 tons which is about right but it says that trucks have 3 axles. Trucks that heavy are usually 18 wheelers which have 5 axles. That reduces your 15,000 factor to about 1,300 and kind of ruins your whole argument. I think back of the envelope math isn't going to tell us much here.",thoughtsome,2025-04-25T08:29:56,1
