"And they have been going at it since Cooper was elected in 2017! Imagine if they put their time and energy into being a more desirable party instead of trying to bend the rules to their benefit.

"The republicans are grasping at threads in Virginia, it’s turning a nice shade of blue. It’s been blue in every national election for 20 years, all the senate seats in that time have been blue, and 4 of the last six governors have gone blue. The house is a mixed bag.
