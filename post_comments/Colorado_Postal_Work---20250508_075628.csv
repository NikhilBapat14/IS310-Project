"They wanted to ""test"" the system. No judge has ever heard that before. ""Sir I just wanted to test the security of the vault. It's good to go. You're welcome"".

Stupid assholes.",FkDemocRats2024,2025-05-08T09:22:09,63

If our elections are to be sacred then attempting to rig/defraud them should carry the heaviest punishments imaginable.,A_Hatless_Casual,2025-05-08T11:07:08,47
"Local reporting indicates that one was a registered republican and the other a registered independent.  Regardless of their affiliations or reasoning for the crime, better voting integrity laws are clearly needed to help ensure fair, valid elections in the future and not rely so much on human judgment of signatures, for example.",SpaceToaster,2025-05-08T13:53:41,29
