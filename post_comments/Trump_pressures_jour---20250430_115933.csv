"Two groups of people completely taling passed each other on the whole knuckle tattoo thing. First of all, it's completely irrelevant if it's a gang tattoo or not. Gang members still get due process. And we don't deport people based on gang status anyway.   As to the doctored part, that's also irrelevant. Maybe the tattoos he has are gang related or maybe not. The part that's doctored (adding the explanatory M S 1 3 above the marijuana, smiley, cross, skull) arent what people are claiming makes him a gang member. No one, Trump included, thinks his knuckles have the little M S 1 3 on them. They think the actual tattoos represent those things.   Trump isn't asking the guy to admit the doctored part is real. He's asking him to admit the real part it a gang tattoo. Again, maybe it is maybe it isn't. But people like OP are confusing the real (also irrelevant) issue with the fake (irrelevant) issue.

Well to say the truth can be contested is not reporting the facts. The photo is clear he doesn‚Äôt have it on his hand and the President contest this. But the evidence is clear.,Morepastor,2025-04-30T14:23:19,1
I just think he should have been more assertive. Someone need to tell Trump straight up that hes a fucking liar and keep at it until he admit he lied. But I get they were also on a time limit,Pormock,2025-04-30T13:56:42,1

"He doesn't usually keep up with his lies. He just *consistently* lies. He forgets what he said a few moments before. Doesn't matter. He'll lie about saying what he said anyway. He'll lie if **he watches a video of him lying**.   The dude a senile, cruel, compulsive liar. That's a difficult thing to relate to.",ErusTenebre,2025-04-30T14:08:22,14
"Even at that, Trump's lies are so prolific, I'd still wager he's told at *least* 4x as many lies as Biden, even if you count every marginally wrong statistic cited by Biden as a lie.  The problem you'd run into is that they'd refuse to accept when Trump is telling a lie as being a lie.  For example, ""Trump says immigrants eat dogs and cats"", they'd insist isn't a lie because immigrants 100% eat dogs and cats.  Where's the proof?  ""I don't need proof, *everyone* knows immigrants eat dogs and cats, don't be stupid.""",red286,2025-04-30T14:31:38,12

"I‚Äôm pretty sure he will never admit that, and so the reporter was probably walking that tightrope of trying to push him, but not so far that he starts whining about how unfair and mean this is and just walks out.

"So, the president of the United States has either been told by his aides that a manipulated photo is real, OR, they just showed him the photo assuming he‚Äôd be able to tell the ‚ÄúMS13‚Äù was annotating the existing tattoos. Here‚Äôs a journalist discovering on camera that the leader of the free world (as we used to style that office) can‚Äôt tell the difference, or is easily duped by aides. The story is huge with many ramifications. The guy is pushing his disinformation so hard that the journalist *could* take a beat and ask JUST ONE incisive question at this point, no? ‚ÄúMr. President, if you were to discover someone in our government doctored this photo and didn‚Äôt tell you, what would you do?‚Äù For example. Or ‚ÄúThe image was annotated, Mr. President - are you unable to tell the difference?‚Äù  Or ‚ÄúReminiscent of the hurricane map that was doctored, this is going to be a huge story if you don‚Äôt nip it in the bud. Can we get the photo out right now?‚Äù Or I don‚Äôt know - he‚Äôs the clever journalist, and he should have known that photo was going to be mentioned. He could have spun not just gold, but *useful* gold out of that moment. It was already being extended by the president himself - it would have taken a sharp or prepared journalist 5 additional seconds to clarify a further point. Granted, Trump did well on his own to expose himself. Lucky for Terry he didn‚Äôt fold as quickly as Terry begged him to, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs move on!
