"He actually says ""no one here is happy about it,"" which is the correct usage. In case the headline made anyone else twitch",ToNoMoCo,2025-04-28T12:01:40,88
"60 Minutes released on Bluesky yesterday the clip from the end of their show covering the subject of the article.  https://bsky.app/profile/60minutes.bsky.social/post/3lntjnd67es2u  It frankly and directly addresses CBS' parent company's (Paramount) hope for a merger that the Trump administration has approval power over, and how the editor who left felt that his editorial independence was being stifled.",SpaceElevatorMusic,2025-04-28T11:19:01,26
Last night’s episode of _The Rehearsal_ really did a nice job skewering Paramount+.,BeowulfShaeffer,2025-04-28T12:10:53,5
This is one of the dumbest storylines of this term.   He's angry over how a TV show edits. What an insane thing for the government to get involved in.,kanst,2025-04-28T11:44:22,7

Why? “None of us” is grammatically  correct.,bigskymind,2025-04-28T13:13:33,-5
There are dozens of us!,ToNoMoCo,2025-04-28T17:30:50,3
None of us is happy <  none of us are happy. And it’s just clunky.,PorQuePanckes,2025-04-28T13:17:21,11
“Is” should be “are” because “us” is plural,carto_phile,2025-04-28T14:22:10,5
"“None” can be used as singular (it’s a pronoun meaning “not one”)  so whilst it may sound clunky, it is still correct to say “none is”. But yes, the plural is probably more commonly accepted.",bigskymind,2025-04-28T15:54:40,2
"“None” is a pronoun meaning “not one” and therefore is singular but as mentioned above, the plural is more commonly used.",bigskymind,2025-04-28T15:51:13,2
It’s either depending on context. It can also mean “not any.”  [is none plural](https://www.latimes.com/socal/glendale-news-press/opinion/tn-gnp-0429-a-word-please-none-is-or-none-are-both-work-story.html),carto_phile,2025-04-28T16:19:40,4
