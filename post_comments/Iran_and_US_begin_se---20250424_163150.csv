Why would they even trust us? We had a great deal that they were following and this idiot already ripped it up.,Prayer_Warrior21,2025-04-24T17:09:24,2
"Right, just like US and China tariff negotiations are happening.   '""The past was alterable. The past never had been altered. Oceania was at war with Eastasia. Oceania had always been at war with Eastasia.""",loftbrd,2025-04-24T17:48:11,1
I feel like they had a nuclear plan and someone unilaterally ended it...Â ,HappyFunNorm,2025-04-24T18:04:55,1
"They don't, but they can't lose either way.   Firstly, every day they make the USA waste is a day gained where they can do whatever they are doing. Secondly, since the USA is now universally mistrusted (not just by Iran), any complaints that Iran is also negotiating in bad faith are not going to find any traction or sympathy.  This is actually a pattern with the current USA government, not limited to Iran. Everyone thinks they are a bunch of malicious idiots, who would dishonor any treaty at the drop of a hat. Everyone still ""negotiates"" with them because the USA is now structurally incompetent at it (in the sense that its domestic posturing does not allow it to be anything but dumb and short sighted) so it can be made to look weak even if the talks fail or whatever comes out of it is broken immediately. At the same time, like any country ever, the USA is forced to negotiate on some level because the alternative is to use force everywhere and on everyone, which severely limits what you can achieve and is ruinously expensive for little gain. Rather than unwilling to negotiate in good faith, the USA is *unable* to do so due to how its politics now work. This is a liability rather than a strength, for obvious reasons, and foreign actors will exploit that.  In short, they talk because the USA can be forced to talk and due to its political makeup is really, really bad at it. You might not get what you want, but you can make the USA look dishonest, belligerent or foolish regardless, and as a consequence chip away at its power and influence.",barryvm,2025-04-24T17:45:36,1
