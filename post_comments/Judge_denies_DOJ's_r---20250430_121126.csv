">In 2019, an immigration judge determined that Abrego Garcia was removable from the U.S. based on allegations of his gang affiliation made by local police in Maryland. But Abrego Garcia was subsequently granted withholding of removal to his home country.  The basis for those allegations were:  * Garcia was wearing Chicago Bulls merchandise, * An unnamed information said he was a member of a part of MS-13 which is based in a state Garcia has never lived in, and * the cop who filed that report was later fired and convicted for misconduct",kandoras,2025-04-30T14:43:32,135

Advocating for a more punitive use of the current system in response to the quickly rising threats of fascists, who will literally purposefully bog down the system while they plan to overtake it, is not extrajudicial.

Most people are not afforded such courtesies when they cannot afford good counsel. The law allows for quicker processing, which is used frequently with most citizens, and for blatant disrespect of the court to be punished.

"Then bring him back and deport him legally. They sent him away to El Salvador illegally and if you care so much about the law so much you know that’s wrong. If as you so assume he’s done so much that he should be deported again (this time legally to a non el Salvadorian country), they’ll do that with proper authorization from the courts because that’s how due process works. You can’t pretend you care about the laws he broke while not caring about the laws the government broke? If he’s supposed to be deported then he is but not illegally (which again you pretend you care about so???). You should be advocating for the proper processes to be done right if you care about it as much as you pretend to. You should want him back for the actual law to handle it not the government deciding for the judicial branch. The highest court in the nation has said we should bring him back. Any “well idk he deserves to be there” after that is not a serious legal argument and you HAVE to know that it’s not actually about the law to you if you have a problem after that.   This is like me saying well a robber should go to jail for robbery but we indicted him on a murder charge falsely but since he should be in jail anyway that whoopsie daisy is just fine. Totally wrong circumstances (and wrong crime). You’d hopefully say he should be charged for the robbery and not a murder he didn’t commit right? If yes, the same idea should apply here. Or are your morals actually fake and only apply when you want them to? You “only want to uphold laws when it’s convenient” too by your own words. You don’t want to let the people actually involved in the legal profession do their own jobs.  And plot twist: sorry to say the biggest flaw in your argument is that guess what? the law doesn’t not work for people who have committed crimes. Are you for real my guy? Imagine if you sold someone drugs and I decided you didn’t need a trial and I just gave them life in prison or something by myself because you deserve prison time anyway and I happen to not like you so I get to decide that? You think because someone committed a crime they don’t get legal process? **COURTS ARE FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE COMMITTED OR ALLEGEDLY COMMITTED CRIMES AND THEIR VICTIMS IF THERE ARE ANY. IT DOESN’T MATTER IF YOU’RE A “BAD GUY” THAT’S LITERALLY WHAT A COURT AND THEREFORE AS AN EXTENSION THE LAW IS THERE FOR????** Why do you think the judicial branch was even formed? Why do you think we have so many laws as it pertains to courts? WHY DO YOU THINK LAWYERS EXIST?????? What would even be the point in a court if “well he did a bad thing so who cares what happens”? Why would we even have trials or juries or due process or literally anything???? What is going on in your brain, genuinely? Is it anything at all????  It’s not even about morality policing you (though you seem content to do so to other pretending to use the law as the excuse) but that you’re so unbelievably lacking in any and all critical thinking at all by saying “I care about the law and doing things legally” and then essentially saying you don’t believe in the literal foundations of the legal system????
