"India struck terror targets. Unfortunately, in Pakistan, from Osama bin Laden on down, Islamic terrorists have have ties to the Pakistani Islamic terrorist regime. And Islamic terrorists have long since learned to play the victimhood game.  I agree with all of this including the title of this post.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-05-07T08:35:27,203
"Glad someone posted this, and I damn well agree.  Pakistan has played with fire for years supporting terror groups. Now they got what they've been asking for after their cronies decided that attack killing civilians was a great idea.  I don't think I need to remind anyone here where Ben Laden was found hiding....  Or where the Taliban were being supplied from. (Or indeed which country was cheering when they were winning the war).  I hope India kicks their ass if Pakistan even thinks of responding.  Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.",SlightWerewolf4428,2025-05-07T11:42:36,88
"The Middle East needs to learn that it can't house terrorists and then act surprised when they're terrorists. Not just Pakistan; Lebanon, Yemen, and even Mexico. Either get them out or accept strikes on your territory.",Scamandrius,2025-05-07T10:15:21,144
"Is this the 4th or 5th war between them? Unless it becomes nuclear or directly threatens American interests, I don't think anyone will care.",HonoraryNwb,2025-05-07T08:56:52,56
"Here we go again. Looks like another Indo-Pakistani war is brewing. As long as they don't threaten to nuke each other, we should not involve ourselves in it. Also, we should really rethink our relationship with Pakistan. After all, we should not have ties with a country that supports terrorists.",Pugnatum_Forte,2025-05-07T17:53:56,12

"The problem is that anyone who could get them out flees, leaving only the ones who sympathize/agree with the terrorists.",Panzershrekt,2025-05-07T11:28:24,24
"I most certainly don’t because It’s identical to Israel vs Hamas. Genocidal Muslims target a peaceful population, and fire first. Peaceful population returns fire, genocidal Muslims play victim card.   It’s the same old story, same old song, same old dance, and a tale as old as time.",Ok-Willow-4232,2025-05-07T09:39:56,145
"Post independence…1965 and 1971 wars, Kargil in 1999, the 2019 skirmishes following the Pulwama attack, and then this recent skirmish following Pahalgam—yep, that’s five.",AplabTheSamurai,2025-05-07T12:40:22,11
"The real concern here is that the nuclear armed Pakistani military is infiltrated by terrorist groups. If the conflict escalates to the point of increased nuclear posture on the Pakistani side, the risk of said nuclear weapons falling into the hands of anti-western terrorists during transport increases dramatically. There’s definitely reasons to care.",dingyksubis,2025-05-08T01:01:30,2
Appreciate this clean assessment! But wait a few days and you will see leftists spin it the same way they did Israel/Hamas.,ShanayStark7,2025-05-07T15:26:24,20
"One thing makes this more worrisome to me.  From what I understand, Pakistan is not doing great in terms of both water and general stability.  I don't like the idea of truly desperate people - or politicians exploiting that desperation - fighting a war.    But yeah, it's is mostly just more of the same.",NotAnotherRedditAcc2,2025-05-07T11:17:30,12
Here’s a grandiose idea: **STOP PERSECUTING YOUR RELATIVELY DEVELOPED NEIGHBOR AND MAYBE THEY MIGHT HELP YOU!**  The Pakistanis are fucking idiots.,Ok-Willow-4232,2025-05-07T11:20:06,68
