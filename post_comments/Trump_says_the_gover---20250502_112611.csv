"The President of the United States is targeting private organizations who do not bend the knee personally to him.  And many ""Americans"" seem fine with this behavior.

"[quoting from this article:](https://nonprofitlawblog.com/president-trump-meet-internal-revenue-code-section-7217/)  “Section 7217(a) of the Internal Revenue Code provides:  It shall be unlawful for any applicable person to request, directly or indirectly, any officer or employee of the Internal Revenue Service to conduct or terminate an audit or other investigation of any particular taxpayer with respect to the tax liability of such taxpayer.  An “applicable person” specifically includes the President,  the Vice President, any employee of the executive office of the President, and any employee of the executive office of the Vice President. IRC §7217(e)(1). It also includes a number of other high level officials (other than the Attorney General).  Violation of Section 7217 is a criminal offense:  Any person who willfully violates subsection (a) or fails to report under subsection (b) shall be punished upon conviction by a fine in any amount not exceeding $5,000, or imprisonment of not more than 5 years, or both, together with the costs of prosecution. – IRC §7217(d)   The statutory intent behind Section 7217 can be found in its title: Prohibition on Executive Branch Influence over Taxpayer Audits and Investigations. Congress recognized the danger of weaponizing the IRS for politically-motivated retaliatory investigations and actions, just like the ones being contemplated by the current administration.”",beadzy,2025-05-02T21:02:57,2
