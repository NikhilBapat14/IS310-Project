"For the future of America, it's actually important that enough MAGA voters get absolutely gutted by his policies and that enough Red States become the poverty hell holes many deserve.  Their stupidity when believing Trump's lies needs to be smashed by bankruptcies and unemployment cues.",Virtual-Squirrel-725,2025-05-06T03:43:28,25
"Oklahoma voted 66-32 for trump, so probably 2/3 of these struggling people voted for him, so those people can enjoy the results of their vote.  Annoying how the article completely steers clear of asking anybody about their politics or if they thought things would be different under Harris. A huge missed opportunity for relevant information and context.    Sorry, but America is at the stage where people with huge life problems who want us to sympathize with their situation need to tell us how they voted first.",ElPlywood,2025-05-06T06:51:25,17

Maybe cover a state and a bunch of voters that didn't self-inflict? Is the food so good at small town diners that the Times only covers their stories? Or is it the lot lizards?,parrot1500,2025-05-06T06:45:35,3
"They should look at FLGS/board games/war gaming industries, it's getting really bad.  I even had a store owner (Warhammer) tell me he tells everyone to just print the chaff now a days and is shifting his focus to a community space more than product sales",FlyingRock,2025-05-06T00:11:11,2

"Yup. I am utterly out of fucks to give for entire regions. Sorry if you're a progressive living in one of those areas but you have to pick your battles when it's totalitarian. OK looks lost for at least a whole generation, in many ways.",shoobe01,2025-05-06T18:11:11,2
"Their voting shouldn't be relevant. Why does someone in rural Oklahoma, desperate for any opportunities, getting barraged by right-wing media saying Trump will make things better vote that way. Because they are too focused on surviving day to day to question it. If one cannot empathize with them, cannot talk to them to shift their perspective or provide the information that they need then of course they are going to vote for Trump. They feel and largely have been abandoned by politicians so are the perfect targets for charlatans. Empathy and being willing to talk from their perspective is the key to starting to shift people away from Trump. Otherwise if you don't they will stay there and even gain supporters as people identify with the group being demeaned. Genuinely how radical right-wing movements tend to gain traction and support is the feel of marginalization and the way to break them up is indeed Empathy and discussion showing them the otherside isn't evil just human.",cjh42,2025-05-06T07:27:03,-9
Eh. One was super conservative and the other thought trump would help the working class. No fucks from me for morons,Commercial-Co,2025-05-06T03:22:23,25
Thanks for this. It's an excellent article that I hope folks will read instead of just posting replies off the headline.,BryteInsight,2025-05-06T02:00:22,9

"Nah. Their lives are ruled by hate, and everything they don't like is fake news. Empathy ended after they voted trump the third time, knowing exactly who he was and not caring because of who he hated aligned with who they hated.",lodren,2025-05-06T08:05:08,13
Because they were to stupid to know better. They get 0 fucks given. Reap what they voted for.,Springtimefist78,2025-05-06T08:04:29,8
"Here's the thing: they HAVEN'T been abandoned by politicians. If that were true, things couldn't get abruptly worse with a new administration. Their unwillingness (or inability) to recognize that doesn't make the opposite true.  How well they've been taken care of is arguable, of course. Lacking beats crazytown by a mile, though, as most Americans are finding out.",barneyrubbble,2025-05-06T08:49:00,3

"They are only forgotten because they keep voting for people who don't give a shit about them, its that simple.",Short-Ring-9705,2025-05-06T08:35:55,7
"The problem with that view that you have is it pushes people toward the conservatives and Trump. Not saying you have to like these people. But haven't empathy, being able to talk to these people from a perspective they can understand is important to turning them toward your side to moving people across the aisle. These are desperate people in a very low income area who are focused largely on day to day survival. Them getting very little news and being told Trump will change things make America rich that is a message desperate people on a sinking ship will latch onto. Talking to people is the key. The black man who manages to get hundreds of KKK to leave the clan did so by simply talking, empathizing with people who would normally hate him, sometimes that is what it takes to shift people. Calling them morons, ignoring the economic realities that they face, that pushes people away to continue with Trump as the other side is belittling them. Again the grifters and wealthy patrons around Trump they know what they do and cannot really be reasoned with direct your hate there as they also provide the disinformation that is manipulating the poor and desperate in this country to go against their own interests.",cjh42,2025-05-06T07:19:30,-8

"Statistically, 2/3 of these struggling people did vote for trump, and those people voted for sustaining and/or worsening of economic policies that hurt them.  Partisan low information voters don't deserve my sympathy, at all.",ElPlywood,2025-05-06T07:05:45,10
Sorry you’re stuck in a state with people who just gave up on learning once they hit the 5th grade.,Equivalent-Simple647,2025-05-06T07:03:10,7
"That is the thinking that keeps them hating. That prevents reproachment. Ignoring everything about them. If you read the article most of them didn't seem hateful just people barely surviving day to day and not really able to care about politics. But keep calling them hateful morons and they will continue voting republican, voting for hate rather than talking to them, acknowledging that they have problems, they are people and you are people that is how hate is broken. You are ruled by a hate for them to them you are also worthless. You are a reflection on the less evil side sure but still one who is part of the problems that have lead to such societal division that is so easily exploited by charlatans like Trump.",cjh42,2025-05-06T08:10:16,-9

"So 2/3 of Americans across the board voted him in, Is that what you're saying?",PressureOld2375,2025-05-06T12:04:26,-2
"So what do you do? You try to tell them the truth and you’re fake or a liar or a communist. You try to improve their lives and you’re a socialist.  If these people are too short sighted to see that the people they vote for do not improve their lives how do you show them? Many democrats spent a lot of time and money campaigning to try to bring republican voters across the aisle, and it’s always failed. Some people will just vote against their own interests forever because they don’t even understand their own interests.",Kaizen2468,2025-05-06T10:11:36,5

"You talk to them to their interests. Sanders whether you agree with him or not has done very well even in these areas as he talks with people to their problems. Some people are indeed too stubborn, hateful, or ignorant to reach. But a lot of people who voted Trump are the victims of right wing media campaigns compounded by the general fact that the average Americans lives have gotten worse and the messaging they get is that the existing political class has stolen from them ergo the preference for perceived outsiders like trump. Is it smart no but again people who are barely surviving day to day don't have the time to get informed ergo why talking to them, empathizing with them, being able to get messages through to them is important. This is a war that the democrats are losing they  may have campaigned to bring Republicans across the aisle but only at high level and not really communicating at the grass roots. This is something that has to be worked constantly not just during an election season and why democrats have lost and continue to be completely pushed out of red states as the national establishment basically gave up on local parties so they don't get the resources to do basic outreach.",cjh42,2025-05-06T10:18:43,-2
