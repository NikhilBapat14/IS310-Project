Columbus wasn't American. He never even stepped foot in this country.  Maybe Trump should also add Putin Day to the calendar.,gradientz,2025-04-27T15:16:16,45

"The regime is in a death spiral and so Trump is reaching for the ""white grievance"" playbook again. This is a signal to keep his dwindling base rabidly aligned.   The playbooks are failing in 2.0 so everyone just needs to keep calling out their failures.   Stuff like this and the regime's Aunt Lydia telling women to submit to their christian husbands is all part of making sure the red hats don't snap their leashes.   Don't buy it. Look at the pattern of desperation in these stories. They are losing and they are rolling out all the stops to stem the bleeding.",KaliMau,2025-04-27T15:30:00,14

"Columbus is one of those things where Trump and the SJW’s are both engaging in zero-sum “I can only win if you lose” thinking.   Columbus’s voyage was, unequivocally, a pivotal moment in world history. In European history. In American history. Putting the voyage in a historical context, it marks one of the most significant turning points in human history.   That’s worth knowing about, that’s worth remembering. It’s worth understanding how we got here. Where it began. What followed after.   It’s also worth knowing about the European guns, germs, and steel that followed. That decimated and, in many cases, completely wiped out indigenous American civilizations. It’s worth learning about those civilizations, their cultures, and their contributions to history.   Both things are true.   Remembering that voyage and the temerity and seamanship it took to make it is ok.   Remembering that Europeans discovering the Americas proved tragic for the people already living there, and that humanity lost entire civilizations in the decades and centuries that followed is also ok.   Both things should be happening. Both things should be in the history books.   Saying that all that matters is Columbus, those three ships, and his crew is not the full picture.   Nor is it the full picture to say that Columbus, those three ships, and his crew are the ones responsible for everything that followed. The Spanish, the Portuguese, the French, the Dutch, the British, and all of those monarchies, chased fortunes and each other. The Church chased converts. Many decisions were made following the discovery of the new world. All of that history is worth knowing learning about as well.   I digress, but it isn’t zero sum. You learn about the entirety of the history. You learn about the voyage of Colombus, you learn about the indigenous American civilizations and cultures. We shouldn’t be seeking to learn about one and not the other.   And back to the politics of it… the reason trump identifies things like this to attack is because it’s the same zero sum purity testing nonsense that he wants to engage in. It’s the nourishment for his politics. Given that, I especially hate to see this particular issue pop up in the news.",-Gramsci-,2025-04-27T16:42:43,2

"I have a great relationship with the Italians. Lots and lots of Italian friends. Many from New York. Many from other places. I want it to be like the old days when people would say “Happy Columbus Day.” Not as big of a day like Christmas or our lovely Fourth of July, but pretty close. Almost up there, right?  Have you noticed that Columbus doesn’t get talked about like he did in the old days? He’s fallen out of favor, if you can believe it thanks to the radical left sickos who hate our country and were doing things to it like nobody’s ever seen. Nasty people. And big strong guys, tough cookies who may not have cried since they were little babies pleaded with me. And even when they were babies they may not have cried. And they were actually crying, “sir! Please save our precious Columbus Day!” I think it met more to them than anything in the world. Some were Italian, others were, something else, a little better perhaps. But we’re doing things to make sure that the craziness ends right here and right now. And they say Columbus was a bad guy. He was a substantial guy, one of the greats. One of the greatest American heroes. It’s true. And he sailed to the new world in three big boats. Real beauties. Remember their names? The Nina. Nina! Then you have the Pinta. The Pinta. What a great name, don’t you think? Pinta! Then you have the biggest of them all. The whole ballgame. The Santa Maria. Santa Maria. That’s the one he was on because I don’t think he was on that one and the other two at the same time, right? They don’t make them like that anymore, that I can tell you. He discovered our country. And the Indians greeted him and his associates very warmly when they came to the shores of what is now our very great, strong country. They did it with love. Such a love fest, when he came here. Full of love. And gave him corn and lots of other things. Back in those days they called corn “maize.” What a name, “maize”. I like “corn” instead but that’s ok. That’s ok. And they wanted him there to bring the holy word of the big guy. Not me, but the other big guy, much bigger than me, actually. God. That’s who Columbus was here for. He was here in the name of the king of kings. And they made big, beautiful statues of Columbus all across our great country but, the mobs of woke radical left Marxists and fascists pulled them down and said we can’t honor him. What a disgrace. Sad. These people. But we will honor him again and we will do it very strongly, much stronger than ever before, believe me, much stronger.",SilverBison4025,2025-04-27T15:38:14,1
