"The Fed is unlikely to cut rates. Trump's tariffs are creating inflationary pressure at the same time that they are shrinking the economy. In such a stagflationary environment (as experienced during the Carter Administration), the Fed has historically chosen to tackle inflation first and let the economy take the hit to growth.  With how quickly consumer confidence is collapsing, a small, largely intangible to the average consumer act like a rate cut will absolutely not improve the situation, or help the administration's political woes when the dominant conversation in politics is Signalgate and the upcoming Republican budget.",22Arkantos,2025-05-02T03:12:46,97
Cutting rates during a time when the Bond market is weakening would cause a big uptick in inflation. The Fed Reserve won't willfully do that because it would be devastating for the economy.,8to24,2025-05-02T06:27:32,27
"Mid 2025 doesn't ""coincide with the buildup to the U.S. presidential election "", that would be more like 2027 or 2028.  In the meantime, the Fed is unlikely to cut rates until they see firm evidence that inflation is under control and Trump's tariffs are going to cause massive inflation according to most economists.  The most likely response to Trump's disastrous handling of the economy will be the Democrats taking over the House in 2026.  GDP shrank in the first quarter, so we are teetering on recession even now, and probably are in one now. Trump can try to blame Biden but that isn't going to work for very long. There is no way Trump can spin it so people don't notice the economy crashing.",billpalto,2025-05-02T07:41:33,12

"If the fed were to cut rates, it implies that Trump managed to replace the fed chairman with someone that will do as Trump likes. This will immediately undermine confidence in the US Dollar monetary system. The bond market will collapse, forcing bond rates to skyrocket (possibly even then not finding buyers). This means the US’s source of credit drys up (which is what pays for most of what the government does right now). It wouldn’t take long for economic collapse to follow. Think 2008 (the underlying details will differ, but the result will be the same). This would be economically and politically disastrous.

"Post-pandemic inflation had already cooled by the second half of Biden’s term (faster than the rest of the world too). Unemployment at all time lows, stock market at all time highs. And we only just started cutting rates. The US had the best economic outlook going into 2025 that we’ve seen in a long, long time.  Tariffs changed all that. They raised taxes on everything we buy (the largest peacetime tax hike in US history). They are highly inflationary. Forget cutting rates for the foreseeable future. We need to be in full damage control to prevent hyperinflation at this point.",hryipcdxeoyqufcc,2025-05-03T14:38:41,2
"> Some economists now predict that rate cuts could begin in early to mid-2025.  > If that happens, it would coincide with the buildup to the U.S. presidential election  are your dates wrong? because this makes literally no sense. early 2025 is already over. it's the past. rates weren't cut. mid is possible but certainly not expected, but either way  literally NONE of this coincides with the 2028 election buildup.  interesting that such a odd statement comes from an account with no real activity and a presumably automatically generated name. is OP just shilling his own YT account?",reaper527,2025-05-02T10:42:18,2
"I mean, sure. It would have significant political repercussions.  It wouldn't be a good idea right now though and would be spectacularly idiotic if it were to happen over the next few passes. If anything, *raising* rates might curb the potential stagflation that generally comes with tariffs. Not fix, not solve, just delay and hope for policy changes.  Otherwise it is Reagan era and rates will need to rise an order of magnitude to correct the fuckery.",NorthernerWuwu,2025-05-02T06:19:04,1
"The fed will cut rates when it is appropriate to do so.  The fed is an independent entity removed from government control and as a consequence of that freedom they (Board of Directors and FOMC) are allowed the latitude to make the correct decisions regarding monetary policy to achieve positive outcomes in terms of GDP growth, low unemployment and stable prices.  They make these decisions on the basis of data, not based off of the direction of political wind blowing.",Dull_Conversation669,2025-05-02T07:05:27,1

"If the tariff war continues, then there will be no rate cuts.  The tariffs will bring stagflation and the Fed's focus will be on addressing the ""flation"" part of the problem.  If the tariff war ends, then the Fed may cut rates.  But markets are still skittish in response to Trump's erratic chaotic behavior.  The markets will want to feel comfortable that Bessent and Powell are not going to leave.  If the Democrats were in the White House, the economy would be in decent shape and a rate cut would have almost surely been in the cards this year.  The damage we are having now is strictly due to one person's failure, which should tell us that we need to address this lack of real-world checks and balances.",I405CA,2025-05-02T09:25:22,1

"While I generally agree, we’re in an unprecedented time of political law where anything could happen. Trump is routinely doing things like ignoring 9-0 SCOTUS losses and just claiming he won, arresting judges he doesn’t like, and deporting (more accurately, “remitting”) US citizen child cancer patients.   Given that his lawyers successfully argued in court that he could legally have anybody murdered and that he’s virtually immune from prosecution, it doesn’t seem improbable for Powell to be arrested under false pretenses for “harming the economy” or something similar and for people to continue being arrested until they comply as with Nixon’s Saturday Night Massacre, but more severe.   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Massacre",Rastiln,2025-05-02T05:53:26,27

"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1II24  Too early to tell.  The CPI actually decreased slightly in March.  The interest rate will likely go down some as we are no longer experiencing the 2022 surge in inflation and it has only been somewhat elevated in the last few years.    https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1II3b  There is plenty of room to drop the rate given that we went from 0.08% interest in 2022 to 5.33% by 2023 to combat an unprecedented surge in inflation.  It won’t go back down to 0.08% anytime soon, but it will be significantly lower to combat any inflationary effects from an increase in tariffs.  We are well ahead of it at least, so now is a good time to mess with tariffs on the back end of a massive inflationary spike we just suffered through.  Doubtful this round of inflation will has anywhere near the effect as several trillion in excessive federal spending hitting the market all at once.",Fargason,2025-05-02T06:50:09,-8

Anything the fed does that doesn’t bend a knee to emperor ovaltine will be considered hostile and political by the regime and state media.    I don’t see how cutting or not cutting rates doesn’t end up impacting the “election”.  Either way the fed ends up being a political scape goat.  It’s the instability of an unstable rogue president causing the damage and the fed isn’t designed to fix an unstable and completely stupid president.  At this point we are likely to see the end of the fed and there will nothing left to guard against the actions of this rogue president.  Fundamentally we need the power to tariff to be stripped from the president and most of the things he does with executive orders to be temporary unless approved by congress.  There needs to be some kind of control in place to limit the damage and instability caused by this asshole.,JDogg126,2025-05-02T06:23:04,20

"Much different type of inflation as tariffs don’t mess with the money supply unlike printing several trillion dollar to then drop it on the market in a short period of time.  Tariffs aren’t really considered inflationary as it is just a few adjustments to prices while standard inflation is a compounding problem that is continually rising prices.  Much more control over tariffs too as you cannot take back excessive government spending after it hits the market.  Not to mention the problem of it being hard to stop excessive spending once you start as we are still far from preCOVID spending levels half a decade later now.  Plus a global market can be quite resilient, so double the price in China doesn’t mean it will be that way in the rest of the world.  Other suppliers will move in to fill a lot of the gaps.  China’s cheap goods weren’t really cheap anyways as they enacted a high longterm price far beyond today’s dollars.",Fargason,2025-05-03T13:28:47,-1

"Consumers don't care about ""types"" of inflation. They only care that things are more expensive or completely unavailable. I do like how you're pretending like the massive disruption to the supply chain into the US is completely dissimilar to the inflation during COVID which was not caused by the stimuli as you (and many other conservatives) claim, but by the global supply disruption.

"Consumers, and especially voters, do care a lot about the type of inflation we just suffered through that brought down the value of the dollar by 20% in just a couple years.  Vastly different than a linear price hike from tariffs that can often be mitigated by a resilient global market.    I like how you are pretending the 2021 “transitory” inflation explanation from the Biden administration was actually true.  Overwhelmingly the case was excessive government spending as shown here in MIT research:  https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/federal-spending-was-responsible-2022-spike-inflation-research-shows  Federal spending was a 41.6% factor to the inflation surge while the supply chain was a 10.1% factor rolled up with all other producer pricing issues.  No other inflationary factor even surpassed the teens percentile.  We don’t have supply chain issues for half a decade either.  Inflation is still elevated well above the historical average because federal spending is still elevated.  This is mainly due to the Biden administration’s infamous “Spend Big” policies as seen here in their very first budget:  >President Biden on Friday unveiled an historically large $6 trillion 2022 budget, making his case to Congress that **now is the time for America to spend big.** > >Mr. Biden's proposed budget for fiscal year 2022 surpasses former President Trump's proposed budget last year of $4.8 trillion, and comes after trillions the U.S. has already spent to battle the dual health and economic crises brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.  > >Budget projections show a $6 trillion price tag is **just the beginning**, with spending steadily increasing each year until the budget reaches $8.2 trillion in 2031.  https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-budget-6-trillion-proposal-2022/",Fargason,2025-05-03T18:58:26,-2

Also, I love how you conveniently ignore that the first two big stimulus packages were done by Trump, not Biden, so if your theory of the past inflation is true, Trump's responsible for creating it and Biden is responsible for getting it down to more manageable levels.  Regardless of how the last round of inflation started, the upcoming stagflation we're going to experience soon has a clear, sole cause: Trump.",22Arkantos,2025-05-04T11:54:09,2

"That is inferior research from an admittedly “simple model” that doesn’t really quantify the factors of inflation.  It is also self published where as The Determinants of Inflation used very complex models based on several decades of data and published in the JOIM.  The MIT research even covers inflation expectations as the second largest factor at 16.9%, but that is still nowhere close to excessive government spending at a 41.6% factor.  I like how you conveniently ignore how Democrats control the House during COVID and took advantage of the crisis to drastically increase spending.  Like when Senate Republicans proposed a $650 billion relief package and House Democrats countered with actually passing a $3.4 trillion plan.  Clearly the driver of excessive government spending was Democrats and not Republicans.  >“Since that time, my members will attest, the needs have only grown since May 15, four months ago,” Pelosi said, **referring to the day Democrats passed their own sprawling $3.4 trillion package**. “The needs for the small businesses, for the restaurants, for transportation and the rest.” > >And **Senate Republicans have shown no appetite for moving beyond the $650 billion relief package they tried to push through the Senate last week**, which was rejected by Democrats as woefully inadequate to meet the health care and economic crises facing the United States.  https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/17/coronavirus-stimulus-deal-417142  > Who are you to judge a quality source as inferior?
