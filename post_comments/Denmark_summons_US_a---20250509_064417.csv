Good for Denmark.    This administration thinks they can be disrespectful to everyone.  It is shameful.,Smithy2232,2025-05-09T06:47:17,174
Time for Denmark to welcome a NATO arctic defense training exercise on Greenland soil.   Get them landed before trump tries anything stupid. They can't roll in after.  NATO is a defensive alliance.     Time to start defending.  ,sometimes_rite,2025-05-09T06:51:51,91

Trump wants Greenland. The spying is to suss out the attitudes/reactions to being annexed and the mineral resources. See https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0eley5gy8wo,Intrepid-Ad603,2025-05-09T10:14:20,21
They are probing for angles to start outrages with being a part of 'Rigsfællesskabet'. Maybe not spying but trying break the Unity Denmark and Greenland have.,deuzorn,2025-05-09T10:17:16,11
The stupidest part is that if Trump had been diplomatic about it we (Denmark) would have given him all the military bases and intel he could ever want. What we can’t do and won’t do is give up territory and now he’s just being a whiny little bitch about everything.,wynnduffyisking,2025-05-09T13:00:10,7

And America is threatening to attack a NATO member. Also being a NATO member doesn’t suddenly mean that’s fine and not worth a show of force.,pasher5620,2025-05-09T17:09:58,5

"That's one of the many parts of this that I hate. We (US) already have military bases in Greenland. Denmark and therefore Greenland were our allies (and still are to the sane people here). If they want to mine rare earth materials, that's their decision and would still be a good thing for the US. There's no reason to want aggression against our own allies nowadays, it's just inventing a problem and making the entire world worse.",Duke_Jorgas,2025-05-09T13:44:12,1

I’m certain a big part of this is that Trump is still pissy about our PM saying during his first term that the proposition to buy Greenland was absurd. I think that really pissed him off and because he’s a fucking toddler he has never let it go. Add to that some weird delusional wish to be a president who expands American territory because he sees himself as a great statesman. And then we have this ridiculous situation on our hands.,wynnduffyisking,2025-05-09T14:17:55,3
