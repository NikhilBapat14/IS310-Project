"Bondi commented on Judge Joel Cano and his wife's arrest in New Mexico.  The couple is accused of harboring an illegal immigrant suspected of being a member of the Tren de Aragua street gang in their home.  Cano is facing obstruction charges, Bondi explained. “He took one of the TdA members’ cell phones himself, took it, beat it with a hammer, destroyed it, and then walked the pieces to a city dumpster to dispose of it to protect him.”  His wife is also facing charges for destroying evidence, the attorney general said.  Shame on you Cano and his wife and shame on the Wisconsin judge as well!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-25T19:01:05,15
