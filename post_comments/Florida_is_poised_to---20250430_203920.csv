"I don’t have an opinion either way about fluoride in the water. However, I will say that almost everything has sugar added to it now. Also, I see parents allowing kids to have massive amounts of candy, daily.   The sugar is the problem. Js.",StonieTimelord,2025-05-01T04:15:28,0
"There’s too many factors to conclude anything on that. The tests may have been different, the population that made the IQ tests could be different. Some Americans don’t drink tap water so it’s only a subpopulation that becomes affected by flouride etc.  Or perhaps the IQ of Americans would naturally be higher than the Danes if it wasn’t for flouride. I don’t know. But both Denmark and the US acknowledge that flouride hurts the intelligence of children.",ILiveInAMango,2025-05-01T05:35:11,-2
"Fluoride in water is a form of mass medication without informed consent, which most of Europe has rejected on ethical grounds. In fact, 98% of Western Europe drinks non-fluoridated water, with countries like Belgium explicitly stating that delivering medicinal treatments through drinking water is not the responsibility of water providers.   https://fluoridealert.org/content/europe-statements/  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_fluoridation_by_country  Moreover, the primary benefit of fluoride is topical, not systemic—its effectiveness comes from direct contact with teeth, not ingestion.  https://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/opinions_layman/fluoridation/fr/l-3/5.htm  https://fluoridealert.org/studies/caries04/  Drinking fluoridated water does not replicate this mechanism; you don’t drink water through your teeth. Instead, systemic exposure introduces risks such as neurotoxicity and thyroid dysfunction. If fluoride is so critical, why not advocate for targeted topical applications rather than forcing everyone to ingest it?",Mooseclock,2025-05-01T07:01:47,-5
"[The Relationship between Fluoride Exposure and Cognitive Outcomes from Gestation to Adulthood—A Systematic Review - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9819484/)  Even a broken clock is right twice a day.  Edit: To all the downvoters, here's the lawsuit and court decision that addresses most of your points:  [Specifically, the Court finds that fluoridation of water at 0.7 milligrams per liter (“mg/L”) – the level presently considered “optimal” in the United States – poses an unreasonable risk of reduced IQ in children.](https://www.cand.uscourts.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/17-cv-2162-Food-_-Water-Watch-Inc.-et-al.-v.-EPA-et-al-Opinion.pdf)",chockedup,2025-04-30T20:53:17,-24

"A Danish study found that fluoride in water above 0,3 mg/L(which is way under the international limit of 1,5 mg/L) has shown to affect children’s intelligence negatively.

Children exposed to flouride in the womb has significantly lower IQ than if they weren’t exposed. In Denmark we actually try to avoid drilling for water in places where the levels are only half of what they are in the US.  Perhaps the rise in IQ will lead to a rise in brushing your teeth properly.,ILiveInAMango,2025-05-01T05:12:24,-10
"This is my issue with the whole thing. We’re basing fluoride opinions on one study that (apparently) hasn’t been replicated and relies on a notoriously subjective measurement like IQ that ignores all the environmental toxins and factors that person has lived through up to the point of the IQ test. We know the very real health benefits of fluoride, and only have a possible negative that isn’t really convincingly proven, but even if it were doesn’t seem to be a super bad negative (a drop on a point or two of said IQ).  I’m no expert and am fully willing to be proven wrong, I don’t have my heart in this either way, but I’m definitely skeptical of changing policies based on that evidence and promoted by an administration notorious for not doing good science.",ennuiinmotion,2025-05-01T05:41:02,5

"> The overall evidence from this systematic review suggests that **exposure to fluoride at a level of more than 2 mg/L in drinking water may result in impaired cognitive outcomes among children**. However, the inclusion of many low quality studies and the lack of robust estimates of fluoride exposure from all sources make it difficult to provide definitive conclusions.  The conclusion of that very study.  > [In Florida, utility providers add enough fluoride to bring levels to 0.7 parts per million — **or about three drops in a 55-gallon barrel of water.**](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2025/04/29/florida-moves-closer-to-banning-fluoride-from-drinking-water/#:~:text=In%20Florida%2C%20utility%20providers%20add,August%20spoke%20against%20the%20practice.)  In other words, the fluoridation levels are WELL BELOW the results of the study you linked.",Sinfire_Titan,2025-04-30T21:04:47,12
"The dose makes the poison.  Also note that most municipalities should target at most 0.7mg/L however much of rural America consumes well water, which does not have controlled levels of fluoride.  Removing fluoride from municipal water supplies won't do anything but increase oral hygiene issues.   Well water users very well may be suffering from fluoride effects because their water is not regulated the same and often has fluoride levels well beyond the recommended amount.",mattgen88,2025-04-30T21:01:59,5

"""As a Dane"" you probably don't fully grasp how sugar laden the diet of the US's poor is. ""As a Dane"" you might also not understand that dental care is not subsidized in the US.
