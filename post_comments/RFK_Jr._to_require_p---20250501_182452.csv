Does he not know that all trials already do that?,backpackwayne,2025-05-01T18:26:12,89
"Well, so much for seasonal influenza vaccination.  One of the main reasons we vaccinate healthy younger people is to avoid transmitting influenza (and other viruses) to older and more vulnerable people. It's weird how fixated republicans seem seem to be on killing off their own voters.",_grandfather_trout_,2025-05-01T18:27:23,28
"It’s not super clear from how this is being reported, but yes new vaccines have placebo controlled trials. What RFK is doing here is trying to require them for updates to approved vaccines.  Basically this is a way of killing annual flu and COVID shots.",CanvasFanatic,2025-05-01T18:51:27,16
"> He also claimed that ""except for the COVID vaccine, none of the vaccines on the CDC's childhood recommended schedule was tested against an inert placebo, meaning we know very little about the actual risk profiles of these products.""  This is such a dumb fucking thing to say. We know *a lot* about the actual risk profiles of these products, considering that they've been used for decades.   And yes, obviously there are people who have adverse reactions to vaccines. And we know that. But the reason that they've been so successful is that the benefits far outweight the risks. The biggest risk being a huge number of people dying from a fucking preventable disease.",mediocre_remnants,2025-05-01T18:45:21,13
"Lol, like this isn't already in every trial. Does RFK not understand how basic research is conducted?  JFC, this man is an idiot and he's in charge of our nation's health...Continued dark times ahead for America",Snorki_Cocktoasten,2025-05-01T18:28:50,12
So let people get sick intentionally?  We no longer do that because it’s medically unethical. No doctor can legally participate in such studies.,No_Contribution8150,2025-05-01T19:31:10,5
"Wow, he effectively banned new vaccines",SnootSnootBasilisk,2025-05-01T18:33:09,6
I see insurance companies sueig as this will force them to have to pay more as everyone gets a lot sicker,coatofforearm,2025-05-01T19:00:21,3

This is it. Seasonal vaccines have been functionally banned. ,Soggyglump,2025-05-01T20:03:23,1
Can someone explain to me why congress's past gave the executive the authority to do this? Dems under Biden should have spent their time ripping power from the executive to prevent Trump.,TimothyMimeslayer,2025-05-01T19:08:28,1
"There are a lot of things that RFK is doing that I do not agree with. For the most part, this is not one of them.",Hungry_Complaint_945,2025-05-01T18:26:41,-23
No he’s an idiot,now_error_later,2025-05-01T18:27:33,52
This is about requiring placebo controlled trials for yearly updates to approved vaccines.  Basically he’s trying to kill annual flu and COVID vaccinations.,CanvasFanatic,2025-05-01T18:49:53,33
"They do and they don’t do that. Both the flu and Covid vaccines originally went through controlled trials. This is about the annual variants. Every spring/summer, scientists look at which strains are emerging/on the upswing, and use that to tailor the manufacturing over the summer so you can get a shot in the fall and be protected from those strains in the winter. What he wants is some proof that this year’s vaccine is effective before it is approved for manufacturing. But if we wait long enough to see that, then it will be too late make sufficient quantities, vaccinate, and protect people. We’ll be protecting them against last year’s variant.",unspecifiedbehavior,2025-05-01T19:23:17,14
He wants covid 2.0 so he can send checks out with his name on them to yolo into crypto and stocks while we are jobless with 5k while billionaires become trillionaires.,oroechimaru,2025-05-01T19:47:26,6

They don't plan on holding anymore elections so they don't need the elderly for their votes anymore,SnootSnootBasilisk,2025-05-01T18:32:09,11
"They don't want to pay for anyone's healthcare. If you're too sick or disabled to work then you're not worth keeping alive. So many people, even liberals, parrot the ""if you don't work 40+ hours a week, then you don't deserve healthcare."" Healthcare doesn't have to be a scarce resource, but as long healthcare systems, insurance companies, and pharmaceutical companies prioritize funding the high level executives' third vacation homes, we're all going to suffer.   Plus, all of the republicans in power have access to expedient and quality healthcare. They are all vaccinated, at least for the ""big"" things like the TDAP and MMR. They aren't anti-vax, they're anti funding vaccine programs. Considering Trump's advanced age, I'm guessing he gets the influenza and COVID vax yearly. Only nutjobs like RFK actually think vaccines are harmful and I'm sure even he has had some.",mycatisawhore,2025-05-01T19:17:10,3
"When you're older than dirt, look like a sunburned anus, and survive on a diet of Lard, Unpasteurized Milk, and undercooked ground beef, you're not exactly planning long term.",aradraugfea,2025-05-01T22:40:05,1
Covid vaccine didn't,pickledplumber,2025-05-01T22:15:44,1
This is such a sociopathic idea. Giving an inert placebo to one group means many of them will  *die*. It’s completely unethical to set up a test like this.,downhereforyoursoul,2025-05-01T20:58:56,6
"It's in bad faith. The ""studies"" are intended to cast even more doubt on vaccines and eventually eliminate them or make them cost prohibitive (for all but the rich).",earthfever,2025-05-02T01:49:13,1
"They don’t, why do people think deadly illnesses use placebos in their trials?",No_Contribution8150,2025-05-01T19:35:53,0
"Insurance companies simply won't pay. They'll come up with some legal, yet ethically reprehensible reason to deny coverage.",mycatisawhore,2025-05-01T19:26:56,2
"Congress simply can't do all the things needed to run the country vote by vote, so they passed laws that created agencies to do the mundane day to day stuff for them. They gave instructions on how those agencies are to be run, and then delegated Congressional authority to the agency. Congress can take that authority back any time they want to. They don't want to.  The agencies are under the executive branch because the agencies job is to carry out the laws of Congress, which is an executive function.",-Random_Lurker-,2025-05-01T19:26:05,1
There's a very good reason why improved vaccines are tested against the current vaccine and not a placebo.  Mainly the fact that you don't want people dying of the disease because they were injected with saline.,-Poliwrath-,2025-05-01T18:29:38,24
"Are you willing to share your credentials that enable you to make such an statement that sounds informed?  Perhaps you are a clinical trial immunologist or a medical ethicist.

Do share.",srandrews,2025-05-01T18:32:34,11

"Since you are both qualified medical ethicists, are you willing to explain why in some cases it is immoral to use a placebo in a clinical trial?",srandrews,2025-05-01T18:47:23,-18
"Flu vaccines are exempt because there's 80 years of data on it. This is for new vaccines ""experimental"" vaccines or vaccines for new viruses and strains.    It's also to test the efficacy of boosters. Boosters more than anything should go against a placebo group considering boosters are being administered when the population has already been exposed to said virus and have already built up a level of immunity to it. ",EdderMoney,2025-05-02T05:32:40,1
Nobody cares what their stupid “plan”…that’s not happening.  If you think people are going to just accept it you’re crazy.,No_Contribution8150,2025-05-01T19:34:55,2
"Yes, it did. I literally know a person who was in a placebo group.  They know they were in the placebo group because once the vaccine effectiveness became apparent they requested to be find out which group they were in to know if they still needed it be vaccinated.",CanvasFanatic,2025-05-01T22:44:48,2

So the executive is a de facto and de jure king as long as the legislature doesn't care?,TimothyMimeslayer,2025-05-01T19:43:15,1
You may have broke it.,nerphurp,2025-05-01T18:47:08,1
"All studies are double blind, meaning both the doctor and the patient are in the dark about who got the medication and who didn't until the study is over; however, in some trials like the new HIV prevention medication trials, there was no placebo- they only included new vs old (already successful) medication in the study... Which is far less risky for participants. These sorts of studies would go out the window if RFK Jr gets his way.",Chimerain,2025-05-01T19:44:09,20

Human history has taught me the large majority of humans will go along with a dictatorship as long as they're not the target of discrimination. Why do you think dictatorships last so long?,SnootSnootBasilisk,2025-05-01T20:24:12,3
"No. The agency is given a scope of responsibility, and guidelines for how to fill that scope. That's written into the law passed by Congress. If the exceeds the authority given to it, it's actions can be overturned in court. The authority granted is not unlimited. The Judicial and Legislative both have the authority to reign it in.  The problem we're having now is that the executive is exceed it's authority without regard for the law to begin with and ignoring the courts. Congress \*should\* respond by revoking that authority and bringing the executive back into line. It's choosing not to, because this is what Republicans want.  The real problem is that the Justice Department is part of the executive for some reason, so a corrupt executive can capture multiple branches worth of authority without having to control that third branch. It doesn't matter what the courts say if no one backs it up. If we get out of this mess, making the Justice Department a completely independent branch will be essential.",-Random_Lurker-,2025-05-01T19:49:23,1
The bot or the human who is likely inferior to a bot?   Yeah. I asked that way because that is what social media content filtering should be doing to verify that a voice deserves to be heard.,srandrews,2025-05-01T18:49:33,1
"Yup, sometimes a placebo is unnecessary.",srandrews,2025-05-01T21:36:06,4
I'm not sure how that informs the fact that the commenters above think placebos are already used in studies. Sometimes they are not used. And RFK Jr is an idiot too.,srandrews,2025-05-01T21:37:57,1

Cheers to the open mindedness.   I cut my reply off after digging through its comment history; but.... it's good a reminder of the times I've gotten it wrong.,nerphurp,2025-05-01T18:59:07,1
