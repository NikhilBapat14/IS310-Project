"Correct. While it seems self evident it appears many people never understood that corporations don’t see or even recognize boarders, economic philosophies or government loyalties. They exist for profit and profit only. Everything else including all mentioned above are just realities that have to be dealt with. The idea that a corporation is American or for America or is American strong is ludicrous. Those are just marketing strategies used to increase profits.  If China were to take over the U.S. and Ford or GM saw this as an opportunity they would be running Ads showing a pickup truck traversing the Great Wall with the national anthem of China playing in the background.",Apprehensive_Ad_4359,2025-05-05T11:52:48,1

The problem with this idea is that businesses are so inept and waste money all the time. This makes it seem like they are always in the know of what is a good idea and their choices are just robotic in the nature of greed when in reality personal opinions absolutely weigh in here.   Is Costco going out of business because it sells hotdogs at a loss?  There is an element of cowardice in these decisions. It may not be the biggest factor but it’s certainly there.,DrQuantum,2025-05-05T12:33:18,9

"> There is an element of cowardice in these decisions.  No there isn't. It's 2 options. One makes them money while the other makes them more money. If anything... it's risk which is not cowardice.   >“I came to (Jim Sinegal) once and I said, ‘Jim, we can’t sell this hot dog for a buck fifty. We are losing our rear ends.’ And he said,   >***‘If you raise the fucking hot dog, I will kill you. Figure it out.’***   >That’s all I really needed. By the way, if you raised (the price) to $1.75, it would not be that big of a deal. People would still buy (it). But it’s the mindset that when you think of Costco, you think of the $1.50 hot dog (and soda).  >“What we figured out we could do is build our own hot dog-manufacturing plant (in Los Angeles) and make our own Kirkland Signature hot dogs. Now we are doing so much hot dog business that we’ve opened up another plant in Chicago.  >“***By having the discipline*** to say, ‘You are not going to be able to raise your price. You have to figure it out,’ we took it over and started manufacturing our hot dogs. We keep it at $1.50 and make enough money to get a fair return.”",tech57,2025-05-05T12:55:57,-2

"It is risk I agree and your interpretation of the risk is different than mine. We probably won’t agree on that but what we likely can agree on is that companies are wrong enough in their risk calculations that we shouldn’t always extrapolate greed as the motivator of every decision as if they would never make decisions that lower their profit. They do, and they do often.   The problem with how this is being phrased is it makes companies look like giant robotic monoliths that crunch numbers perfectly. And yet, somehow everyone who works for one of these companies sees the truth of these decisions. That they are often wholly predicated on bad data, false premises, and certainly have nothing to do with short or long term profit. The elite capitulating to fascism, especially one created through foreign interference is one of the dumbest things they could possibly do for short and long term profit.",DrQuantum,2025-05-05T13:13:15,3

"Here's the thing, there is no interpretation because there is no cowardice. It's rich people who like to make money...   >The elite capitulating to fascism, especially one created through foreign interference is one of the dumbest things they could possibly do for short and long term profit.  It's not dumb. It's capitalism.   >The prevalence of the corporation in America has led men of this generation to act, at times, as if the privilege of doing business in corporate form were inherent in the citizen, and has led them to accept the evils attendant upon the free and unrestricted use of the corporate mechanism as if these evils were the inescapable price of civilized life, and, hence to be borne with resignation.  >Throughout the greater part of our history, a different view prevailed.  >Although the value of this instrumentality in commerce and industry was fully recognized, incorporation for business was commonly denied long after it had been freely granted for religious, educational, and charitable purposes.  >It was denied because of fear. Fear of encroachment upon the liberties and opportunities of the individual. Fear of the subjection of labor to capital. Fear of monopoly. Fear that the absorption of capital by corporations, and their perpetual life, might bring evils similar to those which attended mortmain [immortality]. There was a sense of some insidious menace inherent in large aggregations of capital, particularly when held by corporations.  >Blast from the past, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, 1933 dissent in Liggett v. Lee  You want to see long term profit? You want to see bravery?    China Just Turned Off U.S. Supplies Of Minerals Critical For Defense & Cleantech   https://cleantechnica.com/2025/04/05/china-just-turned-off-u-s-supplies-of-minerals-critical-for-defense-cleantech/   > What China did wasn’t a ban, at least not in name. They called it export licensing. Sounds like something a trade lawyer might actually be excited about. But make no mistake: this was a surgical strike. They didn’t need to say no. They just needed to say “maybe later” to the right set of paperwork. These licenses give Beijing control over not just where these materials go, but how fast they go, in what quantity, and to which politically convenient customers. >  > The U.S.? Let’s just say Washington should get comfortable waiting behind the rope line. The licenses have to be applied for and the end use including country of final destination must be clearly spelled out. Licenses for end uses in the U.S. are unlikely to be approved. What’s astonishing is how predictable this all was. China has spent decades building its dominance over these supply chains, while the U.S. was busy outsourcing, divesting, and cheerfully ignoring every report that said, “Hey, maybe 90% dependence on a single country we keep starting trade wars with and rattling sabers at is a bad idea.” >  > Try ramping up your semiconductor fab or solar plant when your indium source just dried up. It’s a fun exercise in learning which of your suppliers used to be dependent on Beijing but never mentioned it in the quarterly call. >  > The materials China just restricted aren’t random. They’re chosen with the precision of someone who’s read U.S. product spec sheets and defense procurement orders. Start with dysprosium. If your electric motor needs to function at high temperatures—and they all do—then mostly it is using neodymium magnets doped with dysprosium. No dysprosium, no thermal stability. No thermal stability, no functioning motor in your F-35 or your Mustang Mach-E. China controls essentially the entire supply of dysprosium, and no, there is no magical mine in Wyoming or Quebec waiting in the wings. If dysprosium doesn’t come out of China, it doesn’t come out at all. It’s the spinal cord of electrification, and right now China’s holding the vertebrae. >  > So here we are. China has responded to Trump’s tariffs by cutting off U.S. supply of some of the most essential ingredients of the modern world.",tech57,2025-05-05T13:30:23,-2
