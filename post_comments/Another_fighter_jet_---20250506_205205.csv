Good thing we got rid of all the DEI and trans members from the military. They kept too many of the planes on the flight deck. It was too cluttered.,Internal_Swing_2743,2025-05-06T21:12:57,40
"From Perplexity..  The two most recent losses-the F/A-18E on April 28 and the F/A-18F on May 6–7-are the only publicly reported instances of fighter jets literally sliding or falling off the deck of a U.S. aircraft carrier in modern operations. No earlier cases of a Super Hornet or similar carrier-based fighter aircraft going overboard during routine handling, launch or recovery have been documented in the U.S. Navy’s recent history, making these events **unprecedented in the last several decades of carrier aviation**.",HunterDude54,2025-05-06T21:10:11,29

"Too often.   The arresting cables take a hell of a beating.  They are inspected regularly and replaced as needed but they sometimes still snap.  The arresting engines (giant spools of wire with brakes) under the deck sometimes malfunction too.  And then there is pilot error, and landing signal officer error… and, and, and.    So this ship has been in hot combat for a while.  They just got a new skipper.  They’ve had a few incidents.  Like a sports team down on their luck they are making mistakes.   But landing incidents happen.  I don’t know that this would be classified as a mistake.  It sounds like they followed protocol. My sense is they landed, hooked a wire, it payed out as usual and killed their speed but broke before it could bring them to a stop.  They were going too fast for the brakes to keep them on the deck, and too slow to resume flying.  Protocol is to eject before the plane hits the water, which is what they apparently did.",guttanzer,2025-05-07T04:48:08,6
"Planes missing the arresting wire -- well, wires (there are up to four on the Truman), is rare but not unheard of.

"I just learned that Hegseth extended the Truman's tour twice.  This is definitely SecDef malpractice.  That ship needs to come home to be refurbished, and the front-line crew re-assigned to their next career stages.  IMHO, both accidents were directly related to 27th inning loss of focus in the crew and beyond-end-of-life in key equipment.  No amount of gung-ho pep talking is going to fix those two root causes.  The Truman needs to come home and be replaced on station with a ship fresh from its shakedown tours.  That's why we have 11 carriers.  At any one time 1/3 should be in port undergoing modernization/refurbishment, 1/3 should be on shake-down tours to figure out how to operate the new equipment and take advantage of the new capabilities, and 1/3 should be on station executing flawlessly.  Hegseth never did tours of the Pentagon where people pick up this common DOD wisdom.  He's winging it.  Watching superhero movies and getting poufed for Fox appearances is not a substitute for actually knowing how to make these decisions.  Trump's decision to hire him was also an extremely bad one, but it seems par for the reality show host.  Hegseth is putting people at risk and has to go.",guttanzer,2025-05-07T10:38:55,3
I bet. I bet the pilots and the crew of the Truman practice these landings more than we could both ever imagine.,YuppiesEverywhere,2025-05-07T10:46:19,3
"Any pilot worth their salt gets to fly a plane. Any pilot worth their own and their teams salt is a Navy pilot.  Carrier landings are a fundamental action for our military. This is like fucking up a 4 mile run for a track star. Everyone in the world is looking at our military and recoiling ""how did that incompetentce happen?""  Even one failed landing emboldens our enemies in a way that comes from the Intel sector, ie with high value.  My understanding is the same as everyone else's. It's a hard maneuver, but the Americans are the last ones who would fuck it up, it's trivial for them.",Appropriate_Unit3474,2025-05-08T01:43:10,1
