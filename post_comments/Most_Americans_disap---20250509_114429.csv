"Yeah, like we know the majority of America isnâ€™t MAGA and doesnâ€™t approve of or support Trump and his policies, but they failed to all show up at the polls for the election, so it doesnâ€™t really matter.  He probably doesnâ€™t care all that much. He is serving his 2nd term and doesnâ€™t need to campaign to be elected again. All that he is worried about is enriching himself, benefiting the rich to gain favors from people that he wants to owe him, entrenching his power and influence, wielding power to extort people into getting what he wants, and making sure he doesnâ€™t face any legal threat to his personal being.  So now weâ€™re stuck disapproving while the minority rules the country for 4 years because they actually did show up.",jster1311,2025-05-09T14:21:56,3
