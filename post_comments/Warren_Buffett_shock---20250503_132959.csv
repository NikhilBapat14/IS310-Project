He's closing in on 100. It can't possibly be all that shocking.,Batbuckleyourpants,2025-05-03T14:06:45,60
"Warren Buffett is probably one of the smartest men to have ever lived. He may not have been a scientist, a doctor, an inventor, but his investment knowledge and wisdom has changed the world and impacted millions of lives for the better. If you haven't, you should really read or listen to some of his writings, they are both simple, and insightful.  I always thought he would be like his pal Charlie Munger and stay there until he died. But it's smart that he lay the groundwork now for Berkshire's succession while he still can. Godspeed Mr. Buffett.",MetallicaRules5,2025-05-03T14:20:28,45

"His right hand man and longtime business partner Charlie Munger died while still holding his position at BH. Many, myself included, thought Buffett would probably do the same. So yeah, it's a bit shocking. Probably the right decision, but still shocking.",MetallicaRules5,2025-05-03T14:23:21,18
"Hes very sharp too. During one of his shareholder meetings, the question was asked about his age and retirement. The question was worded like ""Will you step down when you get old because older people can make more mistakes."" This was when Charlie was still alive.  Warren says ""You let us know when that starts happening."" I've owned BRK/B for a long time and its consistently been my best performing investment.",OliverMonster1,2025-05-03T15:16:16,18
