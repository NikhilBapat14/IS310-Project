"What happens is a 10% rise in childhood cavities.  Doesn't sound like much, but they are much more likely to require anesthesia.  A lot.     Who would want their kids to go under anesthesia if they could avoid it?  I guess these people trust anesthetics.",insuproble,2025-04-29T14:56:29,43

The amount of fluoride in the water is very minuscule.  0.7 ppm.  But who’s to say what’s best?,Scrumpilump2000,2025-04-29T14:58:05,0
"While pretty much everyone in this administration are idiots of the highest order, are we sure this will have a negative impact? I'm not saying arbitrarily do it, but there should at least be a study about it. 50 years ago made sense caused a drop in tooth decay, but how people have taken care of themselves has improved dramatically over the last 50 years as well. Have there been any recent studies on the impact of removing fluoride from the water systems?",ianrl337,2025-04-29T15:02:37,-9
"Jesus Christ, absolute echo chamber here. Most of the world does not put fluoride in water. It’s an industrial byproduct — lobbying led to its general inclusion in the American water supply. Studies showing a concomitant reduction in cavities are flawed. Brush your teeth w a fluoride toothpaste and you’ll be fine.   This is a good thing, executed by bad people.",bounceswer,2025-04-30T14:25:35,-5
"A few weeks ago, I had a former acquaintance on social media curse me out for making a joke about Dentists loving this as an easy trick to make tons of money when Utah did this.   He then proceeded to tell me to, ""read the words of people much marter than yourself,"" and posted 4 easy to find studies and meta analysis from Google onto my post and ended with, ""how's this smart guy?""   Naturally, if you read them all, they all confirmed the age old adage: ""the dose makes the poison."" I pointed that out to him and he swiftly blocked me.   Trust me, Republicans/Conservatives can Google, they just can't read effectively. And if they can, they cherrypick.

"Due to choices my county made without any input. We have no fluoride in our water and haven't in a few years. I bought prescription strength fluoride toothpaste from my daughter's dentist to make sure we keep her teeth as healthy as possible.   In no way, shape, or form, do I want to give her anesthesia unless absolutely necessary and using fluoride cuts down on that chance.",mamaquest,2025-04-29T18:54:20,6
