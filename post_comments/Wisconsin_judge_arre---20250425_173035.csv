"These charges are so stupid.  There was an ICE agent \*\*in the elevator\*\* with the defendant after he left the courtroom.  But oh yeah, the state judge somehow obstructed ICE because she let the defendant leave the courtroom through a side entrance.        The Trump DOJ is run by morons and thugs. But remember, a clown with a flamethrower is still a clown.",DraganTaveley,2025-04-25T17:47:16,24
"The judge was about to hear a case against a Venezuelan man and whether he should be arrested and charged or have his case dismissed. In the middle of the hearing ICE comes in demanding he be handed over. The judge says, “Let me get the facts straight and let me notify the superior judge about this matter.” As the judge talks to the ICE she notices the clear implication and desire of the agents is to prevent her ability to provide judicial review under habeas corpus and after having a conversation with her superior and the agents awaiting with the intent of arresting a person who has not been convicted or charged. She tells the lawyer and the accused to leave the court room through the back as she has supreme authority within her court room. The agents notice that the man and his attorney have left and go chase after them without due process and without the correct warrant needed and approved by the judge. The judge in question then gets arrested and now being charged for obstruction when she has supreme authority within her court room and by how our legal system works.   The person being accused is innocent until proven guilty and the ICE agents even with a warrant cannot break judicial procedures and arrest a man not found guilty and detain him without trial. This is as far a breach of law and the separation of powers as ever happened in the USA. If a judge is arrested for being against an illegal act by the executive branch within the court house. That’s game over. Either we have separation of powers or we don’t. Either we have a constitutional obligation to protect all persons within the nation from tyranny and illegal arrest without due process or we don’t.",latin220,2025-04-25T17:49:03,31

She has that right. It’s her courtroom and she decides who’s going to be in there or not. She decided who’s guilty and who is not. Not ICE. They wanted to arrest the man even if he’s found not guilty. That’s illegal. They didn’t even have a warrant which was approved by the judge or her superior and by that alone they had to not interfere within the court system. So many laws violated within a few minutes that it’s jarring. If a judge is not the supreme authority within the court house then why have separation of powers between the judiciary and the executive branch? If the executive branch deems you guilty they can detain and arrest any person without due process? That’s what they’re arguing as part of her arrest of “obstruction of justice.”,latin220,2025-04-25T17:57:26,17

"This is a dumb take.  She is a  county judge, these are federal authorities. She has no more authority to impede federal warrants being executed than your local beat  cop has in hindering a FBI criminal investigation.

"That is not the same thing as a warrant for arrest. A warrant for arrest is a *judicial* warrant, where you bring evidence to a judge and they sign off on the arrest.  An administrative warrant *does not* empower you to enter private areas or make arrests. It is effectively just an internal memo from ICE. It is not reviewed or signed off on by a judge.",HerbaciousTea,2025-04-25T19:00:54,16

"Has to be approved by the judge. A warrant cannot interfere with court proceedings and the judge realized intent and the likelihood that the warrant was frivolous as in without verification it’s hearsay. Especially with how ICE is acting. A judge has the right of supreme authority within her courthouse. You don’t interfere with court decisions or assessment of guilt. She didn’t even get a chance to rule on the matter. If you assume he’s guilty then you already failed civics 101. All people are innocent until proven guilty before the court before we can say, “He assaulted.” That’s grossly unfair and biased of you.",latin220,2025-04-25T18:11:53,14

"The judge is simply enforcing the separation of powers. Even if she’s a diehard Republican or Democrat or whatever. She was obeying the Constitution. In a courtroom she has absolute authority. A judge has to render a decision and then a review of punishment can be done. Assuming guilt before sentencing and judicial review is insane. Saying, “I have an administrative warrant. I can interfere in the court proceedings!” Is lunacy! Even if the superior court agrees that the warrant is legal and decides with the facts presented by ICE. There are several steps before detainment, arrest and conviction, not to mention expulsion of a detained immigrant. Even if the person was here illegally they have a right to ask for an appeal and submit their application to be become a citizen. A misdemeanor is what illegal entry or staying within the USA beyond a reasonable expectation. Not a crime worthy of imprisonment and deportation without review. So many laws being broken 😞",latin220,2025-04-25T18:18:09,5

"Until we have the facts and a rendered report from the courts and one which proves guilt without a reasonable doubt then it’s hearsay. A judge must assess the facts and render judgment. That’s how our system works. The president and the executive branch cannot act as judge, jury and executioner because it deems it has that right under the alien sedition act. Especially without a declaration of war or without extreme circumstances. We are not in a world war. We are not being invaded. A judge has the supreme authority within the courthouse and ICE by arresting the judge for “obstruction of justice” is like arresting umpire in baseball for calling a strike you didn’t agree with and then arresting him for obstruction of baseball.

"Not without due process. Trump’s acting like a dictator. He may have entered the country illegally, but thats a misdemeanor not a crime worthy of violating court procedures and deny habeas corpus.

Again, you want to remove people? Start with violent offenders who have been convicted. Don’t go after people going about their lives! The immigrants have a right to be here because we are a nation of immigrants and people have the right to appeal their case and transition from an undocumented status to a legal permanent resident through our immigration system. You don’t stop people while in a court case to preempt them from their proceedings and to deny them the opportunity to appeal their case.
