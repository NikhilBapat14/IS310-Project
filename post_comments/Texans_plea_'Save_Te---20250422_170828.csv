Musk's thinking he'll return to Tesla and step down from DOGE. Think that will resurrect the stock price? Sales?   I think not.,Chemical_Result_6880,2025-04-22T17:15:05,18
"They misprinted the banner. It should read ""Fuck Tesla Fire the Nazi"".",TV_Tray,2025-04-22T17:59:40,10
"Doesn't matter. He'd still own it.  EDIT: part of it apparently. Still doesn't matter to me, personally. Maybe it'll teach future corporations to be a little more careful not to pick people like that to be the CEO.",barryvm,2025-04-22T17:19:05,12
At this point I’m not sure if they’ll be able to recover their image. There’s going to be massive distrust of any company closely linked to Musk at this point. He made a fool of everyone and himself and people are pissed now.,TheOneWhoIsTryin,2025-04-22T17:52:27,6
Here in rural Texas the amount of teslas I see has absolutely exploded after the election. Which isn't surprising.  The only thing rural Texans don't like about nazis is the name.,SouthAlexander,2025-04-22T17:55:45,5
"""if Musk leaves the White House, there will be permanent brand damage, but Tesla will have its most important asset and strategic thinker back as full-time CEO""  Most important asset? What? Who is this Ives dumbass. Musk is toxic, especially for Tesla. I sure as hell will never buy one.",roboscott3000,2025-04-22T18:45:04,5
"Fuck Tesla and Musk,They destroyed the Tasla name,they watched him and let him do it.",Great_Ad4198,2025-04-22T18:13:02,4
best i can do is fuck em both,hurdurBoop,2025-04-22T18:22:17,3
"They need to reject musk or Tesla is done, wrong way dude.   Musk is not strategic, he is impulsive and reactive in the most toxic way.",Silly-Scene6524,2025-04-22T19:41:50,3
teslas have BEEN overrated. they’re overpriced and gimmicky. $99 for a monthly subscription for “full self driving (supervised)” are you deadass? let this fucking company die and send elon on a one way trip to mars.,spookypups,2025-04-22T20:24:08,3
"...and force him to divest, or Tesla's done. ",StrangerFew2424,2025-04-22T18:02:10,2
"Tesla is not Elon Musk. Tesla has a board, and investors that have co-signed Musk and are ok enriching themselves at the expense of average Americans. People should not fall for the “Musk is leaving politics”, “Tesla will fire Musk” rhetoric. The whole organization should disappear.",1882024,2025-04-23T10:10:05,1
Not really. The board of shareholders would fire him.,MeatPrestigious3597,2025-04-22T17:50:24,1
He has 13% of the stock. He does not own Tesla. The stock holders do.....,Harry_Mud,2025-04-22T17:50:00,-1
"Unless Musk resigns & sells his shares, Tesla will never recover... ",StrangerFew2424,2025-04-22T18:04:06,4
More reasons I fled Texas last year.,PhoenixTineldyer,2025-04-23T08:41:32,3
Musk is by far the largest shareholder... he basically owns Tesla. The board can fire him but he'll still be an owner. ,StrangerFew2424,2025-04-22T18:03:36,3
"I’m not even sure that will. People now hate Muskrat. He was THE face of Tesla. You take that away and you’ve got over priced EV that aren’t as good as competitors, have a shitty design (Trucks), and the baggage of people boycotting the company because they hated the guy who made it.",TheOneWhoIsTryin,2025-04-22T19:47:12,4
Nope. at only 13% he does not OWN it. The shareholders own the company.,Harry_Mud,2025-04-22T18:08:01,1
Of which he's by far the largest shareholder... aka owner. The only way someone else could own more than him is if they were able to somehow buy up over 13% of the stock... ,StrangerFew2424,2025-04-22T18:16:28,3
AKA bullshit. He's not the owner. The shareholders are. He may own the largest single amount of stock but he does not own 50.1% of the stock...That would make him the owner. He only has 13% which does not make him the owner.,Harry_Mud,2025-04-22T18:19:06,-2
"Until there is a hostile takeover & someone is able to buy more stock then him, he is the largest controlling interest. Sure, technically, no one ever owns a corporation even if they own over 50%. But in the real world, he owns the company.",StrangerFew2424,2025-04-22T18:22:57,4
No actually if someone owns over 50% of a stock they do in fact own and control the company.,Traditional_Entry627,2025-04-22T19:23:49,-3
"A corporation is legally considered a separate entity. No one technically ever owns a corporation. They just control it. What you're referring to is a majority shareholder... still technically not the owner. In practice, the largest shareholder/controlling interest is usually called the owner. Most people would say Musk owns Tesla... ",StrangerFew2424,2025-04-22T19:36:59,2
