"We need a declaratory judgement from the Supreme Court now, not later, interpreting the 22nd amendment.   We know the argument already “it only applies to consecutive terms.”  Ok. Supreme Court. Is that your reading of the Amendment?  If not? Then settle it now.",-Gramsci-,2025-04-25T12:10:42,10

"The comment section is getting this all wrong. There won’t be any running for office. Trump will start a war or invoke martial law or send troops into the border enforcement zone and he will suspend elections and then declare himself President in 2028.   He needs to be removed, one way or another, immediately! Just today they are arresting judges, raiding protesters homes, and announcing increasingly harsh enforcement of journalists for leaks. This is an active fascist coup in plain sight that needs to be put down before it’s too late!",Saber-Rattler-3448,2025-04-25T18:27:58,3

Trumps third term will only apply to him. States are lining up for a constitutional convention.,WhiskeredAristocat,2025-04-25T11:04:14,4
"Trump can't suspend elections as the federal government has nothing to do with them. States run elections, and the only guaranteed thing about elections is that the incumbents have a defined date and time for when their term ends regardless of if they've lost an election or if there was even an election at all.",mkt853,2025-04-25T18:36:22,-1
"There's no constitutional way for Dear Leader to even run again. Rigged, or not, he can't even be on a single ballot. No exceptions. Rewriting the rules takes a constitutional amendment, and that isn't happening. He's talking about a coup.",rickskyscraper3000,2025-04-25T11:13:15,9

"Agreed. Which is why this case should be opened at the SC and then, promptly, shut.   I don’t want to go through 3 years of wondering if the Civil War movie scenario is going to be playing out here.",-Gramsci-,2025-04-25T15:53:38,8
"That’s not true. He signed executive orders to take over independent agencies, one of which is the federal electoral commission. His election overhaul executive order, separate from the one I just mentioned, gives all sorts of federal control over elections. Also, saying he can’t do something should probably stop being a response considering he continues to do things he can’t do because nobody’s stopping him. So what from his actions, past or present, do you think justifies thinking it won’t happen just because it’s not supposed to? He shouldn’t have even been allowed to be on the ballot this election, but there he was. His plan is to either suspend the elections, or control them 100% just like Russia.",Saber-Rattler-3448,2025-04-25T18:59:06,2
"Note the hats say ""Trump 2028.""  I think the current plan is to run either Don Jr. or Eric Trump, and *nudge nudge* we all know Senior would tell them exactly what to do.  So MAGA gets Trump in the White House for a 3rd term, without breaking any laws.",NinjaLanternShark,2025-04-25T13:16:18,3
Time will tell.  I'm hoping that his health & aggressive cognitive decline ensures that he either follows an excellent example set on 4/30 in a year gone by or he cannot be elected POTUS due to total decline.,Huge-Platypus9075,2025-04-25T10:40:22,0
"Will you read the dam news and not articles saying he's selling 2028 merch? Plenty of republicans in congress have already commented on it and said, it's not even serious enough to talk about. It's a f'n joke even to them.",Bruce-7891,2025-04-25T10:33:32,-17

"Yeah and most of the stuff he's tried to do has gotten blocked by the courts. He has done very little to create real change.

"""I'll be a dictator on day one"" was supposed to be a joke, yet here we are.  Read the room.",InertiasCreep,2025-04-25T10:50:37,3
"The point you’re missing is he’s trying all of it. We’re lucky that judges have been able to block him in the things they have, but there is also a ton he has already gotten away with. Are you forgetting about all of the federal workers and veterans he put out of work, the agencies that protect Americans he’s shut down or reduced, the people he’s illegally deported and refuses to get back despite **Supreme Court** rulings? We know Trump talks a lot, but no president should be “joking” about a 3rd term, and we let them get away with it. Joke or not. Talk or not.",Immediate_Theory4738,2025-04-25T12:26:18,3
"Again, what about Trump’s actions past or present suggest that he gives a shit about basic fourth grade social studies or the constitution? This level of naïve is kind of infuriating given the fact that just today they’re arresting judges, raiding homes of protesters, and rescinding protections for journalist. You do remember, he lost an election, and because of that tried to violently overthrow the government right?",Saber-Rattler-3448,2025-04-25T19:12:33,1
"You think everything he says is reality? He can say what ever he wants but its 99% none sense. Pay attention to how he operates? Okay, skrewing up everything he touches and barely functional.

"""Not really making the clever point you're trying to make, but you do you.""  LOL! The Irony. Dude, we saw this play out. What don't you understand about that. A very similar thing happened with the same fucking guy and it got shut down quick. He will not be on a 2028 ballot, and if he refuses to leave and calls on MAGA to march on the capital, it aint going to work. They already tried. Holy hell man.",Bruce-7891,2025-04-25T11:57:00,1
