"She's probably right, but this stupid semantic argument distracts from how wrong her main point was. Bernie and AOC are tapping into what middle class people in both are pissed about. And that's corporations. From price gouging, to fees, to data collection, people have had enough. They may not draw the link to Trump and the billionaire class, but they're tired of getting a 2% cost-of-living increase in their salary (if they're lucky) and seeing their electric bill go up 10%, their internet go up 5%, their cell phone go up 8%, etc.   If democrats like Slotkin would just shut the hell up about their high level theoretical arguments and listen to the people they would understand how to reach more voters.",blueclawsoftware,2025-04-28T15:07:12,43

"At this point, it doesn’t matter which one I personally prefer. I want to win elections and kick the GOP and Trump out of office. In order to do that, the Dems need to win competitive districts and elections. Progressives have not shown any ability to do that. They don’t hold any close (<D+4) districts. Personally I want universal healthcare, minimum income, massive investments in education (both K-12 and college), and tons of other much more left policies. But I believe the best steps we can take towards those are consistent and continuous democratic election victories. Even if it’s mostly moderates, that’s worlds better than Trump and the GOP.  Her plans and strategies were part of why she won in a state that went to Trump. The fact that she’s actually making focus groups, studying voters and trying to fix her messaging to appeal to broader audiences and win the house and Senate back is a good thing IMO.  She worked at the CIA and the DoD. I like that she’s bringing those skills to the table to try and win elections and appeal to the voters.  The progressive plans and visions work in safe Dem areas, but they haven’t shown any progress in winning Republican districts, or taking back the house and Senate.  2026 is already going to be a hard election for Dems to get a Senate majority (simply because of the seats that are up for re-election).  Moderates and centrists did much better than progressives in the previous election. That data can’t be dismissed.",mightcommentsometime,2025-04-28T22:42:56,-1

Experts agree this is not a great definition of bipartisanship.  > Nominate scores fall along a scale of -1 to 1, with -1 being the most liberal end of the spectrum and 1 as the most conservative. Slotkin’s Nominate score is -0.308, making her voting record more conservative than 68% of Democrats in the House.  > Independent analyses indicate Slotkin’s voting and legislative records are more conservative and bipartisan than most of her Democratic colleagues’.  It’s wonderful that Slotkin won her battleground state, but don’t act like she passes some Democratic integrity test. She “compromises” on core Dem values and helped enable Trump’s agenda and the suffering of the people he’s targeted (and of bystanders and children swept up in the process).",rajahbeaubeau,2025-04-29T01:38:22,0
"> Which means she’s willing to stop fighting for some people if it preserves a focus group tested electoral outcome. As is her immigration position.  Does it? Or does it mean changing her language and tone to actually match the electorate?  What’s wrong with using focus groups and reaching out to voters to see what they want? Why is that a bad thing?  She has a 100% rating from the Human Rights Campaign on LGBTQ issues.  > She said Democrats should stop using the term “oligarchy,” a phrase she said doesn’t resonate beyond coastal institutions, and just say that the party opposes “kings.”” > Tone policing sounds pretty weak and woke FWIW That isn’t tone policing, it’s tailoring your message to the electorate. Why is it bad to use analytical methods and testing to try to come up with better messaging that resonates with voters?",mightcommentsometime,2025-04-28T22:32:34,2
Sanders runs as an independent specifically to not be associated with the Democratic Party.  Why are you trying to make him seem like he wants to be a party insider and leader?,mightcommentsometime,2025-04-28T16:59:00,1
"So because the electoral college disproportionately favors certain voters, you want to make that gap even more profound?  Why should my vote for who should be president count any less than anyone else’s? The electoral college already greatly disenfranchises me as a voter. You think the primaries should disadvantage me even more?  I agree that caucuses are dumb. They need to be removed.  Do you think all of the Dem states will actually be solidly on board with having our votes even more disenfranchised?  the Dems shouldn’t be allocating more votes to any person over another. Weighting primary races so that votes in certain states count more is explicitly anti-democratic.",mightcommentsometime,2025-04-28T22:49:50,0
"If someone is using focus groups to determine issues of justice and morality or changing their opinion and tone about who deserves rights based on Republican driven talking points, then they’re a lost cause and a soulless POS.",toomanyshoeshelp,2025-04-28T22:34:35,3
So we shouldn’t try to actually listen to the voters and make plans to win elections?  What good are your progressive morals if you never win elections and the Republicans just get to run everything?  How are you planning on winning elections? By using feels and hoping the American electorate suddenly flips a switch and becomes progressive?,mightcommentsometime,2025-04-28T22:44:56,1
"We should listen to OUR voters, first and foremost. If you can’t turn out the base, nothing else matters.  You can’t outrepublican the republicans on major issues without losing people in your own coalition, for only marginal outcomes.   Guess we should ask presidents Hillary and Kamala how well it worked out for them? Authenticity is important. Clearly the focus group tested, consultant driven method doesn’t win either except when a once in a lifetime pandemic hits.",toomanyshoeshelp,2025-04-28T22:51:00,2
"We listened to OUR VOTERS when Clinton and Biden resoundingly won the primary elections.  Putting Bernie up, or doing what you just suggested would be not listening to the voters and just appointing someone by disenfranchising the voters.  So do you, or do you not want to listen to the voters?  > Clearly the focus group tested, consultant driven method doesn’t win either except when a once in a lifetime pandemic hits.  And what competitive elections have progressives won again?  Moderates and centrists far outperformed progressives in the last election.",mightcommentsometime,2025-04-28T22:57:19,1
