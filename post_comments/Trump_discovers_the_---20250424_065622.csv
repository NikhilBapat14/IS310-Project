"We’ve spent around a century (roughly since WW1) developing a carefully-constructed platform of global military, economic, and diplomatic influence.

"Some tidbits,   >  > Barack Obama used to call the US the “indispensable nation”. In trade and tech terms that is increasingly untrue. >  > ***US aid budgets have massively shrunk relative to China’s***, and the so-called Department of Government Efficiency has more or less closed down their last vestiges in the US Agency for International Development. >  > The US, particularly under Joe Biden, worked hard to deprive China of advanced technology, especially semiconductors. But the failure to match Chinese official and corporate investment, while sending the wrong signals to US industry, ***mean it’s well behind in much of green tech***. If a country wants to adopt solar or wind power or replace internal combustion engines with electric vehicles, including batteries, it will generally get the heavily subsidised kit from China. >  > The Rhodium Group consultancy estimates that China’s share of global exports in solar cells and modules was 53.5 per cent in 2023, up from 35.5 per cent 10 years previously, and had risen above 50 per cent for lithium-ion batteries and semi-finished EVs. >  > ***This week, a Biden initiative came to fruition in the announcement of mesospheric tariffs of up to 3,521 per cent on solar cells from south-east Asian countries***. >  > But the US, its indigenous car industry skewed by trade protection towards giant gas-guzzling pick-up trucks that no other country wants, is creating a low-tech, ***high-priced EV sector that cannot compete overseas***. >  > The US has long used market access as bait for trading partners to cut tariffs, adopt US rules on intellectual property rights and so forth. Probably the last hurrah for this tactic was the painstakingly created Trans-Pacific Partnership, signed by 12 Asia-Pacific countries in 2016 and designed to encircle China with US-oriented economies. >  > ***But Congress held the agreement up before Trump pulled the US out altogether in 2017***. The spurned countries went ahead and turned the TPP into the “comprehensive and progressive” CPTPP without the US, excising IP provisions that had been included at Washington’s insistence. >  > The Biden administration attempted to restore US influence in the Asia-Pacific with the “Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity”. But that merely created bemusement in the region by attempting to coax partner countries to adopt US labour standards and other rules without offering export markets in return. >  > Trump’s idea is to threaten to take market access away with high tariffs and then restore it in return for trade concessions. ***It’s all stick and no carrot***. The credibility of his threat to impose permanently high import duties is subject to the whim of the financial markets, and his trustworthiness in keeping those taxes low following a deal exceedingly suspect. >  > In the global game of trade poker, Trump inherited a weakening hand and is playing it extremely badly. Bessent and his other officials are in a precarious position.***The US does not have the aid, the technology or the market access to exert control over global trade the way it once did, and Trump’s erratic behaviour is rapidly increasing the probability that it never will***. >",tech57,2025-04-24T07:09:49,105

While this view is optimistic about global growth of renewables, heat pumps and EVs, it also indicates a slower and dirtier path for the U.S. >  > Bond argues that since most countries do not have plentiful oil and gas within their borders, they need to import it and have confidence in the stability of supply and pricing. As that confidence erodes, they will look to alternatives. >  > Most countries do not have substantial solar panel, wind turbine or battery production, so reliance on those resources would also require imports.

The buyer isn’t signing up for dependence on daily shipments of fuel. >  > This isn’t some fanciful theory.

"Absolutely that too, especially the disgusting and unconscionably moral bankruptcy of abandoning and then extorting Ukraine. And the fact that obsequiously tying our entire national defence posture to the US military-industrial complex instead of making choices which help us gain a measure of sovereignty over our own national defence, is the thing that neither major Party dare even contemplate",brezhnervouz,2025-04-24T23:24:34,3
"The irony is that under US pressure we dropped the tarrifs we had on non Australian made cars (despite the main two 'locals' being FORD and GM), which opened the market to US made cars, but instead Japanese and European models became affordable instead and so Ford and GM shut up shop.

"Genghis Khan was one person. Colonial powers did atrocious and genocidal acts over a 150+ year period to the native population, acts that the US continued to do. Much like India is not responsible for every atrocity under British colonial rule, the US isn't responsible for Spain funding Columbus.  And to re-frame this slightly: the US becoming independent made the world more multipolar. Acting like this in itself is a good or bad thing misses the point that most governments who want this *right now* are largely authoritarian.",The_frozen_one,2025-04-24T12:50:06,2

"No problem; it's a complicated question anyway with a ton of nuance required if you're going to consider it in any real depth. 'Pretensions/ambitions to benevolent hegemony', at random points in time maybe lol  But of course like any country, America has always acted in its ultimate own best interests; but that becomes more of a potential issue when you are the wealthiest/most powerful nation with military spending greater than the next 9 countries combined that has ever existed in human history, and your Govt decides to go autocrat-rogue 🤔  If I can add a pertinent and thought-provoking link, here is a conversation between Jon Stewart and the wonderful Rory Stewart (of 'The Rest is Politics') for anyone interested  [Jon Stewart & Rory Stewart on Trump’s Restructured Global Order](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-smySDPNU)",brezhnervouz,2025-04-24T23:13:08,1
