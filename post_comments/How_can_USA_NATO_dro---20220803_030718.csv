">last time I rembember it was that Soleimani guy from Iran that they stright up bombed in another country's teritory, just like that and nobody cares that it happend like that.  They did.  It was actually a pretty big international incident and required the intervention of Germany and Japan to prevent it from escalating.  The USA and Iran were extremely close to going to war at that point.",Naliamegod,2022-08-03T22:30:38,7
"We are at war with terrorism. This was authorized under [""H.J.Res.64 - 107th Congress (2001-2002): Authorization for Use of Military Force ](https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-joint-resolution/64)  Basically we can use deadly force to prevent terrorism against us, anywhere, anytime.",2lisimst,2022-08-03T16:08:44,8
"Yes, they pretty much broke ""international law"". But the US doesn't recognize the international criminal court.  And nobody makes a fuzz about it because it's a crime done by our side. They sometimes get mentioned in media, but we hardly hear about it.  The US army raped a child and killed her family, including a six year old, to cover it up but that hardly got attention. And Australian soldiers were driving around in Afghanistan with a Swastika-flag attached to their jeep. But most people don't remember those events.  Moral of the story is that if you're strong enough you can get away with anything you want.  > But then what's stoping other countries in doing that, just label someone from another country a terrorist and bomb him?  You need permission from the US. That's why Israel usually gets away with assassinating Iranian citizens and scientists.",Hapsbum,2022-08-04T17:26:05,3
But wouldn’t that still be a attack on another nation. Not everyone has the same laws as the USA.,larrysmallwood,2022-08-03T17:41:42,2
Yeah it's kinda like... who ever has the biggest/most guns gets to make the decisions on what is it isnt right xD,[deleted],2022-08-05T05:22:25,2
"Also, one of the conditions of the Doha Agreement, which negotiated the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, was that the Taliban would not harbor terrorists, so it can be said that the Taliban violated the agreement that established peace between the U.S. and the Taliban, that providing an additional legal justification.",loselyconscious,2022-08-03T21:59:00,5
"Yes, it would. The US defends it under two principles: self-defense against terrorism, and “what are you gonna do about it.”",cpast,2022-08-03T19:44:49,5
"Depends on how the other nation sees it. In the case of Zawahiri it is an immense embarrassment to the Taliban that the head of Al-Qaeda was in their capital after they signed the Doha Agreemrnt explicitly pledging not to harbor Al-Qaeda. They aren’t going to war over this, and Zawahiri isn’t an Afghanistani citizen anyway.",abolishpatreon,2022-08-05T16:08:19,1
Wasn't this what happened when we went into the middle east after 9/11?  I do remember someone saying some years back that we never declared war.,[deleted],2022-08-05T05:11:35,1
