"From the article...  >About 59% of Americans disapprove of Trump’s sweeping tariffs on imported goods, the Pew Research Center survey found.  Lest we forget, the actual monetary effects of tRump's tariffs are just now [beginning to be seen in the collections by US Customs](https://archive.ph/9ROKO) \- the actual money collections really didn't hit anybody till mid April. What that means is (a) that you haven't even seen the price increases that the tRump taxes (AKA tariffs) will inevitably cause and (b) that all of the market turmoil and business angst occurring right now are the results of mere anticipation of the coming damage - and businesses are tempering their anticipation while clinging to desperate hopes for a ""best case scenario"".   My message here is this:   Better buckle up! Counting on a ""best case scenario"" for anything inflicted (infected?) by the Orange Malady is largely a failure of imagination, and is always a fools errand.",phosdick,2025-04-24T09:58:42,1

"Colorful answers aside, the real metric is their everyday lives. Not everyone or every industry is feeling the squeeze yet, and they are still taking him at his word that his “strategy” will pay off in the end.  Most (maybe all) of the people I work with are Trump voters. Last year was one of our worst years, damn near had to lay people off and we’re a small company, only about ~40 employees. Business started to pick up around last August and has been rocking ever since. We hired 3 more employees and are looking for more.   Anyway, my point is that last year, when we were being told by the democrats that the economy was actually doing great, business for us was bad. Now that the general message is that the economy is in the shitter, a recession is looming, we’ve been crushing it. 🤷‍♂️",HenryDorsettCase47,2025-04-23T17:52:19,2
