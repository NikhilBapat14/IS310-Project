"He's looking for a way out. I believe he was personally looking to pump and dump the market a couple of times (mostly done there) and then ink some non-binding manufacturing agreements then declare victory.  It seems that he got more than he bargained for with China knowing full well that the stepped in his own trap, along with the potential of a fundamental global trade restructure that will cause lasting damage to the US economy. So now even the dumbest president in the world can see that his monument to history will be a granite urinal if things don't get fixed in the very near future.  So he wants to bail ASAP.  Most of his core voters still completely trust him so if he says he inked a deal with the penguins of Heard Island and the trade war was a success they'll be ecstatic.  The stock market will climb by 15% and he'll be the 'art of the deal' hero they believe he is.  It's all fake. All of it.",Pretty-Balance-Sheet,2025-04-25T09:44:35,2

"The number of nations in the UN is 193. There are 197 that the US formally recognizes. You could maybe add around 10 more if we‚Äôre talking entities that are functionally sovereign but not acknowledged by the international community.
