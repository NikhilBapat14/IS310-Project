">“This is not a question of accommodating things that we don’t agree with or watering down or changing our values. It is a question that we have to make very clear to everybody: how your everyday life is different if we’re in charge compared to if they’re in charge,” Buttigieg said.   >“The truth is, protoauthoritarian governments do not just come out of nowhere. We would not be here in this situation if the government, the economy, and the politics of our country were healthy. They’ve been unhealthy for a long time,” Buttigieg told MSNBC’s Jen Psaki.   >“If my party seems like it’s calling for a return to a status quo from before, that would be both substantively wrong, and politically it would fail,” he continued.

Republicans give the people someone to blame:  immigrants.  Democrats need to give the people someone to blame: oligarchs.  Democrats have the advantage of being true. Oligarchs (or hedge funds or private equity, whatever word you want to use) buy up all your real estate and raise your rent. They buy up all your doctors offices and raise the price for worse care. We won't win the election by telling voters that we will give them a chance to apply for means tested subsidies to help them afford these predatory prices.

They need to push policies that are radical departures from the systems we've had and which failed us.  \- nationalize healthcare  \- UBI  \- national minimum wage that is also a living wage  \- robust whistleblower protections  \- tax the rich - the combination of higher minimum wages and higher taxes on the wealthy should result in a shrinking of a wage gap. If the gap continues to widen, we're not being paid enough and the rich aren't being taxed enough.  \- recognize the danger of propaganda like fox news and make it illegal for anyone to claim their opinions are as valid as actual facts.  \- international and domestic policy realignment to favor true democracies and oppose authoritarianism.  I'm sure everyone here can think of a dozen other places our historic systems have failed to keep the people safe while serving only the richest among us.

"Here's the thing - Pete is a fantastic politician, he really is. I don't trust him, though. He's too centrist for my taste, i.e. too close to the status quo. I like Bernie's ideas, but I thought he shot too high and didn't articulate his main priorities well enough (and thus was primed for fighting too many fights) Biden surprised me with some of his progressive policies, but he was obviously a centrist, status quo president. I want someone in the middle of those two.  I am afraid Pete will say all the right things and get people behind him and then implement more status quo policies with a touch of progressivism. He didn't wow me as the Transport Sec. His record as mayor also didn't wow me. It's entirely possible he gets in office and passes some really good, progressive policy because he sees where the people are and meets the moment. I'm also terrified he won't and will play it safe. Either outcome is plausible to me, and playing it safe seems like the more likely option to me.  He's an excellent messenger, I just don't trust his leadership.",Gertrude_D,2025-05-07T19:54:21,3

"Pete Buttigieg is the perfect example of why the feckless Democrats have a record low (27%) approval rating. He's a glib neoliberal shill out of McKinsey (see John Oliver on why McKinsey is basically the Mordor of neoliberal capitalism).

Oh, yeah, the friend of labor that couldn't even bring up card check.   ""Mayor Pete"" has never done anything but be a middling mayor in a middling city where black people have nothing good to say about him.

Giving guns to the common people is like a joke. The truth? Is that many so called American who were born here, choose to ignore the law because they believe they can get away with it.  Democrats, liberals, conservatives, non politician. Stop pretending and putting your head in the ground. This system was broken from the beginning, because Americans would choose to point a gun at their fellow man and kill them because it’s easy. Our country is a mess. School shootings, drug abuse, when did this become our normal?  The Republican party recognized the reality we are in and took advantage of it. Democracy has failed us, so now they’re trying to copy China who succeeded as their model.   Admit it. We’re not as good as them as a society.

I bet you guys still have those damn Teflon air fryers and use non stick pans at home. Just stick to iron and steel, why did you even choose that cheap garbage?

In my opinion, stop and check online about contaminants and safety before buying or doing ANYTHING. This is the only thing that helps keep you safer and live smarter.

"There’s currently a lawsuit by 12 states before the US Court of International Trade that argues Trump doesn’t have the power to unilaterally enact tariffs because the emergency powers law he cited doesn’t grant the President the authority to enact tariffs: for context, this law is most often used to freeze the assets of hostile foreign governments, tariffs have literally never been justified using this law. They also just filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to have Trump’s tariffs paused while litigation is ongoing, so we’ll see how that goes. Even if the lawsuit succeeds though, there are absolutely other laws granting the president vast national emergency powers that need to be restrained or repealed, but that would require Congress to re-assert itself as an equal branch of government instead of mostly following the whims of the President as the *de facto* political party leader.",cvanguard,2025-05-08T01:08:33,4

Kamala ran as a last minute option, and got there not on her on merits as a leader, but as a ""Biden"" associate. The last time democratic voters casted their votes because they wanted to elect a candidate, as opposed to wanting to prevent another candidate from winning, was Obama.   With all his flaws, he had a clear vision, which Biden, Hillary, and Kamala never did, or at least were completely unable to communicate clearly. And Obama, unlike the other three, rose to prominence on his own, from bottom. Biden was a walking corpse, better known as Obama's vice president. Hillary was known first as the wife of a former president, and then for her role as an unelected official at Obama's white house. And Kamala was mostly known as Biden's vice president.   I agree with you that there will never be perfect candidates. But voters don't need that, they need a leader. Trump is a leader, although a nefarious and despicable one. Obama was a leader. Biden, Hillary, and Harris never were. In my view anyway.   Trump was an outsider. Conquered his space at the party by amassing public support. Obama was a politician already, but he also conquered his space at the top of the party by amassing public support, especially with that famous speech he delivered still as a senator.

It's perfectly understandable to be skeptical of someone with Buttigieg's background and stated policies on subjects other than the batch you can cheer for.

"There will be an election in 2028 without Trump on the ballot BECAUSE of the 22nd amendment, but a JD Vance presidency will be a de facto one. Even when Trump talked about third terms, I predicted JD Vance would run in 2028. And I was right, because Trump said “well instead of a third term, I’ll either run JD Vance or Marco Rubio”. Not only Trump isn’t exactly a tolerant person when it comes to non-white people, but JD Vance has been very beneficial to Trump’s ego, and he likes people who stroke his ego. So, he’ll do anything for JD Vance, and letting him run in the 2028 election will be a big gift for him.  As a result, you should vote blue in 2028, even if the Democrat who’s on the ballot is a non-awake coma patient. JD is 10 times smarter than Trump and has a much more radical agenda, particularly a weird obsession with a federal abortion ban, abolishing divorce and things like traditional family and demographics. If he gets elected in 2028, it will be the biggest disaster for women’s rights in a Western nation. You should also vote blue in the 2026 midterms so that not only Congress would be a check and balance against Trump, but also so that, in case JD Vance wins the 2028 election, he won’t have the capability to end abortion on a federal level on day one.  Another thing you should worry about when it comes to 2028 is a very particular person: Elon Musk. This guy showed his quest for election interference didn’t end in the 2024 election, as he meddled with an election in Germany and a Supreme Court election in Wisconsin. Canada and Australia were pretty lucky that Elon didn’t interfere with their elections (and I have no doubt he first thought about it), and Australia had to tell him off after they saw Germany. I’m worried about a possible interference of his in the snap presidential election in South Korea and the French presidential election in 2027 (I’m French), and you should definitely worry about Elon interfering with the midterms but also in elections in swing states and more especially in 2028 because Elon will be Vance’s number 1 backer. It doesn’t matter if he’s hated by many people, he still has a social media platform which is very used (especially by his remaining fans and the most hardcore right-wingers) and his money definitely isn’t hated.",Hero-Firefighter-24,2025-05-08T12:35:25,1

"And thus becomes the importance of the legislature. If you run a candidate who's just ""diet right"" (Harris, Biden) forever, you'll inevitably lose to the right on the executive. That means even if you have the legislature, your entire agenda will get vetoed. And good luck overriding everything. Even with a super majority, which is unlikely, some members of your party wouldn't be willing to override even if they were willing to vote for the bill. They'd see the veto as a sign that it wouldn't be electorally smart for them to override. So the game becomes an executive who will sign your agenda, and advance it, but has broad enough appeal to win, but is actually left of center. That's where Pete falls. He's actually left of center, but not in the ""scary"" way. I've never understood that. Then you have to elect a truly liberal legislature.  The alternate becomes shit gets bad enough under trump that we finally break people free from this fear of socialist policies, which would actually benefit everyone. But for that to happen there has to be someone like FDR or Abe to appear. Charismatic in the right way for the right time, can speak incredibly well and communicate well. And knows how to make the right moral arguments and then execute policy on them. Right now Pete is the closest thing to that. So whether that's the McKinsey in him, or actually him, I'd argue the latter given his track record would be hard to fake for this long, he's the best there is and we ride that and shape him into who we want, or someone else better will emerge through the fray.

"The DNC has done a good job of burying Pete's corporatist past and avoids mentioning his good friends. But with a little work, you can see where he came from...  from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg  >in 2007, Buttigieg became a consultant at the Chicago office of McKinsey & Company,[51][52] where he worked on energy, retail, economic development, and logistics for three years.[53][54] ... His work at McKinsey included trips to Iraq and Afghanistan, which he rarely discusses.  from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinsey_%26_Company  >McKinsey has been the subject of significant controversy and is the subject of multiple criminal investigations into its business practices. The company has been criticized for its role promoting OxyContin use during the opioid crisis in North America, its work with Enron, and its work for authoritarian regimes like Saudi Arabia and Russia.[9][10][11][12] The criminal investigation by the US Justice Department, with a grand jury to determine charges, is into its role in the opioid crisis and obstruction of justice related to its activities in the sector.[13] McKinsey works with some of the largest fossil fuel producing governments and companies, including to increase fossil fuel demand.[14][15]  This is where Pete's experience lies. After this, he went directly into politics.  From running for the chairmanship of the DNC (completely owned and controlled by the 1%) to being a high profile Biden (a corporatist compromiser with he GOP for over 50 years) surrogate, Pete is not a progressive on the key issues Americans face.   For example:  >Buttigieg supports a constitutional amendment on campaign finance to reduce the undue influence of money in politics  This is a DNC sponsored red herring. The only actual fix for the election problems in America is public campaign financing. You know, like all of the rest of the free world does...and why their politicians aren't completely co-opted by the 1%.  The reason it's a red herring is two-fold. First, the Citizens United ruling is a first amendment issue. One cannot upend CU (which is not the problem in American politics) without sabotaging the first amendment. So this is impossible...and everyone knows it.   Second, calling a constitutional convention or getting the number of states needed to ratify any amendment is absolutely impossible with the current 1% control of both major parties. It's like saying that they want Santa to solve the problem.  And finally, it's actually completely unnecessary. As Roberts already made clear, Congress already has all the power and laws it needs (and they have already been found constitutional) to enact public campaign financing and end the hold big money has on our politicians. There are a number of bills already in congress to do this very thing. But the GOP just ignores them, of course, while the DNC (under Pelosi, Jeffries, etc.) just refuses to even bring them up for a vote...even when they have the majority in both/either house.  In short, this red herring is intended to sound like Democrats want campaign finance reform, while keeping it from ever happening -- per the orders of the 1% who don't want to give up control of our political class for obvious reasons.  In short, Pete pretends he ""progressive"" by taking the progressive side of social issues -- the kind of issues that keep Americans divided while the status quo DNC and tax cut RNC rob Americans blind administration after administration while nothing meaningful changes.  I could go on and on. But, in short, Pete is not actually a progressive in the way Sanders, AOC, and others actually are.",Zahgi,2025-05-07T22:52:39,-5

"> Hmm that sounds a lot like a defense of the status quo.   Democrats in 2020 won on ""return to status quo"".   The problem is that it never happened.  They half assed it.  They needed to punish those who manipulated the system to commit heinous crimes and corrupt illegal acts.  Instead the slow walked Trump and toher prosecutions *to give the appearance of status quo and fairness*.  Instead it made those watching from the GOP side realize they were getting away with it, and it opened the door for Trump's return.   They ran on status quo and won with it, and Buttigieg was part of that.   Now though, there's two main things to consider.  First, they tried it a second time and it failed miserably.  Trump won this time.  So while a politician like Buttigieg would be *in the right* in 2020 to support return to status quo, as that lead to them winning the White House, it would be wrong to *continue* to be on board with that after it lost in 2024.   Secondly, Trump's return has seen them tearing up the condition and the government and making it basically impossible to simply reverse.  So at this point, a return to status quo isn't only an ill advised campaign trail message, it's *literally* not possible.  Assuming we can actually get a fair election and Dems win, they're going to spend all of their time putting in 1000 hours of investigating, planning, getting approval for rebuilding, and rebuilding, for every hour DOGE spent destroying things.  They will spend most of their time trying to to pick up the pieces.   We can't return to status quo because it's gone, and any voter whot thinks putting a Dem in the White House fixed this in 4 or 8 years is setting themselves up for disappointment.   It's going to take decades to fix, and a steadfast voting populace that stays the course.  Which, as we've seen from the tiktok generations, is basically impossible.  But at least they're trying to temper expectations now, lest we put in some Dems and everything isn't fixed in 4/8 years and they give up on voting and let the GOP right back in.",DebentureThyme,2025-05-07T22:29:23,4

"If you want to know, the video will do a better job than I can summarize because it shows Pete speaking.  Medicare for all - he was very pro then admonished democrats in debate over support for Medicare for all.  Indiana treasury candidate Pete ran on getting special interest money out of politics and said taking money from a bank he would have influence over in a government capacity is a conflict of interest. In presidential candidate debate he said he would be proud to be supported by the wealthy, trying imply there is nothing wrong with being supported, and that it doesn’t impact his policy decisions. He has been photographed at fundraiser events with billionaires in wine caves.  In debate he raised his hand to agree with the statement that border crossings should be decriminalized. A month later in another debate he was asked about the border and said that crossing should remain illegal. When asked why he rose his hand last debate he was flustered. He later went on to admonish those who support decriminalizing the border as following along with a left wing purity test.  On Mehdi’s podcast he was asked if he supported getting rid of the electoral college. Pete’s words were “Of course, I’ve been saying that since day one.”. In the same interview he called for structural reform of the Supreme Court. A NYT article talked about bundlers telling him both weren’t popular, and he took it out of his stump speeches quietly.  The final point is highlighting how when he was 18 he won a JFK profile in courage essay titled “Bernie Sanders” where he expresses enthusiasm for Bernie’s politics and how he carries himself. During his campaign in 2020, he was attacking Bernie in weird ways with smear attacks that don’t line up with his previous positions. Mehdi concedes 18 was a long time ago but highlights how he has flip flopped on these major issues all for the worse.  Reading the room and saying the right thing to impress on people that you are there for them, then pivoting based on your next audience shows that you inherently don’t stand on principles. I think his record of working at McKinsey and that his politics are fungible based on what he needs to say shows he’ll have no courage and sabotage the working class if the donor class asks it of him. He is smart though, and that’s why I do not want to see him in power.

If Buttigieg's message is change but his policies aren't, we're in for a bad time.

That will make it easier for Rs to attack, and even easier still for Rs to in time come back into power and take it down, as it's not cost-effective. I'd rather run on universal healthcare and compromise at public option, then run on public option and inevitably get nothing.  Buttigieg has some forward thinking ideas, but none of them tackle the problems that matter most. Yes, he could be the big rail president we need. Yes, he could be the $15 minimum wage president. And so many other things that are so overdue that by the time we get them they won't be of value without a host of other changes. The $15 minimum wage is not enough \*today\*, nor was it when he ran on it.

Buttigieg KNEW exactly what kind of company McKinsey was, and he had every opportunity to do something more constructive with his life at that time. He could have found a job at a nonprofit. He could have interned for a progressive Democrat in congress, possibly even Bernie Sanders. Trying to write off this complaint as ""he was just a young kid straight out of college"" is disingenuous.

But sure I'll engage, how did I rewrite history?  edit: to respond to fordat1 who blocked me because clearly they knew they were wrong and couldn't handle it lmao, you seem confused and to think that I'm suggesting this is a winning strategy when the original comment was about how the people should act in response to campaigns, not what strategy the campaigns should use.",Top-Passage2914,2025-05-08T07:33:20,0
"You seem to have misunderstood my original comment as being a suggestion of how candidates should run their campaigns when in actuality it was about how we the people should be reacting to the campaigns.

Why do the people that just ate shit and lost by trying to sheepdog conservative voters talk like they’re an authority on winning?  You’re not going to break conservatives away from the Republicans. Stop trying. It’s unimaginably dumb.,Loves_His_Bong,2025-05-07T23:29:47,4

"I’m sorry, I didn’t take you as confrontational. I don’t mean to be either, but I can see how I give that impression.   The way I see the messaging issue is, we’re somehow convinced we need to make incremental change and work within the system to convince the system to change. However, that’s been the norm for decades and look where it got us. At some point, the people have to decide that their priorities should be put first, not behind whatever the donor or political class think is realistic. The problem as I see it is an entire political and propaganda apparatus insistent on maintaining the structure that underlies all these problems and leads to something like Trump.   Plenty of other countries have more leftist parties and policies; they don’t have some magic knowledge about messaging that the US doesn’t. They do, however, operate in different systems and contexts. That indicates that the messaging isn’t the issue, but the system the messaging takes place in.   One could argue that we must adapt the messaging to the system we live in; I would argue the system is broken and there’s no sense limiting ourselves to working within it. There should be major political changes in the US. We should call out the bias against positive social and economic change. We should be fed up with being told to be realistic, to build coalitions with people who have interest in doing so, to compromise on social safety nets, and to be patient because change must happen at a snail’s pace. The two party system has reached its end stage, time for something else. Ideally more democratic than authoritarian.",thegistofit,2025-05-08T22:45:20,1
"But you didn't say that. You ran an entire thread on essentially hallucinating what you wanted to argue into what people said and then getting irritated at them when they pointed out that what you said wasn't what the discussion was about and that you failed to provide and link or relation to the discussion. Had you made this your first comment about how if Pete is considered a more left member of an administration then the administration is not progressive when viewed in a historical context you'd have had a valid point. But that's not what you did.   Clarity of communication matters, especially in a presidential candidate, and you've kind of perfectly illustrated why Pete and not other members of the current democratic party is actually a very good possible candidate, because he can actually communicate ideas clearly and effectively, something that seems to be in extremely short supply from a lot of Democrats, both in office, and as you've demonstrated, in the broader public.",im_a_squishy_ai,2025-05-08T12:37:52,0

">Well no you nitpicked one part of the comment that wasn't even the main point  your main point was about ""strategy"" my ""nitpick"" (your phrasing) was about how your strategy failed 2 out of 3 times historically with Trump.  to claim you arent giving a strategy but just documenting a human response is a cop out. You got blocked because you clearly where just going to weasel your way out of claiming you said nothing but something at the same time like this bs  >how the people should act in response to campaigns, not what strategy the campaigns should use.",fordat1,2025-05-08T07:35:39,3

"Well that makes a lot more sense! So as a follow up, yes I do know that Hillary Clinton was campaigning for universal health care. One of my earliest policy related memories is her getting spat on while she was out campaigning for that. It's pretty fascinating that 30 years later she's pilloried as a neolib.  If the ACA is a stepping stone you don't believe that Medicare for all who want it is just a fancy way of saying add a public option which would be another incremental step towards universal health care or true medicare for all?",Gnagus,2025-05-07T23:23:45,1

"I think ""for those who want it"" immediately detracts from ""for all""   The point of universality is that it is here for you.    Nobody says ""the right to vote for those who want it.""   ""The right to life for those who want it""   Universal rights are universal. And none of them are compulsory. The idea you need to slip in some exit clause is opening a question where none needs to be    It's also worth noting that ""Medicare for all"" is already wildly popular. Well over half the country has supported it for a full decade (longer?) so why if you have a successful rallying point would you change anything about it? Why equivocate? It's stupidity. It's naivety.    And you'll notice it did so poorly with the public that Pete dropped it.    The other point is if you want to win you need to bring together the biggest group you can. There's no bigger group than ""for all"" as opposed to ""for some""",PennCycle_Mpls,2025-05-08T00:16:45,1

"Well then passing the ACA was a mistake because it doesn't make government healthcare available to all citizens? I thought we had said it was the incremental change we needed to build upon. Why isn't the public option another step towards universal healthcare.   Medicare for all is popular where I live and we have a congressman that supports it but if it was wildly popular outside bright blue districts like mine wouldn't we have a majority in Congress supporting it rather than a minority of our own party. Do voters in less blue, purple and red districts love the policy but are also so easily swayed by billionaires that they won't elect politicians that support it?",Gnagus,2025-05-08T01:03:56,1
"The ACA is now chiefly responsible for skyrocketing insurance and industry costs. It's now removed competition entirely from the market and spread both risks and profit to every buyer in the market.   If the public option were passed today, the industry would dump everyone ""unprofitable"" on to the public option and only offer private market to people aged 18-32 with zero health conditions and then turn around claiming ""look how well it works! Best outcomes, easy profit, and low cost!""   Meanwhile the public option would be completely overwhelmed with the most costly cases.  It's the exact same thing as charter schools in some states. Reject anyone with a learning disability, or special care needs, then brag saying ""see how much better we are than public schools?""   The solution is simple. You nationalize it. Just like the fire department. Just like police. Just like the military. You rebuild and reopen rural hospitals. You fund the medical end of the industry. You manage and fund the insurance in the exact way we've done with the most successful public insurance policy for over 90 years. Social security. And you eliminate the contribution cap on both of them entirely.",PennCycle_Mpls,2025-05-08T10:38:07,1
"I'm sorry I must be confused. I started having this conversation with you because you said the ACA was a good first incremental step but here you're saying it's responsible for for skyrocketing costs and is actually made the situation worse?   I was also asking more about being an incremental step as far as what's politically viable as you can tell from my second paragraph. I'm now saying that Medicare for all wouldn't be great I'm just not sure that telling everybody how much better it would be allows us to win them over with merely or righteousness. You're saying an incremental step like a Medicare for all who want it will make the situation worse, you're also saying the ACA didn't actually help because of skyrocketing costs but meanwhile the ACA is wildly popular when polled. So we have a situation where we took an incremental step but is now widely popular but you are saying it's made the situation worse and rather than take another incremental step we should push for something that is less politically viable which I think is shown by the lack of votes in congress. I'm curious how we would actually get Medicare for all past, when Bernie is asked questions like that he would often answer that we'll have a revolution but I feel like that's pretty vague and lacks any kind of tactics and strategy that are actionable which is really my worry.",Gnagus,2025-05-08T11:22:50,1
