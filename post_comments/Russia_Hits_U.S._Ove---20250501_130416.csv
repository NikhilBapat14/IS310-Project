Are you going to take all the Ukraine this time? Not just some of it and then realize it's a giant stalemate? Why didn't you take it earlier? You got the easy parts now you have to fight through the rivers and the mud.,TheGlen,2025-05-01T14:33:24,87

Gonna disappear in three days.     Sound familiar.   Where have I heard that before?,old---,2025-05-01T20:46:27,10
Hopefully Trump gets the message after this. Russia doesn't want peace. It never has.,ergzay,2025-05-01T18:05:39,41
"Reading the article, doesn't sound like Putin is threatening the US at all. His exact words were:  “Trump has finally pressured the Kiev regime to pay for US aid with mineral resources. Now, the country that is about to disappear will have to use its national wealth to pay for military supplies.”  More like he's taunting Ukraine that their freeloading off the US has ended. Not that he has beef with the US.",G102Y5568,2025-05-01T17:51:45,41
It doesn’t seem like Putin has any intention of backing down. I hope President Trump hits Russia hard with tariffs or sanctions like we have with China.   I’m sure Tucker Carlson is hoping everyone forgets that shameful display of an interview he did with Putin a little while back. Wasn’t a good look then and has aged like McConnell in front of a mic since,Nyxaus_Motts,2025-05-01T17:41:22,22
"This is scary times. Mr Putin will meet the real Donald Trump, if he keeps throwing threats around.  No one wants world war 3, but Putin needs be taken down a notch with some sanctions or something.",Dazzling_Pink9751,2025-05-01T14:02:41,27
"Well if this is a war over Ukraine’s minerals, then I suppose this mineral deal is our closest ticket getting into this war more directly like the war hawks would love to see.   Fact is Putin wants Ukraine period, not just crimea",Racheakt,2025-05-02T04:18:46,2
Guess that shows how non-interested Putin actually is to pull out.,vampirepomeranian,2025-05-02T08:43:54,2
"I seriously don't understand how this mineral deal was supposed to help... it just gives Russia even more of an incentive to NOT stop the war... last thing they need is another Western nation with their foothold in Ukraine. Since they are winning, why bother stopping now?",GeneticsGuy,2025-05-02T03:26:24,2
I mean Russia already controls a huge chunk of mineral land of Ukraine. This mineral deal between US and Ukraine is about US plundering the land that's left as much as possible before Russia takes Ukraine. Ukraine has to pay back somehow for our military contributions.,octaviobonds,2025-05-01T22:11:35,-2
I mean the veil was extremely frail and flimsy and covered every but the true intentions. This was putins goal of creating the new ussr again under false and pretty unconvincing pretenses.,Katzchen12,2025-05-01T16:41:52,186
He told basically told Tucker Carlson Ukraine was an imaginary state and he didn't respect their sovereignty. ,According-Activity87,2025-05-01T23:40:32,53
"> Now he almost makes it sound like conquest was the goal all along  I mean it was always the goal all along. Listen to Putin's interview with Tucker Carlson where he waxes poetic about Imperial Russia and how the concept of Ukraine doesn't exist (with lots of fake made up history). https://www.rev.com/transcripts/tucker-carlson-interviews-vladimir-putin-transcript  > I thought they were only in ukraine to fight nazi's and protect donbas.  Protecting donbas and fighting Nazis were always completely invented excuse given that the donbas was not in fact being repeatedly attacked by Ukraine and Ukraine has no bigger ""nazi problem"" than anywhere else in Europe or the US for that matter. I mean think about who goes around calling people nazis, far left lunatics. Putin doing it is no different.",ergzay,2025-05-01T18:07:21,99
"He isn’t stupid, but he is old. He doesn’t have much time left to leave a legacy, so this is his play and it seems he will go to every length to achieve it. Backing down might not even be an option at this point, considering the people who he surrounds himself with (i.e. potential successors).   There’s really only one route to “victory” for Putin.",MiceTonerAccount,2025-05-01T17:04:14,71

"Russia already made it clear what needs to happen for peace to happen. This mineral deal is not it. Russia drew a clear red line, and Lavrov spelled it again this week:  Ukraine has to concede all the lands Russia currently controls as Russian lands. NATO has to be completely gone from Ukraine, and Ukraine needs to declare itself as a neutral state....and forth, since Zelensky is an illegitimate president (due to cancelling elections) Ukraine has to hold elections, elect a legitimate president to sign all these agreements that Russia has put forth.  There is no other deal that Russia has on the table for the Ukraine problem. And because Russia has an initiative on the front, it does not not need to reconcile any of its positions.  What is US going to do, send troops to stop Russia? If that happens, its the end of Trump's presidency.",octaviobonds,2025-05-01T22:21:03,-21
What more sanctions can be done? The only next step is war.,Negative-Negativity,2025-05-01T14:24:03,72
"Then why didn't we call his bluff? Why did Boris get Zelenskyy to back out of the deal he was elected to sign? If this was Putin's plan all along why did we give him all these talking points needlessly? Why ban the Russian language? Why say you're going to bring Ukraine into nato? Why shell donbas instead of supporting their right to self determination and a vote on independence? Why give Putin the justification at all?  Wars are a lot easier to prevent than they are to stop once they've started because of sunk costs and worsening relations that comes with war. The bulk of the casualties were already spent by Russia let's say they had to spend 80% to go in and get 20% of Ukraine, it will just cost them 20% more now to take the whole thing. And if they don't take the whole thing it's a cost because they risk future attacks from Ukraine when they could just eliminate that possibility now.  It's wrong to assume that if Russia wants to go all the way now that they always were going to do that. Quite frankly I don't believe that's true. The same people saying that are the same ones who told us the ghost of Kiev and Russia was going to lose when anyone with half a brain knew that was bullshit.",day25,2025-05-02T00:07:20,-36
"I'd agree, but Europe would rather eat dirt, puke it up, and re-eat that puke before buying US oil exports. Part of their overall ""America sucks!! Americans are stupid!!!......but you're still going to protect us and give us NATO money, right?"" mantra.",ITrCool,2025-05-01T15:59:29,32
"So why do they need the North Koreans then? Why are the signing bonuses so large? Russia is struggling to, even if they have some ways yet around their shortages.",iowaisflat,2025-05-02T10:45:26,5
"I mean Russia’s made it clear how they’d like peace to happen but the country crumbling down around Putin would probably do it too right? They can’t sustain this war if Ukraine has our backing. They are relying on North Korean conscripts which leads me to believe things aren’t going phenomenally. Seems to me like the war will be won through stamina and the more vested our interest the more likely the war continues and unrest in Russia grows. Zelensky has most of the world behind him because he’s defending his country, easier to bolster your side when so much is on the line. Russia’s just got Putin’s ego pushing them",Nyxaus_Motts,2025-05-02T12:18:00,3
"Quite a few bank and personal sanctions, apparently. Why these weren't implemented much earlier idk. We could also consider sanctioning the remaining European countries who are still buying Russian gas, which include Slovakia, France, Spain, Austria and Hungary. The EU's pledged to cut russian gas imports completely by 2027 but that's obviously not soon enough so we need to explore every option to twist their arms.",Alpine_Z28,2025-05-01T16:33:09,22
Cut off all the fuel that is being sold to Europe.,GentryMillMadMan,2025-05-01T17:48:08,9
"Why send your own troops when you don't have to? This really isn't that unusual. The fact they even have signing bonuses at all shows they are doing just fine. You are aware that the United States ALSO gives soldiers fairly substantial signing and re-enlistment bonuses, and we aren't even in an active conflict at the moment?  Just because they provide that isn't an evidence they are struggling.   Why did Russia use Wagner? Because, they were putting criminals and less desirables on the front lines as their meat shields instead. It keeps the citizens happy when less of their ""normal"" citizens are dying in war. This has been the NORM for literally ages.  Why did Germany partner with Japan in WW2? Was it because they ideologically believed that the Asian race was on par with the Aryan Germans? No, it was a strategic decision that leveraged them to be able to have multiple focuses and let others take the losses instead of them.",GeneticsGuy,2025-05-02T11:16:51,1
"The median average wage around me is 60k/yr. Infatryman bonus is 12k, or 20%. Wage is 28k/yr, or just under 50%.  Comparatively, Russia’s average wage is ~1mil rubles a month.  Average russian bonus (federal and regional combined) is 1.4mil rubles, or 140%. Average salary is approaching 2mil rubles, or 200%.  These numbers are not the same, especially considering the relative risk to life and limb.  As a Russian, the reason you may not want to have foreigners being a detachment of your army is multi-pronged. Increases logistical strain due to varying needs and training requirements. Language difficulties in fast moving situations. Also runs counter to Russia’s crafted portrayal of the war as a small, controlled, localized conflict (special military operation anyone?).  As far as the WW2 comparison, there was very little actual cooperation and certainly no mixing of the militaries (beyond a handful of dignitaries and stuff). Some similarities, but not a ton.",iowaisflat,2025-05-02T13:12:53,2
