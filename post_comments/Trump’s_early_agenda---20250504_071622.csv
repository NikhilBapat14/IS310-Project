Of course it does. He's a Confederate President. His agenda is to turn the United States into the Confederate States.,bin10pac,2025-05-04T07:27:07,43
"Dismantling civil rights was clearly the major plank of the MAGA platform (including P2025). They won by relying on the votes of the 32% of the country's 2024 voting-eligible population who actively supported preventing all ""others"" from achieving parity, in terms of rights, wealth, and privilege. But the real story is the 36% of the voting-eligible population whom they managed to persuade - either through disinformation or by promoting apathetic disgust - to just not vote at all. Recognizing those people's implicit ignorance about the tRump infection tells you both everything you need to know about why he was able to ""win"" but also about what has to be done to eradicate his malignant influence.",phosdick,2025-05-04T08:19:11,24
"This is fake news. I strongly believe in civil rights, that's why I'm bringing back colored bathrooms, water fountains, and housing. I'm going to make America great again and go back to a time when the Blacks and the Browns and the Reds and the Yellows all knew their place. White is right, White is might, there's good people on both sides and it's about time we return back to a time when everything was perfect.   /s",TopEagle4012,2025-05-04T07:57:41,10

"Many of us posted links to the actual website and the complete PDF of Project 2025 before the election, to jeers and downvotes. What is happening now reflects Project 2025 as an actual blueprint or guidebook for the current administration. Before the election, you could download it. Now, you have to buy it: *Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise*:  > This was a product of more than 100 organizations to prepare for a new conservative administration through policy, training, and personnel.  [From FactCheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/2024/09/a-guide-to-project-2025/) :  > Who funded and wrote Project 2025?  >The project is being led and funded by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative public policy think tank founded in 1973. In addition to Heritage, there are more than 100 conservative organizations on Project 2025’s advisory board. Among those “coalition partners” are the Center for Immigration Studies, Moms for Liberty, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, Tea Party Patriots, Turning Point USA and America First Legal Foundation, which is headed by Stephen Miller, a former Trump senior adviser.  >The project’s policy agenda was published online as a book titled “Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise.” The book has 30 chapters, each credited to one or more of its 35 primary authors and editors — although the final product includes input from “hundreds of contributors,” the project’s organizers said in a press release.  >It’s the ninth edition in the “Mandate for Leadership” series, the first of which was published in 1981, during the Reagan administration. According to its authors, earlier editions have had success in influencing government policies.  They had a plan and now they are implementing it.",R_Lennox,2025-05-04T12:30:54,5
"Project 2025 has been floating around for a while and it’s pretty clear what they want to do. If Trump gets another term, I wouldn’t expect any protections to stay in place unless there’s serious pushback. People need to pay attention to this stuff because it’s not just talk, they’re actually planning it out.",HugsCatcher,2025-05-04T09:15:39,2
"How and why can an executive order dismantle our fundamental rights? It makes zero sense, it’s absolutely an overreach and our systems not shutting this shit down is a complete failure.",astrozombie2012,2025-05-04T11:44:45,2

The media is very complicit in persuading most voters to not show up.  That and a general lack of critical thinking skills in most of the population.  It is frightening what some people believe to be actual truth.,IvankaPegsDaddy,2025-05-04T08:36:38,10
"why say ""including P2025?""  Trump is THEIR rubber stamp.  He does not give a rats ass about all of this stuff.  All he cares about is being in power and being seen as ""Dear Leader.""  The people behind P2025 are the authors of everything he has signed.  I truly do not think Trump even knows what's being placed on his desk, he just knows that he has to sign it, and doesn't care what it is.",2cigsaday,2025-05-04T13:25:17,2
