"I loved the obviously backhanded compliment Carney laid on trump for “revitalizing international security concerns”. Trump took it as a prideful compliment with a smile. Americans need to impeach trump, he is a joke.",One-Mind-Is-All,2025-05-06T19:02:15,18
"It's like talking to an insane child emperor in the 9th century or something.  Well done, Carney.  You did about as well as you could when faced with that group of incompetents.",pinetreesgreen,2025-05-06T18:54:30,15
"There was reporting that in a phone call, Carney told trump that if he didn't drop the 51st state rhetoric, he would dump ALL of Canada's US bonds and crash the dollar.  Crickets ever since.  Never stop resisting.",Oi_cnc,2025-05-06T19:00:28,14
He says this about everyone. Trump probably forgot who he was even talking to.  He's currently sitting there thinking about Putin.  ,arilupe,2025-05-06T18:52:52,2

I don’t think anyone thought that was a compliment other than trump. Lol,KennyMcKeee,2025-05-06T19:06:02,12
Trump has never stopped with the 51st state rhetoric. This is not true.,iamnobody19944,2025-05-06T19:13:29,-4
Carney was smooth with the slaps! Trump had no idea. I was impressed.,One-Mind-Is-All,2025-05-06T19:08:30,14
"He has, actually.  There has been no mention since the alleged phone call last week.",Oi_cnc,2025-05-06T19:21:31,3

"Yes right before Carney left. Last week is recent. I expect the orange buffoon has a lot of people to be a dick too, cant expect a comment everyday.   But yes Carney did say he asked Trump to cool off on the 51st state rhetoric. https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/video/9.6750343  Trump does seem to treat Carney with as much respect as his addled brain can muster",iamnobody19944,2025-05-06T19:25:42,0
That was obviously to help Pierre. He barely made any comments about Canada,iamnobody19944,2025-05-06T19:27:11,2

"This isnt worth arguing about. But alright, original comment said “…crickets ever since”, they were not talking about a pre election period where the Trump stopped for obvious reasons and then restarted.   I replied to that comment that trump hadnt really ever stopped. They said he had been quiet since the phone call last week. It is Tuesday today, i said it was recent enough.   You can agree with what i said or disagree.",iamnobody19944,2025-05-06T20:49:41,1
