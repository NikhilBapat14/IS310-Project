"We now have one quarter of negative GDP growth. A second one, April-June, is highly likely. At that point, we'll be officially in a recession. All Biden's fault of course.",Building_a_life,2025-05-01T11:54:11,21
There’s a lot of recession already locked in that will appear over the next year. We lost about 3% of growth in Trump’s first 100 days.,ranchoparksteve,2025-05-01T11:57:44,14
"Who the fuck could have known this?  The biggest economy that based on consumption and war economy being actually weak?  People spending money they don't have, on shit they do not need from could not be a solid base for an economy...",Shot_Independence274,2025-05-01T11:36:15,26
Nor do we have the leadership that can lead us out of trouble. Get ready everybody.,shelbys_foot,2025-05-01T11:30:15,9
"NO FUCKING SHIT.  A LOT OF US AREN’T BRAIN DEAD MORONS WITH THE MENTAL CAPACITIES OF A FIVE YEAR OLD.  But what do I know? My MAGA family continues to gaslight my ALL TIME LEVEL HIGHS OF DEPRESSION & ANXIETY as only “mental illness.”  Yes, I am mental ill, only because I HAVE BEEN SCREAMING ABOUT THIS FOR 2+ YEARS.   All while my parents continues to swallow the rotten carrot cock and his diseased loads.  It’s not hard to understand what is happening. I read Project 2025, IN IT’S ENTIRETY, in 2023. IT’S ALL IN THERE. Started following the money….Then, the movie “LEAVE THE WORLD BEHIND” came out.  I haven’t had a sound night of sleep since.   That movie was a warning to the entire world. Majority failed the test miserably, by being pissed at the ending. Not recognizing, EVERYTHING ELSE, sound familiar?  We are so fucked. Not decades, not years, not 9 months, not 5 months, not July, but RIGHT NOW.  I’m fairly broke, work my job, I have nothing to lose, like 99.5% of Americans. Call me crazy. Call me stupid. Call me mentally ill, I don’t care. I wanted to be a journalist, ended up in luxury hotels, working with some of the wealthiest people on this planet. Never stopped my thirst for knowledge. I’ve been doing nothing more than using my spare time to sift through all the bullshit, follow the money, and pay attention.   There is not a single “news” source out there telling ANY OF US/YOU—JUST HOW INCREDIBLY FUCKED WE ALL ARE.  Notice the silence of the “ultra wealthy” / “dems” on “America’s side” lately? They know exactly what’s coming and are finalizing their “escape plans” as I type  this.   Don’t believe me? Start watching their actions/money, not their words.   To the .001%, who control everything, we are and will never be anything but expendable.   Looking at you idiot millionaires who think you’re “so wealthy.” You’re the same as I am, absolutely NOTHING to these psychos. You might have 200 million, but we’re closer together—than you are to THEM.   I’ve worked multiple events with rooms that have individuals with combined net worths north of 200 billion dollars.   GET IT THROUGH YOUR FUCKING HEADS, WE MEAN ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO THESE “PEOPLE.”  The only chance we have, is ALL OF US vs THEM AND THEIR SORRY EXCUSES FOR WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A HUMAN.   I am not sure what do. I’ll keep trying to drill this into anyone willing to listen. Not like I can escape what’s coming.   Take care of yourselves. Help someone in need. Smile at that lonely person on the sidewalk. Hold a door. Write that “sorry” or “I love you” card. I can’t promise anything will be okay. What I can promise—if you do any of those things, you will always be a human being. We all have flaws. We all have strengths. Together, we are unstoppable—pitted against—we’re once again—NOTHING.",Patteyeson28,2025-05-01T13:22:53,9
"Oh, it's all a giant house of cards that has been propped up by multiple administrations following the 2008 crash. It's all smoke and mirrors, and eventually it's going to come crashing down. I am so here for it. ",Bakedads,2025-05-01T12:08:17,4
"I’m no expert but as far as I can tell every warning light is blinking red.  It reminds me of Dune where Piter talks about how Duke Leto was dead, he just didn’t know it yet as when you get pushed out of a window everything is fine until you hit the ground.  The impact of this tariff regime is already baked in and there’s no way to change that. It takes a few months for the supply chains to dry up but it’s already happening. If Trump changed his mind today and rescinded them all it wouldn’t matter. ",eskimospy212,2025-05-01T13:47:28,2

"Trump has been explaining this pretty clearly as much as he can. “Biden economy”, “wait”, “just around the corner”  He knows things are bad and heading worse, and he’s trying to get ahead of the problem.   The average American has been in, generally, good financial shape since 2012 or so. People thinking that things have been bad are going to be fuckin’ stunned when they actually turn bad, and they realize that the fake-bad they’ve been peddling was nonsense.   Talks about good times making weak men, Jesus. ",Useful_Violinist25,2025-05-01T12:00:23,18
You have to be pretty gullible to think Biden is the cause of the current grim economic outlook.  Anyone with at least half a functioning brain knows this is nothing to do with the *last* Democrat president. You need to look elsewhere for the blame. Thanks Obama.,Guapa1979,2025-05-01T12:49:44,5
Long term it's going to be good for us and the planet to get rid of this mirage of a strong economy and happy consumers. It's just going to be a really rough five to ten years to get there. Our market is artificially inflated specifically in tech share values. Eventually someone needs to actually check the worth of that stuff and they'll see it's not worth anything tangible. Which becomes a huge issue for people who used those holding assets to get cheap loans to buy more assets.,Possible_Proposal447,2025-05-01T11:47:37,5

I mean not as it should be and bad and really bad are all different things...  We're about to enter really bad.,FlyingRock,2025-05-01T12:06:19,4
"And that attitude, is exactly why we’re at where we are today.   Wishing you all the best!",Patteyeson28,2025-05-01T13:53:32,11
It’s just ludicrous how people complained about the Biden economy as bad or difficult. People are utterly clueless how good that was.,Useful_Violinist25,2025-05-01T12:59:29,5
Same to you. For real. :),grimmdrum,2025-05-01T13:56:27,-3
I mean it was good it was so good that it sucked people were still struggling..  This is going to be worse yes but too much of the good economy never made it back to the American people.. Hell even now it's going to suck because of one specific tariff battle with one specific country.,FlyingRock,2025-05-01T14:24:14,3
