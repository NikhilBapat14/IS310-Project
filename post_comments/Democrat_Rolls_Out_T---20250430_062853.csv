"Thanedar's political career is going down the toilet in Michigan. Filing impeachment charges is his desperate attempt to bring him some cred with the left, but he's an 'oligarch', so it ain't gonna happen.",social_dinosaur,2025-04-30T07:58:42,35
Was a time when the threat of impeachment was enough for a President to resign. (Nixon)  Now it’s just a petty political ploy to try and stay relevant.,swanspank,2025-04-30T08:18:12,39
"They've jumped the shark, as a party.  I don't have the exact date, but it's fun to watch",indefiniteretrieval,2025-04-30T07:18:19,43
Performative nonsense.  They don't have the votes or the support for it.,cathbadh,2025-04-30T09:25:02,20
They don't have any ideas - their whole game is to become the new Get Trump Guy and then roll it into a book deal and/or tv gig after the political game is over. Somebody will just step up immediately to be the next one anyway.,D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-30T12:25:24,5

"Politics is such a dirty business now.  In Nixon's time, at least there were norms where both sides would try to get along.  Now it's both sides trying to nuke each other.    I blame a lot of Chinese Communist Party  money going into various left wing and socialist political parties and empowers these groups to basically corrupt the US party politics.",GiediOne,2025-04-30T09:30:40,21

"He's disposable, so the Democrats let him do this stupid crap. Sort of like sacrificing Tim Walz on a doomed presidential ticket.",social_dinosaur,2025-05-02T06:54:44,1
