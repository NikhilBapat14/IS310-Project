"Is ""due process"" the new term Republican voters don't understand and can't be bothered to look up so they just start using it all the time?  So far we've got: communism, fascism, socialism, CRT, DEI, impeachment, and now *due process*.",CassadagaValley,2025-04-25T15:52:08,13
">The FBI arrested Nichols on Jan. 18, 2021. In November 2024, Nichols pleaded guilty to obstruction of an official proceeding and assaulting, resisting, or impeding certain officers, both of which are felony charges. He was sentenced to more than five years in prison and ordered to pay a hefty fine.  Has all the hallmarks of due process that I can tell.

You went before a judge. You plead guilty. That is exactly what due process looks like. You had the option of a jury trial. These deportees never had a chance to even see a judge. This man is an absolute moron.,No_Treat_4675,2025-04-25T16:52:28,5
"What a shitty story. More time should have been spent showing that this man who PLED GUILTY received due process, and these fkers just do not know what the term means.

Daily reminder that the House of Representatives is kind of a joke and the only thing that matters is who has the majority. Most of the individuals on both sides are just there to collect a check,Empty_Lemon_3939,2025-04-25T16:05:49,-2
