"You’re not good at this. Nowhere did I say anything about helping Trump, because I didn’t.  I also don’t agree that Trump made anything worse for Palestine. He’s a horrible person, but Israel’s actions have been consistent and always genocidal. US support has remained the same from Democrats to Republicans. Israel got weapons then and continue to now. Israel will do as Israel wants. Democrats didn’t defend Palestine then and Republicans won’t defend Palestine now. Both supported Israel in the only way they truly cared, militarily.  All I see in your post is a bunch of false accusations and strawmen. Why do you use strawmen? Are you here to discuss honestly? Because strawmen are dishonest by their very nature.  Say it with me, Israel is committing genocide. The sooner we all recognize the government carrying out the genocide, the sooner people of all political sides can come to together to say no more.

So I’ll edit this one instead, since I know there are no real issues for me posting.  As I said, first step is recognizing their actions for what they are. Ethnic cleansing, genocide, take your pick. Israel is an apartheid state and has been called out for this for a long time. Two of the largest humanitarian organizations have detailed reports on this from years ago. So the dehumanization aspect of Palestinians from Israel has been clear and it shouldn’t be such a hurdle to recognize the actions for what they are.  The US should have been verbally clear in their stance against Israel’s war crimes, but instead did the opposite and continually provided full verbal support for Israel and cover for their actions.  The US should have supported the international investigations into Israel’s actions. They did the opposite.  The US should have halted all weapon shipments.  The US should have gathered in support with other nations to speak out and take action against Israel’s war crimes in a firm manner that connected to actual actions for non-compliance.

The use of resource deprivation, including food, energy, and water, was also a fairly standard tactic of the nazis. Targeting press, first responders, doctors and hospitals, etc, that is an Israeli innovation. The recent Massacre of first responders, where the IDF attempted to cover up the execution style murders of those ambulance and fire personnel by crushing their vehicles and burying them and their vehicles, only came out because the IDF didn't realize the murders were being recorded on somebody's phone, and they didn't find the phone because they didn't know to look for it.

Concessions that it's pretty clear Israel is not prepared to make. At least not under Netanyahu.

"A warrant issued for an arrest of a criminal would work on an ordinary criminal but Netanyahu is not only a war criminal he’s also the head of state which cannot be arrested because no international governing body has that power. If netanyahu were impeached, tried in Israel then extradited to the ICC assuming that Israel is a member then yes issue the warrant and arrest him. Unfortunately until he leaves office he's never going to face justice. Second any negotiations involving a ceasefire and a peace deal would most likely take place in a neutral third party nation and if that country  is a member of the ICC then they would be obligated to extradite him making it unlikely for such a deal to made in the first place. Finally lets say for some reason they arrest Netanyahu right now. Whose the leader left to negotiate. Here’s the thing when you capture the head of state there is no leader to negotiate with because they’re in prison and any leader selected during the power vacuum would lack legitimacy because the imprisoned leader never resigned/impeached.
