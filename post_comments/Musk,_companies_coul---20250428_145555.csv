"He deserves major time for this, like life in Supermax prison. Not just for essentially stealing 2 billion from the taxpayers, but also giving himself countless contracts for even more money and doing harm to our critical institutions that will leave them compromised and in shambles for generations.",RealGianath,2025-04-28T15:01:37,17

"Musk is too clever by half. Yes, he may change the rules to cover things up but as everyone knows the cover-up is worse than the crime. Liability from Musk's meddling may reach uncaculable heights if an independent judicary ever looks at it.",SeenItAllHeardItAll,2025-04-28T15:53:05,2

"You don’t go to super max for white collar crime, fraud, and theft tho.   What he deserves is to lose all his money and half to live on US minimum wage with the majority of his earnings garnished to pay back his debts. Being broke will destroy him, being imprisoned will let him convince himself he’s the victim.",Macqt,2025-04-28T16:30:45,3

I doubt it. Trump only promises. Never pays. Musk may end up like Giuliani.,bob-loblaw-esq,2025-04-28T23:05:38,1
