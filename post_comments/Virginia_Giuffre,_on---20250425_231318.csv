"The last few months of her life she saw the biggest sexual predator in the world, the man who bragged about grabbing the genitals of girls like her simply because he could, she saw that man become the most powerful person on the planet.¬†   I can only imagine what the world looked like to her. It makes me so angry.   What's going to make me angrier is that she's probably just the first. The only one that we're going to see in the news. How many women were abused by Trump only to see him where he is now?¬†",5050Clown,2025-04-25T23:41:31,181

"I mean this is one of the rare cases where the conspiracists have some evidence on their side.

"Based on her social media posts over the past few weeks, she was very very mentally unwell. She just lost custody of her kids, getting divorced, was just in a car accident where she (or the car she was in?) was hit by a bus.  She was publicly crashing out on social media and posted she only had three days to live after the car accident. Despair over the situation with her kids.  Survivors of sexual abuse have a higher risk of mental illnesses and suicide. Add her early traumas to the recent marriage and custody issues and car accident, along with the stress over trials. It's easy to see how she could have been overwhelmed with despair. That post about her kids was heartbreaking.  Eta: my details a bit off. From an article:  *Last month Virginia posted a photo, showing her lying on a hospital bed covered in bruises, along with her statement that she had ""four days to live"" caused the same amount of shock. Police said there had been only a ""minor crash"" with no reports of serious injuries, while sources close to Virginia said her post had been a ""mistake"".  The sex abuse survivor reportedly recently split from her husband of two decades, Robert Giuffre, and became estranged from their three teenage children - two sons and a daughter. Until recently, the family had been living an idyllic and quiet life in a ¬£1 million seaside six-bedroomed home in Ocean Reef, Perth.*",LowFloor5208,2025-04-26T14:44:55,5

"Yeah, the cropping is dumb. But it's still evidence that at some point in the past she was somewhat worried about the possibility of assassination, and not worth totally ignoring.  There is enough evidence to be at least somewhat suspicious. I'm gonna sound like a nut, but the recent crash is just objectively weird. Stuff doesn't add up in what she said and the police report.

People should share evidence in context, with dates attached, but still I don't think it's disrespectful to her to suspect foul play.  I mean hell absolute worst case there's more public pressure on the island people, I don't think she would have been wildly upset.",Sharp_Champion5006,2025-04-27T13:15:46,3
