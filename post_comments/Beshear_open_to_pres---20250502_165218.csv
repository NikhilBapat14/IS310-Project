"I have always supported the hell out of this man and I think he would be EXCELLENT. Tim Walz would also be fantastic. If anyone can get us out of this mess, it's one of them.",Frickin_Brat,2025-05-02T17:39:05,44

"He's got my vote and full support in the 2028 primary. IDGAF what anyone says, sure he's not a firey mic dropper like an AOC, but he has so many great qualities. Young, good looking, charming, Governor of a ruby red state, knows how to talk to voters the Democratic party struggles with, doesn't have the establishment stink on him or the coastal elite stereotype. Also he knows how to make politics simple and digestible, and meets voters where they are at  I absolutely love this dude and he would be the first guy I've ever heavily rallied around in a presidential primary in all seriousness.  I know he's an extremely polarizing figure for obvious reasons not arguing against any of them, but Andy Beshear has a lot of Bill Clinton like qualities (the good ones). He really does feel like a Jimmy Carter Bill Clinton type.  My dream ticket for 2028 is him with Ruben Gallegos, Reverend Warnock, JB Prtizker etc. This ticket feels like my only hope during these very dark times.",Shadow_Strike99,2025-05-02T17:21:44,13
He would be a very good candidate,NEKORANDOMDOTCOM,2025-05-02T16:58:25,6
We need to be honest here - Dems HAVE to run a straight white male ticket in 28. That's just the way it is.  Beshear / Kelly 2028,Banned_Opinions,2025-05-02T18:45:23,12
He would win,dukefan15,2025-05-02T18:38:11,3

"Yeah this one can be filed in the ""no surprise"" folder.  He's out as governor in January 2027. The timing couldn't be more perfect.  I think he's got a good shot. The primaries starting in SC is going to be very favorable towards southern candidates, especially those who have experience ""campaigning"" in black church basements. They're the core of the Democratic Party there. Winning southern Democratic primaries takes a very different style and different kind of politics. You've gotta connect with voters on an emotional level, like Biden did and like Obama did. That's going to make things considerably tougher for candidates like Buttigieg, Walz, and even Shapiro. Especially Pete, since he's so wonky and technocratic. That plays well with white liberals, but it falls flat as rock with black voters (generally speaking). His campaign tanked in SC last time.  Former NC Gov. Roy Cooper is another one I'd keep an eye on. His state borders and shares media markets with SC. He's got general election kudos, too. Twice-elected in a hefty swing state that would allow us to lose a blue wall state. That would be an enormous advantage in a general election.",KR1735,2025-05-02T22:26:18,4

Fiery mic dropping will win. Fiery rhetoric is what will get attention. Quiet charm won't do a thing. Trump has proven that. Jimmy Carter / Clinton would lose in today's races.,errie_tholluxe,2025-05-02T18:59:27,1

">Former NC Gov. Roy Cooper is another one I'd keep an eye on  He is the perfect VP, regardless of who wins the nomination. He's in a critical swing state and not a sitting Senator (i.e. Mark Kelly), so his election wouldn't effect the margins.",maybemorningstar69,2025-05-03T13:20:02,3
"Independents are a growing political demographic so a winning ticket definitely needs them, that said Republicans who voted for Trump three times are pretty unlikely to flip, so I hear you there.  That said, is not about supporting ""whoever is the nominee"", its about picking the right nominee.

"I would argue that his debate preformance against Vance is a particularly poor representation of the man, as was his time as VP nominee.    I remember reading that folks on the Harris campaign told him to tone himself down throughout the campaign, but if you look at his time as Minnesota governor the man is capable of being aggressive (in the political sense) in the way described. His debates as governor aren't perfect, but he's far more alert and on the attack. Whereas his preformance against Vance was coached by Pete Buttigieg with the express purpose of making him look ""nice.""",10TurtlesAllTheWay10,2025-05-03T06:37:26,2

"I actually agree with you that he’s not the *type* of “go-getter” we need as a party right now. However Beshear is an excellent debater. He usually mops the floor with his opponents in debates…but his opponents have been Daniel Cameron (admittedly does okay in debates) and…Matt Bevin, who is up there among the biggest dumbasses to ever lead KY.   Andy is my governor, and I love him as that. But I just don’t think he has what it takes to compete on a national level, as much as I hate to say it.",bassocontinubow,2025-05-03T06:42:06,2

"Idk about that really. I don’t think you can honestly say that a black woman is ever a “safe pick” in the eyes of America. I actually think Biden took an enormous risk in picking Harris. I’m really glad he did it, but it had me nervous for sure.",bassocontinubow,2025-05-03T06:46:29,1
"Of the options he considered (Kamala Harris, Susan Rice, Karen Bass, Keisha Lance-Bottoms, etc), Harris was *by far* the safest pick. Further, when Biden dropped out in July and Harris was given an open path to take the nomination, she was again the safest pick for the nomination, by far.  Tim Walz put it best recently, Democrats need to stop playing it safe.",maybemorningstar69,2025-05-03T13:18:39,1
