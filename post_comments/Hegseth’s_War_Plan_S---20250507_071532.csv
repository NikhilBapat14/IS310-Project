">The incident happened the same day President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire deal with the Houthis, the Iran-backed rebel group that the Truman‚Äôs crew has been battling in Yemen.  >Hours after Trump‚Äôs announcement, the Houthis ‚Äútook a shot‚Äù at the aircraft carrier, a source told CNN. It wasn‚Äôt immediately clear whether the shooting was related to the lost fighter jet, an F/A-18F Super Hornet fighter jet worth about $67 million.  >It was the second jet to go overboard the Truman in as many weeks.  >On April 28, an F/A-18E Super Hornet was lost after the aircraft carrier swerved to avoid an attack from the Houthis. The plane was being towed in the hangar bay, and the move crew lost control of the aircraft, the Navy said in a statement. The tow tractor also went overboard, according to the statement.  >A third fighter jet was accidentally shot down over the Red Sea in December by another Navy warship, the USS Gettysburg, raising questions about how well warships and fighter jets in the region are communicating, the Post reported.  >And in February, the Truman collided with a merchant vessel near Port Said, Egypt, in the Mediterranean Sea, according to the Navy. There were no reports of flooding or injuries, but the ship‚Äôs commanding officer were fired following the incident, according to the Post.  >The dangerous mishaps have raised questions about the Truman‚Äôs grueling deployment, which Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has extended twice, the paper reported.

"This.  Hegseth is directly culpable.   Carriers are living assets that have a life cycle - fresh from refurbishment crew training/shakedown, fully ready deployment, and in-port modernization/refurbishment.  Each step takes about two years.    By extending the fully ready deployment of the ship he‚Äôs pushed the ship and crew into the exhausted zone.  There is both organizational and material danger in this zone.    Crew that were focused by the excitement of going to do something real are not able to maintain that focus forever.  As anyone with carrier experience will tell you, complacency and tedium lead to loss of focus.  Those create catastrophic accidents that get people killed and equipment damaged.  This malaise may have contributed to the first aircraft falling overboard.   And it‚Äôs not just psychological.  Some shipboard equipment can only be repaired/refurbished in port.  The arresting gear may have malfunctioned and caused the second jet to splash into the sea.    Hegseth made a big deal about uniforms looking sharp.
