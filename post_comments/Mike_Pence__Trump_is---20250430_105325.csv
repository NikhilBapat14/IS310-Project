"Have y'all noticed that Pence didn't get punted around to all these weird places like Vance does?

Mike Pence? Mike Pence as in former Vice President Mike Pence? Mike Pence of “Hang Mike Pence!” fame? Maybe that guy should just shut the fuck up. Just my opinion.,heismanwinner82,2025-04-30T11:00:34,8

"Mike Pence has written words of advice to his former boss President Trump, urging him to return to traditional conservative values, abandon trade tariffs and support Ukraine in its war with Russia or risk jeopardising America’s future.  Pence, who was Trump’s vice-president between 2017 and 2021, lauded his return to the White House as “a political comeback unrivalled in modern American history” but said a number of his policy decisions were a departure from what had made the US prosperous during his first term.  He wrote in The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday that he welcomed Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration and cheered anticipated rises in military spending, which are expected to take the Pentagon’s budget over $1 trillion for the first time.  “Our country has corrected course in many ways, but the results are undeniably mixed,” Pence said, adding that the “economic warning signs are flashing. The first quarter of 2025 marked the second-worst economic start for a presidential administration since Richard Nixon",TimesandSundayTimes,2025-04-30T10:53:59,2

Vance is delivering the threats.,mymomknowsyourmom,2025-04-30T11:03:00,13
"Vance is there in case the magats finally actually turn on Trump so Thiel and Vought can continue their work. Americans are really good at blaming just one name for a whole administrations worth of bullshit, we really really like having a patsy to point at instead of having to remember all the actual shitheads.  As the full economic ramifications of not only the tariffs but also the direct loss of a ridiculous amount of soft power begin to hit it is likely the Trump name falls off the map majorly, though they are odds he has beaten before. Vance is just an insurance package, a useful tool that can have his personal morals easily bent.",TheGreatHornedRat,2025-04-30T11:53:19,7

Mike Pence is sharing his recipe for a Milquetoast Sandwich: indirect criticism of something Trump is directly at fault for sandwiched between Obama criticism and praise for Trump.  His vapidity and cravenness are how he managed the feat of becoming loathed on both sides of the political spectrum.,Probable_Bison,2025-04-30T11:13:07,2
