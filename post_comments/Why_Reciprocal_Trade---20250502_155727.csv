"In a piece for the *Civitas Outlook*, [Richard Epstein](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/richard-epstein) lays out his case for why the Trump administration’s current trade negotiation strategy will not succeed. Epstein’s argument centers on the importance of multinational specialization in complex modern supply chains. He maintains that “in the vast number of cases, these two-party deals only increase the losses on both sides of the table,” as much international trade is multiparty. Simply put, countries tend not to have purely reciprocal trade relationships, but rather a complex reliance on imports from some nations and exports to others. Epstein argues that this is why the World Trade Organization has proven to be such a successful model; its multilateral agreements consider the nonreciprocal complexity of international trade and complex supply chains. Epstein encourages the Trump administration to drop its insistence on bilateral reciprocity in upcoming trade talks. ",HooverInstitution,2025-05-02T15:57:45,2
