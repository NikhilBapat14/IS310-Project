"By Hugh Cameron - U.S. News Reporter:   President Donald Trump has threatened to place a 100 percent tariff on Barbie maker Mattel, after the company's CEO said it would continue to manufacture outside the U.S. but would be reducing its reliance on Chinese imports.  ""I've heard \[Mattel\] said: 'Well we're going to go counter, we're going to try going someplace else,'"" Trump said in the Oval Office on Thursday. ""That's OK, let him go, and we'll put a 100 percent tariff on his toys, and he won't sell one toy in the United States, and that's their biggest market.""

"The tariffs on materials used for making the toys are causing prices to go up to high to the point Mattel and other toy manufacturers can't make it work and Trump is blowing it off as not that serious. Here's the thing, the reason he's blowing it off is because this isn't hitting toys harder than other things, every industry is begging for exceptions and they can't just hand them out without getting into legal battles over favoritism toward some corporations and not others. The tech industry is being devastated too. Nexus Gaming did a huge deep dive into PC builders and PC part manufacturers and it's completely unworkable. Motherboards have thousands of little parts and many of them can't be produced in the US so they are being priced out of making any for the US at all or they take a $90 loss per board on a $120 board. They even talked to one company that builds everything in the US but they can't cope either because to many materials and parts have to come from outside of the US. There's no winning. PCs are going to skyrocket in price or they just won't be sold in the US if the tariffs remains. Clothing manufacturers are suffering too. They can't currently make money the way it is either. The US simply does not have material manufacturing to replace China. You literally can't source materials from the US. You could build the factories here but that would take years and also would drive the price of materials through the roof because of US wages vs Chinese wages. Trump is just forcing companies to go bankrupt or sell outside of the US to stay alive.",AtraposJM,2025-05-09T11:59:38,1

"Here's an interesting thing about this:  WWE, who largely support Trump, including the former CEO, and current Secretary of Education Linda McMahon and her family, have a deal with Mattel to make their action figures and toys.  I'm curious how WWE/TKO would appreciate losing all of this money on merchandise. I'm sure it's not a huge amount of their revenue, but anyone can attest to how many ads have been shoved into the current product, which is not *the* reason I stopped watching, but certainly a factor.   However, it's clear that they're trying to milk the WWE machine of as much money as possible, so I'm betting they're not too happy about losing a few million per year because of Trump's pettiness.

"He's literally so stupid he thinks in order to make money you need to sell something to someone else, so it's the same for countries, right? Only way to become rich is to sell more stuff than you buy. It's a child's understanding of macroeconomics.   Any activity that causes productivity to increase will increase the country's wealth including stuff that happens completely internally. A country could grow its economy with no trade or it could do it by literally only buying things. As long as it is buying things it needs to increase its productive output, they will become richer. For example a country that buys mining equipment and exploits its natural resources now has all those resources. Did they lose out because they only bought something? Of course not. Also not everything these days is a physical product. Services are huge and can be bought and sold across borders. Basically for a million reasons how the economy actually works is much more complicated than ""sell stuff to foreigners, get rich"". Like you said we buy a lot of stuff because that is the main perk of being rich. It's a sign of our success, and Trump wants to take it away from people.   Thing is, Trump may be stupid, but not everyone in his his circle is stupid. Not literally every republican is stupid, and yet they are going along with this. Why? Because Trump's stupid explanation for these sorts of things is the sort of stupid explanation that is meant to pull the wool over the eyes of voters. They're supposed to go ""yeah, that makes sense, gotta sell stuff to become rich"".   The real reasons for the tariffs are twofold. Firstly it's a way for the rich to implement a regressive sales tax that is hidden in the cost of goods, allowing them to give themselves another tax cut while increasing the tax burden on everyone else. Typical class warfare from the 1%. The second reason is they want to shake down smaller countries that are dependent upon trade with the US. They think, what's the point of having all this economic clout with your consumers being a huge market to these people if you don't use that clout to shake them down? Typical rich psychopath shit, and an extension of the 1%'s class warfare to a global stage.   We need to stop these criminals in their tracks.

"While Trump clearly doesn't get this, having listened to several economists explaining the trade deficit issue, there are problems there.   What I got as a takeaway is that a trade deficit is usually balanced out by some form of investment.   Treasuries are issues and the government is supposed to use that for infrastructure, jobs, etc.   Instead we keep raising the debt ceiling but putting that debt into tax cuts, overblown military spending, and other wasteful things.   Essentially we are spending as if we have a low interest credit card, but without improving GDP at the same time we are going to be screwed in the long run.   That debt is also owned largely by foreign countries. If they were to sell off their treasuries the market for them could collapse and cause a global financial crisis.   In fact the reason Trump backed off on tarrifs with a 90 day pause is that the treasury market was on the verge of that crisis when someone dumped a ton of them all at once. They hadn't figured out who when I heard the last piece, but it was likely China flexing in the face of Trump's tarrifs.

"Your example does not accurately reflect what a trade deficit is. You're only outlining one side of the trading. A trade deficit is when a country imports more than it exports. What you're describing is a simple sale of a product.  It's more like you're selling lawnmowers to a landscaping company, but also buying services from that same landscaping company. You sell $10k worth of lawnmowers to the landscaping company each year, but they sell you $5k worth of landscaping services each year. This is a trade deficit - one party is selling more to the other party.  This isn't inherently a bad thing. There can be problems with large trade deficits that are sustained for long periods of time, but it's not necessarily a problem just because a trade deficit exists.",RandyHoward,2025-05-09T11:59:03,1

But no, the DNC thought calling the alt-right fascists ""weird"" was too much and put a leash on Harris/Walz so they stayed in line. It's even more obvious now after the election when you see how Walz is acting now that he doesn't have the DNC over his shoulder. I've seen next to nothing from Harris since January, so either she's staying quiet for her own safety, or she doesn't care about what's going on, and frankly I'm sure it's both.

Polls say it's because people don't think Democrats fight hard enough, that they vote blue no matter who and yet corporatocracy is all the same. Because Democrats have found their willing election strategy to be Not Republican and their platform becomes less and less progressive each year.   Messaging was awful and her campaign advisers sabotaged her campaign. What's a better campaign? Tax breaks for black owned small businesses or tax billionaires?

The old guard Dems are complicit in all of this. There are some Dems in DC who really do care about the people and stopping the fascist coup, but they're a small minority in their own party. If we want real change, we need to get rid of the geriatric fuckers like Schumer and Pelosi who are just there to get richer, and vote in politicians who have a track record of wanting to fight for the people.
