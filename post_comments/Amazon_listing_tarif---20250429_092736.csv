But I thought tariff was the most beautiful word in the entire world and everyone would love them.  Enjoy your tariffs maga voters 🤡,Snakesandrats,2025-04-29T09:40:05,13
"Anyone that doesn't align with them 100% is engaging in a ""hostile and political act"" according to them. They have gone completely insane.",inthekeyofc,2025-04-29T09:33:54,12
I support this. But also fuck both of them.,thistimelineisweird,2025-04-29T09:30:54,20

"This is a great example of how people wrongly think proximity to power will protect them from Fascists, Bezos killed WAPO criticisms of Trump and their endorsement of Harris, he changed their editorial rules to restrict criticism of Trumps billionaire class backers, now they’re explaining how the tariffs are the literal cost of Trumps actions and they’re being threatened for “stepping out of line”    Fascists will always weaponize power, whenever and wherever they can, being close to power (white enough, rich enough, MAGA enough) will not keep you safe. ",WhiteMorphious,2025-04-29T09:47:10,6

The tariffs are a hostile and political act.,symphonicrox,2025-04-29T09:45:43,3
Dictators hate it when anyone states a fact: they see it as political.,Still_Mix3277,2025-04-29T09:52:04,3
"Let this be a loud and clear message to the viewers of this story: Our oligarchs though extremely wealthy... Are dumbasses when it comes to politics. They let their fortunes get in then way of clear thinking.   All of us public high school graduates could have told Bezos this was going to happen. We all knew that Trump did not care about anyone else. Yet... These so called ""brilliant minds"" could not see it. The smell of piles of cash coming their way clouded their common sense.   So let me offer this modified piece from a timely read about 1930's Germany:  ""...Then they came for the oligarchs... But still I did not care... Because I was not one of them...""",williamgman,2025-04-29T09:55:28,3
God forbid the customer know what they're paying before they click yes. Don't make me defend bezos you orange orangutan of a president.,ClassicHando,2025-04-29T10:30:22,3
 Basically a Trump “I did that” sticker. Brick and mortar stores should do that too,hyborians,2025-04-29T09:50:53,2
Huh  Doesn’t that mean that tariffs are a “hostile and political act”?,DmAc724,2025-04-29T09:51:04,2

wait is Bezos allowed to defy Trump like this  fuck all these broligarhy guys,MichaelPFrancesa,2025-04-29T09:48:25,1
How is it hostile. I think it’s transparent…,QuirkyWish3081,2025-04-29T10:17:30,1
"Coming soon (probably): ""Amazon and other retailers engaging in this practice must reverse course on this dangerous and hostile act towards the regime or be considered enemies of the state and face punishment.""",mkt853,2025-04-29T10:31:48,1

I read this as Jeff Bezos withdrawing his support from Trump. He sees a future where he's prosecuted in a totalitarian regime.,DevinGraysonShirk,2025-04-29T09:32:40,13

"I wondered how long it'd take the billionaire / technocrat class to turn on Trump. He has so many hard policies that are the opposite of what would benefit them (see: tariffs, etc.).  At the end of the day Trump is balancing being a tyrant and pleasing those who bought his Presidency. It's only a matter of time before they turn on him, get enough support, and oust him for Vance who they put in place as his VP.",thistimelineisweird,2025-04-29T09:36:52,7

">It's only a matter of time before they turn on him  632 more days would be my guess.  That makes it January 21st 2027, the first day JD can serve both the rest of Trumps term and 2 full terms of his own.  Plenty of time to slowly get the cult to realize Trumps mentally declining, but Vance is his ""heir"" to the original things MAGA was promised.  The only real question is will they use the 25th or has someone scheduled Trump for an ""accident"".",VanguardAvenger,2025-04-29T10:00:13,2
"I predict they'll use Section 4 of the 25th Amendment, and blame it on cognitive decline. If this happens, it'll happen by the end of July at the latest.",DevinGraysonShirk,2025-04-29T09:43:29,1
I think that was the original intent before his policies were even more terrible than they wanted.,thistimelineisweird,2025-04-29T10:40:39,1
"I am convinced that was the original plan with Pence.  Trump is a Trojan Horse.  If the technocrats want to take control with Vance, they need to act fast.  The world economy and their fortunes won't survive another 532 days of this.  Vance could never be elected on his own, he has the charisma of a rusty nail.  The technocrats don't need him to lead, they just want to replace Putin's puppet with their own.",Caraes_Naur,2025-04-29T10:52:34,1
"It has always felt like they were going to ride the Trump coattails, remove him, install Vance, try and blow his crazy over. But I think they're also terrified of his cult, so we'll see.",thistimelineisweird,2025-04-29T09:50:11,1
