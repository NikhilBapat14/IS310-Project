">""Whether it's his plan or not""  Excellent work identifying the breadcrumbs on this one, LA Times! It must have been challenging to put the pieces of this picture together... I mean, it's only been broadcast by MAGA since well before the election that this was the gameplan. But then, Trump did say he had ""nothing to do with it"", so it's good you took him at his word and didn't press him on this back before all of this started.",dietTAB,2025-05-09T15:37:25,28
"Not ""whether""   Its his plan, it was always his plan, his ex and current staffers literally wrote the book and plan for if Trump won in 2024   He lied, and trash MSM titles like this made people believe his lies",blues111,2025-05-09T15:38:49,10
"Looks like the enablers in the administration are running a full speed power grab, using the president as their battering ram. They‚Äôre gunning for firing federal workers without oversight, kicking up deportations, stripping LGBTQ rights, trashing environmental protections, and gutting agencies n basically, turning the government into their playground. Time to start identifying these power hungry insiders, because they‚Äôre banking on pardons and political cover forever. But nothing lasts forever.",prajwas2004,2025-05-09T15:33:51,6
"This has literally always been the plan. Just because he herpaderped his way through the campaign saying things like, ""Project 2025? I don't know her,"" doesn't mean shit. The dude lies and Project 2025 is the goal of the people who put him back in the presidency so he can fart around pretending to be a king.  I hate it here.",emslynn,2025-05-09T15:40:44,3
What is this soft ass title? It‚Äôs the plan. It‚Äôs clearly the plan,Unlikely_Ant_950,2025-05-09T17:37:15,3

Why is that even a question? Every presidential order is a page from 2025,techcore2023,2025-05-10T14:55:54,1
My thoughts exactly. If you even briefly skim over it it's obvious they are following it as closely as possible and that some of the executive orders were basically pages torn out of it. Nobody didn't know this by now.,Bruce-7891,2025-05-09T15:41:57,6
"LA Times:  ""It's obvious that we are seeing smoke, and where there's smoke, there's usually fire. But we can't for sure say there's fire here... and even if we did see the fire, it would be journalistically inappropriate to identify the fire as such, lest we be branded 'biased' by the fascists who operate exclusively in bad faith.""",dietTAB,2025-05-09T15:42:23,9
What even was his strategy behind denying any connection to it? Just to pretend that these were all his ideas and his work?,Bruce-7891,2025-05-09T15:43:27,1
"To be fair, he might legitimately not know what Project 2025 is. He's basically a figurehead for the people behind him, signing whatever comes across his desk. Hell, it came out yesterday that one of his Truth Social posts (announcing a crypto reserve fund in the federal government) was directly written by a crypto lobbyist and sent to Trump for posting, and the lobbyist snuck in a mention of XRP/Ripple, a cryptocurrency that his client issues, and Trump didn't even realize it until days later.",platinumarks,2025-05-09T16:14:29,1
"And if the Dems ever get power back and decide to do the whole Obama/Biden ""we look forward not backwards"" bull$hit we will be right back here soon enough. Liberal democracies are ill-equipped to handle true existential threats.",mkt853,2025-05-09T16:05:34,4
"Yet the ""most respected"" news journalism organizations in the country are seemingly still scratching their heads.  ""Could a spade be a spade? We just don't know for sure. Was Trump being dishonest when he downplayed P2025? Again, not sure... and even now, when his admin's entire M.O. is implementing sweeping portions of P2025, all we can do is merely speculate vaguely, because there's simply no way to dig any deeper on this.""",dietTAB,2025-05-09T15:47:00,3
Kind of like whether Trump is working for the Russians. I mean just because he routinely puts Russian interest before U.S interests is not reason to think so.,econoquist,2025-05-09T22:25:47,1
"It polled terribly with Americans as a whole last year at like 70% against so he realized he had to distance himself from the concept or else risk losing the election by releasing a different document called ""Agenda 47"" to say ""OH no this is actually my plan not project 2025""  We all said it was bullshit on the left, and mainstream media pretty much sanewashed it and helped Trump distance away from it by reporting the idea it wasnt his plan",blues111,2025-05-09T15:47:03,3
"It's like how people on the right HATE ""Obamacare,"" but when you poll individual provisions of the ACA, the majority of them poll positively. It's only when you tell them that Obama was involved that they suddenly hate everything about it.  The reality is, a significant percentage of the right loathes immigrants, trans people, ""DEI hires,"" and basically anyone who isn't a White cis man who wears MAGA hats. Capitalism screws everyone equally, but these people have become convinced that the boot holding them down isn't pushing down other people enough, rather than that the boot shouldn't exist at all.",platinumarks,2025-05-09T16:08:07,4
"""It polled terribly with Americans as a whole last year at like 70% against""  It is sort of comforting to know most people are still sane when presented with an issue without the political tribe mentality to vote a specific way. It's sad how many people will throw logic reasoning and decency out the window based on which side is behind the idea.",Bruce-7891,2025-05-09T15:57:14,1
