">Target  >Yes, even Target ditched its DEI and got targeted by the Left's boycotts.  >1.5% growth with total revenue of $30.92 billion. Foot traffic also increased 1.4% despite stories from left-wing outlets that cited lack of traffic as evidence that the boycott was working.  You don't realize the unabashed joy this particular one gives me.",squunkyumas,2025-05-06T12:11:56,188
"Appart from tesla, was anything really boycotted?",Dutchtdk,2025-05-06T13:31:22,33
"One aspect this article does not go into is that in many, many places in the US Target, Walmart, etc may be your only option for buying affordable goods. With prices still being pretty high, everyone is tightening their belts. Personally I would prefer to shop elsewhere, but Walmart offers the best prices for cleaning supplies and most of toiletries we use in our house. There just aren’t many options near me, the next biggest shopping area is two hours away.",According_To_Me,2025-05-06T13:28:02,37

This isn’t really a surprise. The woke mob is broke. Producers with discretionary income would never support socialism.  I make it a point to patronize non-woke businesses and businesses targeted by the woke mob. I don’t travel to states that don’t recognize my concealed carry permit. It matters!,rdenghel,2025-05-06T12:45:43,20
Some companies just renamed their DEI programs.,NotThatGuyAnother1,2025-05-06T13:40:44,10
Businesses need to realize the left doesn't patronize their stores to begin with so a boycott ain't changing nothing.   Hard to be shopping when you're jobless and broke and have a ton of student debt.,StayStrong888,2025-05-06T20:40:45,3
Oh i remember the articles over the past months telling me that Target foot traffic was down and that the boycott was working....as usual complete rubbish.,Merax75,2025-05-06T21:39:19,2

The left is resorting to childish tactics like grabbing a full cart of stuff then leaving it with the cashier after lecturing the cashier why they won't buy from Target. They get all giddy afterwards saying they wasted their time and now they have to put everything back.   That's the level they are at.,StayStrong888,2025-05-06T20:39:07,29
I'd hazard a guess the people are boycotting Tesla because there's a giant group of people out there going around freaking burning them. Not because people don't want to do business with them.,TheThunderOfYourLife,2025-05-06T13:47:01,42
"They boycotts lasted for 1 day at a time, but they stocked up at said the boycotted stores before and after...so in effect, no.",LawsOfWoo,2025-05-06T13:40:01,17
I remember people were boycotting Amazon.,Trondkjo,2025-05-06T14:07:23,1
"Actually yeah it’s pretty bad for Tesla, especially in Europe where sales are down 30-80% yoy depending on country.",Zachmode,2025-05-06T12:56:46,59
"As a Tesla stock holder, it’s been a tougher year than others since I started investing right before quarantine began. At the start of 2024, each share was about $400. Right now, it’s about $273. Overall though I’m still up from when I initially purchased it in 2020.",According_To_Me,2025-05-06T13:22:39,15

"Who is they. A mass movement or 20 people on social media?   I feel like ""they"" are often blown out of proportion.   And I firmly believe most of us are a lot closer to each other than we're led to believe",Dutchtdk,2025-05-06T13:43:25,33

Or not paying for it and stealing it bc that’s what progressives do,Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-05-07T07:56:14,3
"Didn't catch their names.  But yeah, I don't think it amounted to much, a bunch of social media posts with a few hundred responses. There were some local protests at Walmart/target, but again nothing big.",LawsOfWoo,2025-05-06T15:00:15,4
