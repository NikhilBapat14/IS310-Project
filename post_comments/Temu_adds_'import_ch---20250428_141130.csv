Now do people who arenâ€™t drop shippers or simply do private labeling.  Tariffs arenâ€™t only hitting those people. Itâ€™s fucking over every small business owner or companies that donâ€™t have stockpiles and canâ€™t weather the couple months of uncertainty - Temu doing this is just an indicator.   And these corporations will scoop the marketshare after the dust settles.,Yourmotherssonsfatha,2025-04-28T15:42:48,13
"But not the best either- my friends used Temu for shipping supplies and components. (Molds, labels, etc) They may close their soap business now even though they make all the soaps here.  Edit to add: I donâ€™t know enough about Temu to have a strong opinion, I just know what she was telling me earlier about how it impacts her. I always considered her shop fully domestic- but I guess supplies come from all over even for small local shops like hers.",NotYourGa1Friday,2025-04-28T17:53:00,2
Lol. On one hand if someone was making decent bank doing that I wouldn't knock them. On the other hand that's not a sound thought out investment and life plan so I don't feel bad for them.,maninthewoodsdude,2025-04-28T14:58:08,0

"Your other hand isn't a particularly great one, many investments that have improved our world over the centuries originally weren't soundly thought out investments or life plans.   The reason to not feel bad for them is because they largely made their profit from sweatshops, and pedaled low quality garbage clothing that didn't last long before going to land fills.",UngodlyPain,2025-04-28T15:23:59,7
"My dad used to buy phone holsters from a seller in China back when and sell them on Ebay.  Made a bunch of money doing it.  Demand for phone holsters started drying up, and ebay changed some random policy effectively killing his business.  Were he doing that now, he would probably be buying off of something like AliExpress vs Temu - but that is the real issue here, AliExpress is the go-to for *a lot* of commerce in the US, and its going to hurt *a lot* of businesses.",absentmindedjwc,2025-04-28T17:26:28,0
What lower tier physical goods arenâ€™t made in such conditions? Like we do that shit too to an extent.   All this is doing is wiping out small businesses with no inventory or reserves to weather the storm. This has nothing to do with morality or how shitty they are - this isnâ€™t unique to temu dropshippers.  This is shitty trend regardless in grand scheme of things. Idk why people are making distinctions. It will and is fucking over everyone if tariffs donâ€™t get handled soon.,Yourmotherssonsfatha,2025-04-28T15:54:47,2
"Am I defending other garbage? No. Yeah there are some terrible business practices here too, hate them as well. Did I ever say I didn't? No.   I agree there are other better small businesses that will also be adversely affected and I feel bad for them. I simply specified I don't feel bad for Temu drop shippers in particular.   Yeah it's a very shitty trend. Because distinctions are important, sorry to tell you. And I agree I hope the tariff stupidity gets handled soon. I again didn't defend the tariff stupidity, simply said I don't feel bad for a subset of its victims in particular.",UngodlyPain,2025-04-28T16:02:39,2
Why is it distinctive? Why is that important?  You do understand the same practices are done by ALL importers? The only differences are order scale and inventory requirements that they use to dropship.  Thatâ€™s just called being a distributor in the process. Larger corporations and even smaller ones do this in form of white labeling. Itâ€™s not different at all.  You donâ€™t have to feel bad for them but singling them out is fucking weird lmao.,Yourmotherssonsfatha,2025-04-28T16:12:29,0
"I don't know, ask TintedApostle way up the comment chain, he's the one who made the distinction.   No, not all importers are that bad. There is a large gradient of ethics behind importers, and not all are equally bad.   There are things you can do to be better or worse in the process. I don't really approve of white labels either all that much.   Again, I didn't single them out, again bring that complained with TintedApostle and the above connectors who did. All I did was hop in to the conversation to tell ManInTheWoodsDude that he shouldn't judge things based of the face value of the soundness of their investment and life plans but based on the merits of what they're actually doing, which in this case still largely isn't great.",UngodlyPain,2025-04-28T16:18:45,1
