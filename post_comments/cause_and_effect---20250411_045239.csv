"the more that people are seeing the video of him in the Oval bragging about Charles Schwab and his cronies making billions, all while regular americans lost those billions on a non-sensical strategy, i think impeachment MIGHT have legs…  it was a transfer of wealth from all americans to a small few with insider info. plain and simple",biznash,2025-04-11T12:01:59,2
