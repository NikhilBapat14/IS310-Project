"***Most*** CEOs don't support Trump though, broadly speaking. They're all BEGGING to be on the exempt list for tariffs.   ***""But what about this or that CEO?""***  Zuckerberg is supporting Trump because he's extremely scared of Trump weaponizing the law against him.  Musk is deepthroating Trump mostly because he's the worlds richest man with a ""little man"" complex who needs a way to be fulfilled in life, and owning the US govt is everybody's wet dream.  Tim Cook is supporting Trump because he knows he can get exempt from Tariffs which will give him a competitive edge in the market     But other than a small handful of CEOs that you're thinking of, a lot of CEOs don't support Trumps economic policy and most people who do support him have an alterior motive such as the CEOs mentioned above, or how Eric Adams supports Trump because he doesn't wanna go to jail.",Gullible-Ideal8731,2025-04-25T02:42:07,11

"They do support him for all the reasons you just said. They know they can use their wealth to convince the transactional president to shield them from his BS while hammering the little guys. They can then buy up the little guys.    These guys won’t personally feel any pain. You think musk is gonna actually feel losing 100 billion ?? Dude still 200 billion, he doesn’t care, and he got all our data, government contracts, and will be exempt from all tariffs. Same goes for the other guys. ",Ashamed_Job_8151,2025-04-25T06:57:59,3
