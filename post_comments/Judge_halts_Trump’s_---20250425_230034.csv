"If the last few years has taught us anything, it’s that Unions need a resurgence, need to grow, and most importantly, need to get meaner.   Fight dirty. The other side is…..",Paulie_Walnuts1984,2025-04-26T00:05:44,26

"Is too late and useless. Because one of the largest federal worker union, AFGE, already laid off half of their staff. The gov banned the union just by EO and they can't take member dues from 2/3 of the gov agencies anymore. And they still have to pay for all these lawsuits, while the DOJ has unlimited money and time to mess with the federal workers for 4 years.   It is a lawfare that the DOJ will never lose. Because no matter what happen, they would never be held responsible. Meanwhile is a lawfare that the unions will never win, because the justice came too late, and it is very time consuming and expensive.",nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-04-26T07:24:04,-1
"I mean. If you look at the history of how unions got started there's a lot of murder, brawling, and general mayhem and violence. Mostly committed against organizers and strikers. Hell, they used airplanes to drop bombs on union strikers.  But the unions really did start punching back, eventually. And hard.   We don't have a 40 hour work week and the recognition of overtime and health benefits because corporations are nice. It's because of standards unions first fought for. And I mean actually fought, with their fists, for.   I don't even know what actually counts as ""fighting dirty"" when there's a fucking boot on your neck, you know?",sp0rkah0lic,2025-04-26T04:33:32,17
