">""we are the only nation in position to have the capacity to bring people together to lead the world.""  There needs to be a shared underlying value of not destroying each other.

"What's going on here, Biden, is because you continued to run during the election, instead of having a primary like you promised. Then bowed out halfway confusing voters and forcing an unpopular vice president into the race. Trump was able to win an election and has been busy destroying America ever since.   Maybe if you hadn't done that, we wouldn't be in the position we are now.",FreshRest4945,2025-05-07T14:22:13,1

What’s going on is your incompetence of your 4 years of not listening to the middle class and pandering to centrist dems/big corporations. All money for more war and immigrants turned everyone the other way into the predicament we are in now.,MostlyAnimosity,2025-05-07T16:32:09,-1

"Getting enough sleep, taking his medication, not travelling, not having Covid for the umpteenth time... of course he sounds better.

"It was all right wing propagandist wanting is to believe Biden was losing it. He’s old and he’s human. We all have our good and bad days it just so happens as you get older the bad days can be really bad but the good days can be really good. The amount of stress an election put on someone I’m not surprised he had more bad days than good. Trump has clearly been on the decline based on his posture, and the flip flopping he does because he can’t remember his lies from one day to the next.",a_rabid_buffalo,2025-05-07T18:28:42,0
He didn't even need powers granted by scotus. He had all the authority he needed as commander in chief to have trump arrested following the coup attempt. He explicitly chose not to exercise his authority out of some desire for bipartisanship or forgiveness or whatever. But Biden more than anyone else is the reason Trump isn't sitting in a jail cell today. He is a disgrace and should remove himself from the public eye altogether. ,Bakedads,2025-05-07T14:41:21,11

This kind of bullshit is exactly why were in this situation.  You fell for obvious propoganda making Biden out too be incompetent when he's clearly fast from it.   Maybe think of what this comment tells tells about YOU.   Was Biden old? Yes. Was he competent to lead and surrounds himself with the right people? Also yes.   Were there vested interests that gained by making him look worse to help trump who is also old and potentially doddering? Yes.,Trump_Eats_bASS,2025-05-07T14:46:21,11

"Geez man, just making a joke- since, ya know, we are far enough into the regime that replaced him that I think we can safely say any hot takes from Biden aren't adding much. I haven't fallen for any propaganda. I recognize- as the vast majority of Dem. voters did- that being POTUS is first and foremost a sales job. Biden is a competent leader who did have great people around him but was not up to the task of convincing enough undecided idiots that this was the case. In an increasingly polarized country with so much noise competing for voters' attention, he nor Kamala could cut through with a clear message. Not sure I care what you think me pointing out these obvious facts says about me. Totally agree that there were vested interests piling on Biden but him staying in as long as it did made their job far too easy.",Anthemic_Fartnoises,2025-05-07T15:58:48,-1

"Complacency about fascism, for both voters and the mainstream media, was the decisive factor. If the candidate had been someone other than Biden or Harris I expect that complacency about fascism would have still been the deciding factor.   People were pissed off about inflation, Trump was giving them empty promises, and conservative media (plus the cowardice of prominent mainstream media) meant that many voters were badly misinformed. A lot of voters on the right were convinced that the fascism Trump was offering was the medicine America needed, and a lot of voters on the left just didn't care enough about fascism to vote against it.",KingKrasnov,2025-05-07T15:03:41,6

"Yes and. You’re severely underestimating how long republicans have been planning something like this, you’re underestimating how much our media affected voters, the lack of voter turnout, and most importantly, Trump himself. Yeah things might have turned out differently if his ego wasn’t so big, but there’s so many factors that go into an election campaign it’s insane to me to pin every failure on one singular guy. Also can’t forget election interference which was proven in the last election.",Smooth_Weird_2081,2025-05-07T14:27:55,6
"He did more than that. Democratic Party leaders wanted a primary and Harris wasn’t even sure she wanted the nod (she would have ran in a primary, no doubt, but based on the polls at the time, a lot of the top candidates were thinking it wasn’t a good idea to have a rushed campaign against Trump and a loss)  Biden gave nobody a choice when he stepped aside and threw his support immediately behind Harris, just to spite Pelosi.",PointedlyDull,2025-05-07T14:38:12,2
Were they perhaps complacent because Democrat’s let a geriatric octogenarian lead the charge against fascism?,bestforward121,2025-05-07T15:32:36,-1
"What did Biden do to stop Trump? He and his team hid his mental decline, they ran a sham primary, and then tried to flank the conservatives from the right on immigration.   He lost this all by himself. Should have been an easy win.",Final-Mountain6777,2025-05-07T14:29:53,-5
"If one candidate is openly fascist, and the deciding factor for whether someone votes against that fascist or not is whether the other candidate excites them, then fascism wasn't a factor in their decision. That's what it means to be complacent about fascism.",KingKrasnov,2025-05-07T15:52:17,7
"There's no ""easy win"" when a third of the voters *want* fascism, and another third *don't think fascism is bad enough to vote against.*  If you were in the third that voted against fascism, then you're one of the voters who shouldn't be blamed.",KingKrasnov,2025-05-07T15:06:56,0
