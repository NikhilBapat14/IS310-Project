Now pay back all the money you forced everyone else to spend defending this.,thistimelineisweird,2025-05-07T10:09:27,373
He worked hard with Republicans to undermine the voting results but failed. Failed Cheater on his headstone and his enablers,Inevitable-Ad9760,2025-05-07T10:12:14,133

"This is some excellent news.  It's not a game changer, but it's always nice when evil is defeated, even a little bit.",mysticrhythms,2025-05-07T10:15:37,71
"This is actually pretty significant. If they had succeeded, that would have empowered them even more. Obviously, nothing is preventing them from trying this again...but a flat out loss might cause them to think twice. Maybe. Hopefully.   We have to win every time, fascists just have to win \*once\*. Remember that.",Prayer_Warrior21,2025-05-07T10:53:12,30
At least he can take solace in being more than a footnote in the destruction of American Democracy.     Multiply this out by every election in the country. No losing margin is too big to contest. All you need is a few law firms who owe you pro bono work because you threatened them and you can keep going forever.,specqq,2025-05-07T10:12:26,15
This headline begs for correction. “GOP candidate ends attempt to steal election”,Agitated_Hornet_7018,2025-05-07T11:44:35,15
"From what it sounds like, it was settled when the votes were counted the first time.",Those_Silly_Ducks,2025-05-07T14:02:23,5
It was settled in November.,LHGray87,2025-05-07T12:28:57,3
Violated people's civil rights and no consequences. This is going to be every election now because there are no consequences.,threehundredthousand,2025-05-07T13:42:45,4
I remember when these clowns were the party of fiscal responsibility. I miss those days.,No_Caramel_1782,2025-05-07T11:59:48,3
Republicans failed in their blatant effort to steal this election.,2-wheels,2025-05-07T12:19:07,3
Oh thank goodness.  One dull but slightly brighter patch in an otherwise grim shroud of reality,MissionCreeper,2025-05-07T11:33:55,2

Tired of winning yet? :) ,Chinaroos,2025-05-07T12:08:51,1
Great now fix the damn voting districts.,Any_Reason_2588,2025-05-07T12:12:47,1
GOP - always seek first to disenfranchise,Financial-Tower-7897,2025-05-07T22:16:10,1
The Republicans will be furious that he conceded! The more trying to eat each other the better!,RadishLegitimate9488,2025-05-07T23:01:48,1
And the voters he targeted.,MentalTourniquet,2025-05-07T10:15:55,97
I would like to see something like this happen to bad faith challenges,DerpEnaz,2025-05-07T12:12:02,50
Would need a counter-suit for that.,YouWereBrained,2025-05-07T12:57:55,2
Exactly,Fun-Dinner-2562,2025-05-07T13:36:10,1
"I'm relieved, because I was entirely prepared to be disappointed with the outcome on this one. After all this is the nation that re-elected the guy that sent a mob to hang his VP when he lost an election.",MadRaymer,2025-05-07T11:30:25,38
"I'd argue, at least for now, it is a game changer. They almost certainly wanted this case to be a win so they could use it as precedent for other seats across the country, luckily for all of us they hit a brick wall almost 6 months in and now the precedent is set against this tactic and not for it.",NinjaKlaus,2025-05-07T10:59:33,44
"If the penalty is a fine, then it's only a crime if you're poor.",WiglyWorm,2025-05-07T12:31:21,31
This is literally how it works everywhere else. The US is one of the few countries that doesn't have a loser pays legal system.,yarash,2025-05-07T12:45:11,9
Don't get too excited.  This judge just made the short list to replace Clarence Thomas.,stripedvitamin,2025-05-07T13:38:55,12
More than that. The court is set in such a way to force fairer election maps from Republicans in NC as well. They’re going to lose seats from this.,SeatKindly,2025-05-07T11:06:48,34
"What unique tactic were they doing? Also, precedent is out the window.  Whatever the tactic it ws.",mokomi,2025-05-07T11:51:31,1
This is the way,DerpEnaz,2025-05-07T12:34:27,5
"Depends.  If the penalty is a fine based on % of net worth, it's not only a crime if you're poor.",Natural6,2025-05-07T17:12:41,4
It's also one of the few where the winner can win based on having more money.,VietOne,2025-05-07T13:05:30,9
There’s always a catch,Ok-Raisin-9606,2025-05-07T13:55:11,6
What do you mean by this. Genuinely curious as NC desperately needs a check on the rampant gerrymandering,Best-Expression-7582,2025-05-08T07:55:00,1
If I followed correctly it was: Targeting specifically 4 dem majority counties and then specifically going after nullifying mail-in ballots from military overseas. I think there may have been some signature verification part of the attack too.,lthightower,2025-05-07T12:00:20,14
"My opinion is it's unique in that it wasn't just a ""normal"" contest of the election but an attempt to purposely disenfranchise voters for following the rules they were given, not the ones made up by the State after the vote.",NinjaKlaus,2025-05-07T12:15:58,7
Yes they were trying to set *new* precedent,MoonOut_StarsInvite,2025-05-08T07:53:13,1
"So, for this to really work what you need is that at the baseline you repay the damage to the taxpayer, and then there's punitive damages, and then there's a wealth kicker to keep the percent inline.  I agree.  Unfortunately the world we live in is one in which a couple meth-heads are busy stealing our nation's catalytic converter.",WiglyWorm,2025-05-07T18:25:27,5
