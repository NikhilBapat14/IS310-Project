"Oops, that's not good for Taiwan. Taiwan is highly dependent on exports of semiconductors and a rise in the local currency means Taiwanese products lose competitiveness.   Also, we've already seen a lot of inflation at the local level. While prices are still low relative to other countries, they have been climbing slowly. A higher exchange value on the currency puts pressure on those price hikes. This is not good news.   The major beneficiaries of a rising NTD would be S. Korea and China. The KRW is also up but the Chinese Yuan appears to be fluctuating. This could ultimately be in China's favor.",ahfoo,2025-05-05T01:05:38,2

"What are you saying? Obviously, the strengthening would hurt the export industry. But at the same time a stronger Taiwan dollar makes imports from abroad cheaper, if anything that would help counter inflation.",GreenIsland_410,2025-05-05T17:29:37,1
