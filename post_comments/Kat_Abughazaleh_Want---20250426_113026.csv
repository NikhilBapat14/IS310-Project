"I like her. I like her as a candidate and I like her on policy. She’s sharp, she’s serious, and she understands the need to actually show up and fight, not just posture.  Her focus on small-dollar donations tells me she understands where the rot is and why it matters. She’s not here to kiss the ring.  My only wish is that she leaned a little harder into the truth that you can fight the authoritarians and the corporate rot inside your own party at the same time. The two are not separate fights.

"*Kamala Harris’s campaign, with its focus on catering to the right rather than the Democratic base, marked another moment of political awakening for Abughazaleh. It all came to a head during last summer’s Democratic National Convention in Chicago, which she attended as a credentialed creator. The whole thing felt wrong from the get-go, she told me: “I felt like a token. Like, the token Palestinian creator.”*  *But she really lost faith in Democratic leadership on the third night of the convention. While she was waiting for her Uber to leave the United Center, delegates from the Uncommitted Movement—a group advocating for Palestinian rights and an end to the genocide in Gaza—were staging a sit-in outside of the convention hall to push for a Palestinian American speaker to take the stage at the DNC and elevate the Palestinian cause to the Democratic platform. As soon as she heard about the sit-in, Abughazaleh returned to the United Center and joined them. She eventually spent the whole night on the cold concrete.*  *In the end, despite talks between the protesters and the Harris campaign, Democrats did not make space for a Palestinian American speaker. It was a move that Abughazaleh saw as both racist and politically ineffective.*  ---  It's pretty clear she's one of those that did everything possible to stop Harris.  So she's the reason we're in this position now.",Joadzilla,2025-04-26T11:46:06,-11

"The current favorites are current Mayor and former State Senator Daniel Biss and State Senator Laura Fine.   BTW Biss was the favorite since *last year* when there were first speculations that Congresswoman Jan schakowsky would retire this term. Schakowsky has also not confirmed for sure that she's retiring, just that she's seriously considering it and will announce her decision may 5th.    Kat comes across as the phony machine candidate to most people here actually because of how hard the media is pushing her and how much money she raised from out-of-state.   edit: spelling",GrabaBrushand,2025-04-26T18:05:39,3
"Yeah, but it feels more like the shit the GOP played in Florida.  They:  Had a guy run with the same name as another candidate [in a ghost candidate scheme](https://apnews.com/general-news-e8b70ce3270bd170e37a71ca80b5aaae)  And also had a woman [run as a D and switch to R immediately after the election.](https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/florida-house-democrat-hillary-cassel-switches-to-republican/)  This one feels more like the second situation.    And there's also the fact that the district skews very Jewish, and Jan Schakowsky  who she'd be running against (before Jan announces she's going to retire anyway which seems to be coming next week) definitely skews toward Jewish special interests, and Kat is hyper-pro-palastine.  Making it a strange place for her to run when she doesn't even live in the district boundary.    All that said, Jan *is* too damn old, and should've hung it up long ago... like to Dick Durbin's credit, Dick is.  But the flip side is all of this makes Jan super vulnerable to a carpet bagging attack, or reverse carpet bagging, as the case may be.",stevejust,2025-04-26T19:11:16,2

"Substantive change was coming either by force (see: Jan 6) or by necessity. It's hard to say how everything will play out—but I'd rather the Democrats work to reform their ranks meaningfully, in any scenario. Which even that, is unlikely to happen with Citizen's United still in existence. What we've begun to see is the MAGA spell begin to break. The opportunity to re-unite and direct (actual) citizens' collective ire back at the powers it should be looking at, will be waiting.    Is the party ready for that? Will they follow the wills of their constituents and help develop a leader to carry that message?
