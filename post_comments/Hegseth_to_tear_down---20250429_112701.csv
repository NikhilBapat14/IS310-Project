Trump signed the law. Many of his little bitch boys and girls pushed for and voted for the law. Now they want to overturn it because it’s DEI. They are even claiming this is a Biden era law.  Literally nothing is safe with these idiots.,Ancient_Popcorn,2025-04-29T11:34:33,5

"*Hegseth said the Pentagon would comply with the minimum requirements of the program under federal statute and then lobby to kill the program during the appropriations process.*  *Hegseth’s attack on the program is especially notable since Trump signed the program into law and multiple members of Trump’s current cabinet backed the effort as members of Congress.*  *Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, then a member of Congress from South Dakota, wrote the 2017 Women, Peace and Security Act alongside Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.). Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a former Florida senator, co-sponsored that chamber’s version of the law. That bill codified the “women, peace and security” agenda and its priorities across the State Department, Pentagon and other government agencies into U.S. law.*  *As recently as this month, Rubio hailed Trump’s decision to sign the Women, Peace and Security Act, describing it as “the first law passed by any country in the world focused on protecting women and promoting their participation in society.”*  *National security adviser Mike Waltz was not in Congress when the 2017 law was signed, but he supported subsequent legislation to bolster the “women, peace and security” agenda and served as the co-chair of the bipartisan Women, Peace and Security Caucus.*",Ok-Lets-Talk-It-Out,2025-04-29T11:33:39,1
