I really don't like all this back and forth changing of tarrifs.   Any negotiating position is rendered moot when other countries just wait it out,Dutchtdk,2025-04-23T04:50:31,808
So what did trump ultimately get from the tarrif war?,LastManSleeping,2025-04-23T02:33:32,1266
"It‚Äôs really hard to view this pivot to ‚Äúactually guys it was always about China from the very start‚Äù as anything other than attempt to save face on this tariff war. There are several significant things Trump could do in order to win a trade war with China and almost none of them occurred yet.b  The unseriousness of Trump on this trade war can be summed up the fake tariff rates on that cardboard sign and people like Peter Navarro. Pointing it all back to ‚Äúit‚Äôs about China‚Äù is the only tariff policy most Americans are likely to support in some way. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with moderating a position and I respect Trump for doing so. But I think if he thought he could do it, he‚Äôd absolutely enact those fake reciprocal tariff rates on other countries, friend and foe alike.",EliteJassassin101,2025-04-23T03:23:58,680

It's not that tariffs are unpopular. It's that they cannot possibly achieve what Trump has been promising. Certainly not the way they have gone about this.

"Nothing.  And at this point any company that was considering moving manufacturing back to the US would be absolute morons to do so now.  Why move if the tariffs are going to go down ""substantially?""  Why completly upend your manufacturing and supply chain, spend a billion dollars on a new factory, millions more to train new people, and ten times as much to pay them to do the work if it turns out you only have to pay 5% more because Trump dropped his tariffs?  Hopefully he's getting over his tariff obsession.  If he's going to drop them against the only country we really should be tariffing in the first place, it is likely he will drop them against our actual allies that he's been attacking recently.  It'll be a few years before we recover from the damage that was done, but at least we'll be moving forward now.  This month's numbers have been pretty scary.",cathbadh,2025-04-23T12:27:31,241

"First, that depends on what he lowers them to. If cut in half, it's still 75% due to the back and forth posturing. Maybe it gives China a chance to negotiate while saving face.  They will negotiate. China has been in trouble for a while now, with workers not being paid and protesting. They shot themselves in the foot, threatening other countries.   In the end, most likely, there will be some sort of deal. Either way, we should be in a better place than before.

They make those in the US to support defense and commercial industries but they are priced appropriately. Look at Bugeye.  These are generally pretty simple electromechanical assemblies and we already have well-established supply chains to support domestic manufacturing. It‚Äôs basically just a bunch of momentary pushbutton switches and some angle sensors (typically Hall effect or magnetoresistive).

"Yeah that‚Äôs kind of what tariffs do, but when appropriately used as an instrument for protectionist policy they also spur investment in domestic industries and foreign states with friendly trade policy. I‚Äôm a design engineer and I‚Äôm seeing it to some extent right now. All of the major electronics distributors and industrial suppliers are now flagging tariffed products and/or indicating COO in the search results to steer you towards alternatives. The price difference isn‚Äôt as high as you would expect and you‚Äôre usually getting a higher quality product.  China keeps their prices low not only through low labor costs and domestic subsidies, but also by frequently misrepresenting the quality of their products. You pay for that later on in increased product failure rates and/or liability costs. Importers quickly find out that sourcing from China isn‚Äôt quite the panacea they hoped to bring up margins when they end up paying for a full-time team of QC inspectors to make sure they aren‚Äôt getting a fake product. Anyone who has dealt with say ‚Äú316 stainless steel‚Äù from China will back me up on this. Read [*Poorly Made in China*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poorly_Made_in_China) by Paul Midler for some entertaining personal anecdotes.  As an aside I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm even bothering to respond. I just get particularly irritated when I see these highly-upvoted trite remarks. If you‚Äôre going to be critical, be specific.  **EDIT:** [further reading](https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/state-us-tariffs-april-15-2025) from The Budget Lab at Yale on the projected distributional impact of the current tariff policy. While this doesn‚Äôt consider all of the intangible costs and benefits, if the current policy remains stable and we forget about the fake ‚Äúreciprocal tariffs‚Äù (this is mainly where I take issue with Trump‚Äôs approach), we should expect rapid recovery post-substitution.",zip117,2025-04-23T11:32:39,-45

"Gosh darn I hope that's the case.  This has been a pain point i've always had with Trump....freakin tariffs.  People on both sides, most people in fact, do not understand domestic and global trade beyond the talking points of their parties.  Even if you study economics for years you will only know a fraction of what you need to know to begin to talk about it with an informed opinion at a granular level.  There has always been this wing of economic study which puts tariffs as a cure-all for trade woes.  Thinking tariffs could bring in enough to replace income taxes is a faulty line of thought when you follow the logical curve to its end.  The world would be much better off without any tariffs, that should be the goal.  We should be talking about how to reach that end.  Shotgunning the world with tariffs all at once quite literally without warning, and telling small business owners to ""suck it up""; ""this will be good for you""; ""there will be some pain"" is quite literally the dumbest plan, second to Obama on Obamacare...""If you like your plan you can keep it""; ""Families will save $2500 a year!""; ""Affordable healthcare for all""!  All bullshit.  Trump needs to focus on making us more competitive by reducing regulations and DEEP government cuts and taxes.  I own a small business and so far Trump has only caused volatility in the markets and equipment costs to skyrocket.  I've actually had to hold off on an expansion because the investment cost is now too high.  This expansion may include 1-2 full time good American jobs, now put on hold until further notice.  Plenty of companies who employ Americans are in a holding pattern right now, hoping tariffs are temporary because if not, they'll need to reorder, scale down, or even leave the US entirely.  How is this good for US businesses and consumers?",sailedtoclosetodasun,2025-04-23T11:02:55,99

"Completely agree on these specific points. This is what informed criticism looks like. I do believe there is justification for targeted tariffs on China, even at high levels, but only when implemented gradually. Even if you think the Miran [blueprint](https://www.hudsonbaycapital.com/documents/FG/hudsonbay/research/638199_A_Users_Guide_to_Restructuring_the_Global_Trading_System.pdf) is a bit unconventional, notice how careful he is to explain the importance of *graduated* tariff implementation and the harms that could result otherwise. Right here in black-and-white we have the chair of Trump‚Äôs Council of Economic Advisors *directly* criticizing the current approach, and this is November 2024. I doubt he has changed his mind.  The worldwide ‚Äúreciprocal tariffs‚Äù caught me off guard and the [attempt](https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/files/Issue_Areas/Presidential%20Tariff%20Action/Reciprocal%20Tariff%20Calculations.pdf) at post hoc rationalization was complete nonsense. Furthermore this idea of replacing income taxes with tariffs is *mathematically impossible* under any reasonable elasticity assumptions (Laffer curves) as explained by PIIE: [Can Trump replace income taxes with tariffs?](https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2024/can-trump-replace-income-taxes-tariffs)  Even without formal economics training it shouldn‚Äôt be difficult to see the faults here, so let‚Äôs just see this for the propaganda it is and move on. Those with formal economics training will have more immediate concerns, particularly surrounding recent instability in the bond markets and arbitrage activity in commodities markets e.g. copper. I‚Äôm still cautiously optimistic that most of this will be walked back, considering the 90 day pause is considerably more leeway than earlier this year. Maybe he‚Äôs finally listening to his advisors, namely Lutnick, Bessent and Miran. He just needs to drop Navarro and we might be back on the right track.

Slapping a tariff on that doesn‚Äôt magically make that reality any less true.
