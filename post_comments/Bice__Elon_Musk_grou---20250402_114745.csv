"> Just how nervous is billionaire Elon Musk about allegations that he may be violating the state's bribery statute by paying people to vote? >  > On Tuesday, Musk's super PAC, America PAC, pulled a video from X featuring $1 million giveaway winner Ekaterina Deistler in which she said she received the money, in part, to ""vote."" X is owned by the tech billionaire. >  > ""My name‚Äôs Ekaterina Deistler,"" she said in a video posted Monday morning. ""I did exactly what Elon Musk told everyone to do: sign the petition, refer friends and family, vote, and now I have a million dollars."" > >But the video was taken down yesterday, and America PAC posted a new video of Deistler on X on Tuesday afternoon.  >""My name‚Äôs Ekaterina Deistler, and I'm from Green Bay, Wisconsin,"" she said in the new video. ""I did exactly what Elon Musk told everyone to do: sign the petition, refer friends and family, and now I have a million dollars.""  >It's almost exactly the same, except the word ""vote"" has been removed. She is no longer saying she was paid, in part, to vote in the Supreme Court race.  >...  >Jeff Mandell, general counsel of the progressive voting rights firm Law Forward, said it's clear what's going on.  > ‚ÄúAmerica PAC keeps changing its cover story, but the underlying reality is unchanged,"" Mandell said. ""That this should happen more than once shouts everything you need to know about their intentions.""",progress18,2025-04-02T11:49:34,129

"She did exactly what Elon told her to! What a good, obedient girl. Seems like the clearest legal case a lawyer could ask for. But of course, any judge ruling on this would clearly be part of a deep state witch hunt, right?",NearbyInformation772,2025-04-02T14:26:41,6

"This guy is openly corrupt. No way to misconstrue what he is doing. For years conservatives have been crying about george soros just because he gave some money to some random organization somewhere in the world. Now we have the worlds richest man, who is around 50 times richer than George Soros, openly giving money to people to vote. This isnt some mysterious boogie man somewhere out in the world, he is an evil, corrupt, psychopath in our very own backyard. We need to fight this with everything, because he has already bought the presidency and will continue to buy more political power.",MaximusDM22,2025-04-02T14:10:45,4
