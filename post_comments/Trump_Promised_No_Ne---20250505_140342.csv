"The Supreme Court had their chance to rule on an Emoluments Clause case in Trump's first term, and they dragged their feet on it then dismissed it as moot.   What happens when you don't enforce the law? This. And the conservatives on the SC are fools if they didn't see this coming. ",Simmery,2025-05-05T14:12:38,38

No shit. Once daddy Trump is out of the picture though Junior and Eric are going to watch the empire crumble. Those two don’t have the same grift gift as their dad. They won’t have the cult and there will be no reason to bribe them. I wouldn’t be surprised if the trumps weren’t back in court for financial crimes and other stuff with a year or two of their father’s passing or maybe Trump can join his sons back in court after he’s out of the White House.,Jagermonsta,2025-05-05T15:51:05,0
