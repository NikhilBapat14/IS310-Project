"This man is a fucking moron. He literally does not believe germs cause sickness. This isn’t me putting words in his mouth, he wrote it in his own damn book. He’s dumber than a bag of rocks and our children are gonna pay for it. I hate him on a level that makes me uncomfortable.",SandyVaj,2025-05-04T05:17:28,74
"All vaccines must go through a continuous process of placebo-controlled trials. Once those trials are completed, they'll be new trials. Then they'll be the Salem Witch trials. Then, the trials will be appealed to the trial board for retrial. The only medications that will not need to go through the trials are Ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, bleach and UV rays. Those will be administered on a continuous basis because their effectiveness is 1 billion percent.",TopEagle4012,2025-05-04T04:14:37,38
"Placebo testing is stupid for vaccines, they are tested versus gold standard of care like most drugs. You don't want your control group to receive nothing and die, so they are given a proven effective drug which is compared to the new drug. Giving someone a saline injection and a false sense of protection is a pretty effective way to kill them.",bairdwh,2025-05-04T06:17:16,33

"Vaccines already go through placebo testing, but this requirement will  force a do-over of placebo testing when there are any modifications made to an existing vaccine, before they can be re-released.  There is no practical way for the annual flu/covid shots to go through this kind of testing and still get released every year.  This is like saying the Nintendo Switch has to go through FCC recertification each time it gets a new combination of parts.  (FYI,  the screens on the Nintendo Switch were provided by JDI, AUO, Innolux, Samsung, and Sharp, depending on which model, where, and when they were produced.  And that's just one part of the device.). Even if the parts are made to the same specifications and even on the same factory nodes.",GaimeGuy,2025-05-04T05:37:00,5

"Well... not neceessarily.  If there's already a vaccine that's known to be safe and effective, it makes more sense to test against that than a placebo for a few reasons:  1. There's a huge ethical problem.  A bunch of people will get a saline injection rather than a vaccination and nobody will ever know who was who. 2. This translates into a difficulty in finding test subjects.  ""We're looking for people to put their children forward for this new measles vaccine as part of their immunisation programme.  If your child is put into this, there's a chance they will get no measles vaccine at all and you won't know!"". 3. The question you want answered often isn't ""is this better than a placebo?"".  It's ""is this better than the best product currently on the market?"".  And if the answer to that is ""no it's not"" - who cares if it's better than a placebo?  Getting something set up for mass production isn't cheap; there's not an awful lot of point in going to that expense for something that's substantially less effective than the current state of the art.",jimicus,2025-05-04T04:39:58,21
Imagine you have cancer.  We already have a treatment for it.  We come up with a new treatment.  RFK wants people with cancer to skip out on our already available treatment and use a placebo to test the new treatment.  This is psychotic.,DramaticSweet3412,2025-05-04T05:05:10,15
