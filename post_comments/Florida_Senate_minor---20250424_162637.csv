">The Democratic Party in Florida is dead  When you're one of the highest-elected officeholders of the political party you're claiming is dead, and so you also probably were in a position to either obstruct or hasten that demise, quitting the party like a sore loser taking his ball and going home, is not the great look you probably think it is.",pierre_x10,2025-04-24T16:33:45,12
"If a leader says their party is dead, I'd tend to believe it because  it often rots from the top down. But I'm not seeing that where i live.",noage,2025-04-24T16:27:42,11

Ffs take a single class on campaign finance and you will find out how hopeless third party politics is. ,Maximum_District1959,2025-04-24T16:51:28,3
He’s no real leader. Just a flop looking to line his pockets.,Texas_sucks15,2025-04-24T16:31:51,6
"This is actually probably a decent play in some areas. I don't know the actual reasoning behind his switch, but Democrat policies \*are\* popular if they aren't tied to a (D) candidate...this might have to be the move in some red states and areas. Not saying this is HIS reasoning, but there is some merit in the overall idea.",Prayer_Warrior21,2025-04-24T17:12:40,2

I think the headline meant to say he's switching to the republican party. An independent in Florida is effectively invisible.,Traditional-Level-96,2025-04-25T08:35:18,1
Florida is also a weird ass state. The party isn't dead at all outside of Florida If you live in most major cities it would still be embarrassing as F to publicly associate yourself with Trump.,Bruce-7891,2025-04-24T16:41:09,6

"Democrats are running a candidate though-here, the state party is basically united behind Jolly, and the state party chair called Pizzo an idiot. So by this point, there's possibly going to be three Democrats and ex-Democrats in 2026's gubernatorial election (John Morgan is also running, although I think he'll pull about equally).",IvantheGreat66,2025-04-25T15:08:13,1
The Democratic party in FL is definitely dead and Trump won 4 out of 7 of the highest populated counties including Miami-Dade by a landslide.,Mundane_Rabbit7751,2025-04-24T18:34:15,2
Could split the vote I suppose.,Prayer_Warrior21,2025-04-25T15:26:30,1
"Yeah, basically (not that it means much at this point, Jolly is likely toast without Pizzo and Morgan).",IvantheGreat66,2025-04-25T15:27:41,1
