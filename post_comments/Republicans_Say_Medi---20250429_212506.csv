This one is easy to stop.    Make sure everyone hears again and again that these are cuts.    Rebaged cuts but cuts.  When you hear people talking about them say yeah you have heard about the cuts the Republicans are trying to make for Medicare.,wanderingpeddlar,2025-04-29T21:39:41,47
But they do.,accountabilitycounts,2025-04-29T21:32:21,57
"Of course. They can remove everything from Medicaid, and none of the removals will count.",usernames_suck_ok,2025-04-29T21:40:56,21
"Oh.. yeah.. we're only going to cut benefits from approximately 36 million people as estimated by a Republican think tank.    But, yeah.. these cuts are not cuts.  Lying pieces of crap.  Somehow, I think the people being cut would say it counts as cuts.  https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/medicaid-work-requirements-could-put-36-million-people-at-risk-of-losing-health  Man, these jackasses can't even propaganda convincingly at this point.  ""Don't believe your own eyes.""",Hypothesising_Null,2025-04-29T22:47:15,16
So somebody has an accident or a medical issue that loses them their job and now they can't apply for Medicaid because they don't have a job. These are the people being denied medicaid.,a_little_hazel_nuts,2025-04-29T21:53:03,26
"The proposals they’ve put forth in the recent past have all been along the lines of requiring able-bodied adults under 50 to spend 20 hours per week on work (where unemployment is below a threshold), education, or volunteering in order to receive Medicaid benefits.  People with disabilities, pregnant women, medically frail, caregivers of dependents, and people over 50 would be  exempt from the requirement.   I think the challenge would managing and enforcing those requirements without additional spending or adequate staffing.",Ok-Conversation2707,2025-04-29T21:42:35,11
"So the usual BS they've been spouting with splitting hairs over wordplay/semantics. ""The supreme court said facilitate not effectuate Garcia's return! A day, for the purpose of this congressional session, actually means the rest of the entire congressional session! Trump never said inject bleach! He said inject disinfectant!""",prodigalpariah,2025-04-29T23:33:38,4
"It has become abundantly clear that for Trump & Co homeless, jobless and poor people don't matter at all. Just cut all programs helping those and they'll die and stop being a burden on the purses of the rich who desperately need to get richer. Poor people are evil, rich people are good and Trump is the Truth & Salvation, amen!",bartpieters,2025-04-30T01:23:13,3
Wouldn’t work requirements actually end of costing more? The admin costs of evaluating and handling the paper work seems like a pretty big cost.,Large-Club-2420,2025-04-30T01:38:07,3
They love semantics,No_Pressure_1289,2025-04-30T09:27:21,1
The funniest shit is passing work requirements when we’re basically at or right behind peak employment and likely heading into a downturn. They want to crush wages so badly while keeping prices as high as possible.,True-Surprise1222,2025-04-30T01:32:22,10
"It is actively WORSE than a cut: they intend that work requirements will force people out of healthcare, but that also means they are going to have to pay for work tracking systems. So people will have less healthcare, but it isn't actually going to save anything.  Not unless they remove disability entirely, though I suppose that was always the end goal.",ragingreaver,2025-04-30T11:33:56,2
And  you know  Republican sycophants will always qualify.  Sprained ankle? - have a week of benefits.,dkorabell,2025-04-30T00:44:05,2
"Medicaid almost exclusively serves pregnant women, children, the disabled and elderly. Please tell me exactly how “work requirements” are beneficial…",Organic-Class-8537,2025-04-30T08:36:21,3
You also place the burden on those who should be exempt from the requirements on proving they should be exempt.,L_obsoleta,2025-04-29T22:26:32,14
"Psst.... The plan is to have no mechanism to manage them and then say ""No met the requirements"". Boom no payments",oldguydrinkingbeer,2025-04-29T23:28:44,7
You see they’ve fired all the staff to manage the requirements so nobody can get approved as there’s nobody left to manage it.,ioncloud9,2025-04-30T04:58:49,3
"> I think the challenge would managing and enforcing those requirements without additional spending or adequate staffing.  That's likely the goal. Deny all applications automatically for not meeting the requirements. Applicant appeals the denial, but the appeal will take <XX> months to process due to an ""unexpectedly high volume of appeals"" and ""staffing challenges"".",phyneas,2025-04-30T05:24:05,3
"Not exactly how Medicaid works, but I get your sentiment.  The Medicaid application process varies from state to state as the program is managed at the state level.  However, there is no such thing as ""a week of benefits.""  You either meet the qualifications in your state or you don't.  Benefits are typically reevaluated every 12 months.  Instituting work requirements will do several things:  1. Require states to institute a mechinism for beneficiaries to report their employment status and likely hours worked.  This will create additional administrative overhead likely costing more than any reduction in beneficiaries would save.  2. By default eliminate caregivers and others who can not work for one reason or another.  Including people who may or will qualify for disability, but are still working their way through what is often a multi-year process to apply for Social Security Disability benefits.  These people may not survive without care while waiting for a disability determination.  3. Cause people who would otherwise be eligible for benefits to be denied or dropped because either due to mental disability, poor language proficiency, or lack of education are unable to properly complete the application and regularly report their work acitivity.  Some may not have regular or reliable Internet access or know how to navigate the Internet and the government system for reporting the information.  These are just the top three issues most often cited for the problem with work requirements.  They are nothing more than a way to cut benefits while using a ""bootstraps"" argument that resonates with people who still believe in the ""welfare queen"" myth pushed in the 1980's to attack the social safety net.",Hypothesising_Null,2025-04-30T15:50:00,1
"Similar to how unemployment benefits work here.  Having a disability will complicate things for beneficiaries. The beneficiary will say their disability prevented them from getting / taking the job, the government will argue the opposite and cut benefits.",dkorabell,2025-04-30T18:11:40,1
