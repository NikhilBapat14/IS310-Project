">I am curious how Kamala has created such a large following and so much support in such a short amount of time?  Democrats *really* want to win. Biden, because of his age, was a particularly bad candidate and in a death spiral. After three weeks of work to get him to step down from his re-election campaign, Democrats were exhausted with the fighting and bad press and wanted unity.   >It seems like last month no one liked her  Probably more accurate to say people had weakly held negative views of Harris.  Most people don't think about the VP much, and Harris was fairly quite as VP as well. So for a lot of people, their most recent ""serious"" thoughts about Harris would had been in relation to her bad 2020 campaign.   Needless to say, weakly held view are much easier to change, than strongly held views. Which are the case with both Biden and Trump for obvious reasons.    >Has she changed her stance on things?  She has distanced herself from many (perceived) unpopular stances she took in her failed 2020 campaign.   >How is she more supported now?   1. A lot of people REALLY don't like Trump  2. She has taken up the proverbial baton and has been sprinting with it since Biden dropped out (so far the Harris/Walz campaign have been doing a great job at exciting the base and avoiding generating negative news cycles)  3. Trump and Vance have been non-stop generating negative news cycles through their weird (Vance picking a fight childless people/women) and erratic behavior (Trump's disastrous NABJ interview)",Scaryclouds,2024-08-08T15:44:05,133
Campaigns cost a lot of money and only [Kamala is able to still use the funds from Biden‚Äôs campaign because she was also on the ticket](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/91-million-question-what-happens-bidens-campaign-money-2024-07-18/).

"It helps that she was thrust into the limelight and just knocked it out of the park. The way she handled that first week was enough to show me she can handle the job. Then she chose Walz who is another homerun hitter.  Its the immaculate transition.  It was like watching Joe Montana, unproven sophmore QB, jump into the game late in the second after the ND star star QB got injured in a lopsided game where the tarheels were just kicking the crap out them.  It took one play to see that a major comeback was getting started.",bappypawedotter,2024-08-08T17:12:35,13
"I can also say that as a long time Biden supporter (I believed he was the ideal choice before he even announced he was running in 2020), that he was at the point where I couldn‚Äôt listen to him speak anymore. I wanted to believe right up until the announcement that he was the right candidate still, but I was probably a bit in denial. Witnessing leadership rally around Kamala Harris, hearing how  because she was a prosecutor that she had to have excellent oratory skills, was a breath of fresh air. While I still feel that she should have chosen a southern Democrat, her choice of Tim Walz is a smart choice. Even though he might be a little more of a progressive than some of the party centrists like, he had a middle class life in teaching before getting into politics, and can relate to Middle America in a way that a career politician can‚Äôt (just ask Hillary Clinton).",Thendsel,2024-08-08T17:07:50,11
"Easiest explanation.   There is more youth today voting than ever in history due to demographics. So swapping from the 80+ year old to a 50 something year old who is qualified for the job is a solid exciting pivot.   No one liked her? That is just propaganda. She has likely been one of the next candidates for a long while now. Democrats are the progressive party in politics, so conservatives enjoy doing anything in their power to discredit any up and coming stars in the opposition party.   They'll parrot out bullshit on talk radio, fox news channel, emails, and social media for their flock to repeat ad nauseum to those around them. **I had a step-father** myself who would listen to talk radio behind his family's back in the 90s-2000's and then try to pass off the talking points as his very own. Really he was just a tool in the propaganda machine that preyed on his insecurity, racism, and character defects. It brought out the very worst in him.  So the rest of us, not swept up 100% into that cult have been growing up and seeing conservatism for what it is. We are very resistant to their talking points that have bled our ears for over 30+ years. Conservative think tanks have been employing these tactics for a long time on any hopefuls or current leaders. I'll name their targets for you.  * Kamala Harris (Vice President and Presumptive Presidential Nominee)  * Gavin Newsom (California Governor) * Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (New York Congresswoman) * Nancy Pelosi (Ex Madam Speaker, Congresswoman) * Chuck Schumer (Senate Majority Leader)  The list goes on, but these are some common names that conservatives and their flock are trained to demonize and hate no matter what as a petty division strategy.",RobbyRyanDavis,2024-08-08T15:21:59,57

"Democrats come in two groups, *leadership* and *voters*. Both are facing the existential threat that is MAGA. Leadership took the safe approach. Biden is not an inspiring dude but he‚Äôs also plain enough to be low risk:  2020 - run the presumptive nominee (VP) 2024 - run the incumbent  So his voters were trapped between anyone but trump and rubber stamping the leaderships choice. Kamala is much more inspiring but was the risky choice. Because it‚Äôs still 2024. In 2028 the same rules that lead to Biden would have lead to her (and will lead to Tim 8 years from now).  But Biden‚Äôs health and the GOPs pressure on Biden‚Äôs health, made his staying on the high risk choice. Which lowered the relative risk of Kamala running instead. And with leadership out of the way, voters are able to hope again. To a degree I haven‚Äôt seen since Obamas first run.",ElectronGuru,2024-08-08T16:22:11,4

The VP isn't there to be very popular so they activity take a back seat. Now that Biden said he is having off this let's get really shine.

"I wasn‚Äôt excited about her before Biden withdrew, but this had everything to do with having spent the last 4 years ignoring her. She then came in with such confidence and made the best of those initial appearances, particularly in dismissing Trump, his degeneracy and his corruption ‚Äú[as a former prosecutor] I know his type‚Äù.  Frankly, she has the energy that Biden no longer had to sharply rebuke Trump, which is what so many have been hoping to see. Now, with Walz as her running mate, she has the happy warrior/attack dog who has the experience and political acumen to help her maintain this offensive. As a long-time progressive, I‚Äôm glad to finally see candidates with the ability to argue unapologetically about values that we share and are able and willing to attack the pathological nonsense of the MAGA cult(ire) that has consumed the right wing and GOP.

"I agree with what other commentators are saying about the stark difference between Kamala and Trump as candidates, but it's also worth pointing out the difference of strength behind their campaign finances. Trump has been using the RNC as a slush fund to fend off court expense after court expense instead of promoting his campaign.

"Kamala had the lowest approval rating of any VP. Her approval rating was worse than Biden. Many Dem leaders thought she dragged down the ticket this time around. Every situation Joe put her in charge he of she failed at. Prime example is the Southern Border.  However, Dems were so worried about losing the election after the Presidential Debate they had no choice but to force Biden out.   There are 2 main reasons they coronated her as the nominee (with 0 votes from voters).   1. The campaign cash Biden had on hand could only be transferred to Harris because she was on the original ticket. Anyone else would have to start from 0.  2. If the Dems had not given her the nomination (she did not earn it) they would have lost an important voting block.   They went around the democratic process of allowing the voters to choose their nominee and coronated her.

"Harris has really always been well-liked by most Democrats and liberals. She knocked it out of the park in every Judiciary Hearing. Her 2020 campaign struggled for a couple of reasons, partly due to a large field of candidates and partly she couldn't shake the ""Kamala is a cop"" thing. Interestingly, being a former prosecutor works heavily in her favor now when the other guy is a convicted felon.  Prior to Biden dropping out, there was far too much uncertainty about what would happen if he did. That's why so many voters (not necessarily party officials) wanted him to stay in. I was of the opinion that if Biden dropped, there was no other way to go but Harris.  I think her current popularity is what a lot of people have already said, she's young, she's not stumbling over words or struggling to complete sentences, and she's charismatic. She's also well-prepared for the role given her current job. While I did want Biden to stay in and I think concerns about his mental faculties are and were severely overblown, I'm just relieved that the in-fighting is over and we can move forward with a candidate. And I also think she'll be a great President.",SouthOfOz,2024-08-08T17:58:08,2
"The difference is a consequence of the way that the major parties pick their candidates vs the way that those parties actually compete in a general election.  As a primary candidate, Harris doesn't have a lot going for her.  She's slightly left of center in the Democratic Party, meaning that she's a bit more liberal than Biden but not nearly so progressive as Sanders.  She's a prosecutor which immediately puts her on the outs with the ""All Cops Are Bad"" crowd.  She's also been part of an administration that has been fairly supportive of Israel which puts her on the outs with the ""Gaza Genocide Is My Single Issue"" crowd.  Taken together, those things mean that Harris would have a hard time putting together a winning primary race.  If she was the only woman in the field or the only black candidate in the field she might pick up some voters on the strength of identity politics but most Democrats who wouldn't mind voting for Harris in a primary would find another candidate who's either much more progressive (Sanders) or more centrist (Biden).  In short, from a primary standpoint, she's like that Price Is Right contestant who gets sandwiched between two other bidders on the low and high end. It's not that she's staked out a bad position but that it's not an advantageous one.  But as a candidate in the general election, it's a completely different ballgame.  Harris, as VP, is the heir apparent in the party.  She's got stamps of approval from every living Democratic ex-President.  She's also on the Biden ticket so she has access to the funds the Biden campaign has already raised.  She's got fantastic name recognition.  She's a bi-racial (Black/Indian) woman so there's a ""historic"" angle to her candidacy.  But most importantly, that ""only slightly left of center"" bit really works in her favor as a general election candidate.  Realistically, most of her policies wouldn't be that different from Biden's but she is a _touch_ further to the left and that appeals to the Democratic base.    But, at the same time, she's not a LOT further to the left so when considered alongside other members of the Democratic Party she doesn't seem all that liberal.  That helps with her appeal to moderates.    Finally, however, she benefits from the goodwill accumulated by Biden by stepping down.  The 2024 election has been about two major messages up until very recently.  1. ""Democracy is on the ballot."" -- This is the Biden/Democratic message.  Essentially, ""Donald Trump already tried to coup the 2020 election and if you let him back into the White House that's it for the American experiment.""  2. ""Biden is very, very, very old. Also incompetent.  Also personally responsible for everything from global inflationary pressure to high gas prices.""  That's the Republican message and it has been the Republican message since 2020.  In stepping down, Biden dealt a mortal blow to message #2 while HEAVILY bolstering message #1.  It's tough to make the election about how old and senile Biden is when he's not running.  At the same time, by stepping down and voluntarily relinquishing any shot at a second term, Biden cast a profound contrast between the values of his administration and those of Trump.  And Harris, as part of his administration, both reflects those values and stands to inherit the good-will they garner.    So, by dropping out Biden simultaneously breathed new life into the Democratic ticket, stole Trump's thunder, and cemented his administration (and by extension, Harris) as like-unto Cincinatus or George Washington: willing to give up power (or at least a shot at power) for the Good Of The Republic.  Add on to that the fact that, with the passing of the torch to Harris, what was a contest between two very, very old men has turned into a generational battle (ok, Harris is technically a boomer but she's so close to the cutoff that Gen-X will claim her).  The rising tide of anti-boomerism thus also finds a cause in her.    So while few in the Democratic Party would have picked her as their favorite son (or daughter) in a primary, she's fairly popular as a nominee.",Killfile,2024-08-08T18:12:42,2

"people are starving for a stable, cognizant status quo. can we just go back to the pre trump era? she's going to continue the path of unlimited spending and government expansion, but at least she's not a self-styled authoritarian dictator or experiencing dementia.  fox critizes her for being dumb and i dont see it. her parents are both academics, she graduated law school, won election for attorney general in her state. she polled poorley during her 2019 campaign (i dont even remember her running) and before biden steped down i wasnt aware of her doing anything.  another criticism i disagree with is the whole ""boarder czar"" thing. i dont know all the details, so maybe someone can explain it to me. all i know is they say she was in charge of the boarder and the boarder is in crisis. crime is near historical lows and immigrants commit crime at lower rates than natural born americans, so a lot of that talk is delusional.   however, lets remember basic civics.  congress writes kaws, the executive carries them out, and SCOTUS interprets the laws. last year congress had finally reached a compromise on the boarder, republicans get funding for boarder patrol and democrats would get funding for ukraine and taiwan. so long as 10 republicans voted in favor, it would pass.  well, trump called up all the republicans he could and told them to vote against it. he needed the boarder crisis to continue ornhe might loose his biggest selling point and biden might claim it as a win. if Congress doesn't pass laws to help the situation, the executive doesnt have anything to carry out.  that said, there are criticisms i agree with. she went on the breakfast club and admitted to using cannabis, but as a prosecutor, she sent clountless men to prison for smoking weed. she ignored evidence that would expnerate prisoners because california needed reserve firefighters. and there are plenty of failures of the biden administration that she is tied to.   the second he was elected the whole ""kids in cages"" thing was dropped. biden initially expanded the program, though has since ended a lot of trump's title 42 restrictions when he declared the pandemic was over. he didnt do much to help student loan forgiveness either. afghanistan was a debacle and there is no reason for us to be getting involved in another war in ukraine after raking up billions of dollars in debt and ultimately just giving more power to the taliban. she might be a little more pro palestine than biden, but i dont expect much. trump is obviously worse on that issue anyway.",[deleted],2024-08-08T20:02:16,0

Not to mention her poor performance in the 2020 primaries.

"I‚Äôm a lifelong Minnesotan who has voted for Walz.

He decided to leave the MN NG to pursue politics before he completed those things. So, when he retired, he didn‚Äôt meet the requirements for that rank, and ended up retiring at his previous rank.   There was nothing nefarious about it. He DID achieve that rank, but ended up retiring one rank below due to unfinished ‚Äúred tape‚Äù.  As for his unit being activated to go to Iraq, that didn‚Äôt happen until several months after he retired, and the unit didn‚Äôt begin training for that deployment until another month or two after that, and the unit didn‚Äôt deploy until nearly a year after he retired.

"Inflation is going down. It has been since mid 2022 because the economy has been strong. Jobs have been up. Faith in the economy has been up. People are going out to eat, buying vehicles, etc. Inflation has to be lowered slowly otherwise bad things happen to the econony. Also, several studies have shown that the greatest cause for inflation is corporate greed and price hijacking. Additionally, supply chains are STILL recovering from disruptions caused by Covid.  Interest is the same story as inflation. The feds manage both to keep the economy stable. [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/fed-funds-rate-history/) does a great job explaining how the two are intertwined and the rates and reasons from 1990-2023.  Open borders itself isn't a bad thing. In addition to Democrats, Libertarians also vouch for free/open borders. It isn't solely an enforcement issue on our side-- which by the way there have been consistent numbers of [patrol agents](https://usafacts.org/data/topics/security-safety/crime-and-justice/homeland-security/border-patrol-agents/) since 2009 (+/- 2,000)-- it's other countries not caring about/controlling mass emmigration because of societal and violence issues. Mexico and Venezuela are great examples of this. Additionally, according to [Statistica](https://www.statista.com/statistics/191219/reported-violent-crime-rate-in-the-usa-since-1990/) (up until 2022) and the [FBI](https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/explorer/crime/crime-trend) (also up until 2022), crime rates spiked during Covid but have been in a downward trend, with the exception of a select few like property crimes and arson.  Loss of freedoms? Like what?  Again, high gas and groceries: corporate greed, shrinkflation, capitalism. Since Covid, companies have figured out that they can keep their prices as high as they want and most people will still buy. Historically, once prices on ANYTHING go up, they pretty much remain stable and never go back down (with gas prices being an exception because we have our own supply chain that we can control through import, export, stock, and release).   Endless wars? That's not a Democrat problem. That's not a Republican problem. That's not a Libertarian problem. While political groups approach wars in different ways, it's a WORLD problem. We are allies to MANY countries and not everyone likes to play nice. We have also been a mediator for a long time. It's suggested that since our founding, we have been at war 93% of the time, and have been listed in 108 conflicts, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_involving_the_United_States).",onelb_6oz,2024-08-08T23:03:02,3

He said, and it had context, that his first day he‚Äôll be like a dictator, reversing all Biden‚Äôs dumbass policies, EXACTLY like Biden did on day one of his term. Just like if you force the auto industry to be all electric, Trump said it would be a ‚Äúbloodbath of the auto industry‚Äù but nah, yall ran with the ‚Äúhe threatened a bloodbath when he gets in office‚Äù. üôÑ All nonsense, all lies and completely all propaganda.",Shonnah13,2024-08-08T22:29:02,3
