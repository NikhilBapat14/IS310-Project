"Around 6 on a Monday evening, Slate writer Shirin Ali found herself standing in a Marriott Hotel ballroom in Bridgewater, New Jersey, talking to a retired police chief about his newfound passion for protesting Donald Trump.  “Never been much of a protester, until Jan. 20,” Robert Quinlan told me. “I never in my lifetime thought that this could happen in America—that our democracy could really be in danger.”  Ali wanted to see for herself what kind of message the party was putting out there now, and how it was being received on the ground.

"My question is how many republicans attended the events and what their opinions were.  We have a quote from a retired police chief, but we don't know his political affiliation.  All this tells me is Dems are finally doing what we've been begging them to do from the start, but it's too little and probably too late.",ERedfieldh,2025-04-30T09:43:14,0
