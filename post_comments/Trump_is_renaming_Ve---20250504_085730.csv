"Trump’s is an egocentric ignorant view of WWII, celebrating himself through the sacrifice of American and other allied soldiers.    His love of authoritarianism would have definitely put him on the Nazi's side like Charles Lindbergh.       The American sacrifice in WWII was massive, but beyond it the wider picture was Russian soldiers (not their leaders) spilled the most blood to end World War II before D-Day.   20 million Russian soldiers dead. \[No fan of Stalin or Putin just history\]       The UK then was also an essential bulwark that held the line, both as an eventual Island base for the USA near Europe, and using up its final power of British Empire with its commonwealth of countries, Indian, Australian, etc.  Trump is no patriot, no supporter of Vets.",True_Paper_3830,2025-05-04T09:28:57,4
"I've no doubt Vonnegut made a good case for that. I'll find it and read it. It does ignore the reality of mankind though, that sometimes war is necessary against extreme evils e.g. Nazis, or Putin now. Veterans day celebrates those who fought for democracy, but, yes, wars since WW1, and including WW1,  have also often also been waste, neglect for soldiers thrown into conflict, based on imperialism or a bad advance into frontiers with communities that exist with different values. It's not an easy choice to frame what is being celebrated but it mainly celebrates sacrifice by Vets for others.",True_Paper_3830,2025-05-04T18:35:59,1
