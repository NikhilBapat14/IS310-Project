"Is it constitutionally / legally possible?  Sure - these are positions created in offices (whether it's the President's or Congressional or whatever) is able to change and hire to/from as needed.   Functionally is it possible?  Probably not. In major offices, like the White House or big Senate offices, they're both full-time jobs (arguably both actually requiring more time than the average full-time job). And have some overlapping but ultimately pretty different skill sets.  That being said, yes sometimes in smaller offices or teams - you'll have the Chief of Staff double-hatting in another capacity (though unlikely the Press Secretary - while the Press Secretary is often the most visible member of the communications teams, it's actually usually the Communications Director in most offices that is the most senior comms staff - though obviously again, in very small teams, it's often the same person)",PhiloPhocion,2022-10-30T10:41:08,20
"Those are both ""made up"" positions in the Executive branch, so yes. It would be a lot of work (assuming they keep the same responsibilities) but it can be done.",ProLifePanda,2022-10-30T10:22:41,6
"I think you need to be a little bit more specific with your question. When you say ""press secretary and chief of staff of the US"", are you referring to the White House press secretary and chief of staff? In that case the answer is probably no. The chief of staff has a lot of responsibilities managing the personnel of the White House and it wouldn't make a whole lot of sense to add dealing with the press on top of it. It might make sense for a member of Congress though.",PaleontologistOk7794,2022-10-30T10:30:41,2
"Yeah sure, but the workload and stress of either one of those jobs is enough to kill you so I wouldn't reccomend it.   Source: I worked in government. CoS often does more work than the politician they work for",notpoleonbonaparte,2022-10-30T10:50:32,2
Iâ€™d assume that takes too much work. Press secretary alone is a really hard job,mt-egypt,2022-10-30T13:22:21,1
Practically no. A Chief of Staff is too busy for a second position. But I'm unsure if there's a formal rule against it.,DMFC593,2022-10-30T17:00:29,1
No human could do both jobs at once.  There aren't enough hours in the day.,JohnOliverismysexgod,2022-10-30T19:11:02,1
