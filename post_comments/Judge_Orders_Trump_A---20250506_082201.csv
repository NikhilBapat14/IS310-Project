Did I miss something? WE have NO obligation to admit refugees or any kind. It is NOT a RIGHT just because you don't want to fix your own country.,ComputerRedneck,2025-05-06T09:57:13,58
Hell no. These judges need to be stopped. Everything President Trump does is stopped by activist judges.   Give every single one of them a due process trial. And the administration can appeal if they are granted access. And not a single one of them can be admitted until all trials are completed. ,Long_Jelly_9557,2025-05-06T10:07:20,15
"> The order from U.S. District Judge Jamal Whitehead followed arguments from the Justice Department and refugee resettlement agencies over how to interpret a federal appeals court ruling that significantly narrowed an earlier decision from Whitehead.  Tell me where it says that Whitehead is an immigration judge. I’ll wait.  Once again, another activist judge trying to do activist judge things by overreaching into jurisdiction they don’t have. Disbar and ban him. The bill limiting the power of these morons can’t come soon enough.",Ok-Willow-4232,2025-05-06T08:28:08,78
Fuck this anti American judges.,krazyellinas23,2025-05-06T12:01:46,6
"During a hearing last week, the administration said it should only have to process 160 refugees into the country and that it would likely appeal any order requiring it to admit thousands. But the judge dismissed the government's analysis, saying it required ""not just reading between the lines"" of the 9th Circuit's ruling, ""but hallucinating new text that simply is not there.""  The judge is not following law but is an activist, although he should be removed from office by proper means, he will be completely reversed on appeal. These loons can’t help themselves.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-05-06T08:54:54,19

This is about the elite and it's minions being unable to accept that the people voted for the candidate they did not approve of.  They are blinded by hatred for the simple idea that the people don't know what is best for them.,letmeinfornow,2025-05-06T11:10:39,3

All of these late 1900s programs are shortsighted bullshit. America's quality of life has gone down the drain since then for most Americans.,kaytin911,2025-05-06T10:39:28,1
Yeah. You missed the part where the courts are infested by leftist activists that Obama and Schumer put there to destroy the country and establish one party rule,StratTeleBender,2025-05-06T10:23:24,28
"If the 9th Circuit feels that ""the administration was likely to win the case given the president's broad authority to determine who is allowed to enter the country"" they should vacate Whitehead's ruling altogether.",social_dinosaur,2025-05-06T09:01:22,24
Yep. I'm really near the point where I'd support Trump ignoring these courts all together!,jeepgrl50,2025-05-06T12:47:26,2
Step 1: the media says they were right and he really is orange Hitler ignoring the rule of law.  Step 2: Democrats draft articles of impeachment.  Step 3: swamp creatures on the right try to out-romney each other.  Step 4: the media circus blows up.  Step 5: scotus sides with the POTUS and the media ignores it.,Shadeylark,2025-05-06T11:18:48,8
"""Now let them enforce it""  The judges can say whatever they want. Trump can ignore it. And then let the impeachment process play out. But it's pretty scary that this is where we're at as a country. Forced illegal immigration to the point that the sitting president has to dare Congress to impeach him just for enforcing the very laws that Congress passed",StratTeleBender,2025-05-06T10:25:13,10
No I didn't miss that part.  Been quite aware and they infestation goes back long before Obama. It was started at least in the 60's but done off and on since the beginning of the US.,ComputerRedneck,2025-05-06T10:33:09,13
"The 9th circuit oversees the courts in Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington: almost all of which are blue states. They’re more than likely going to uphold his ruling as the 9th circuit panel is left leaning themselves, so this is going to have to go all the way to SCOTUS.",Ok-Willow-4232,2025-05-06T09:03:49,12

"I have little faith in the 9th and was surprised that they narrowed Whitehead's decision to begin with. But you're right, this will be yet another case on SCOTUS' ever-growing docket this year.",social_dinosaur,2025-05-06T09:18:38,10
