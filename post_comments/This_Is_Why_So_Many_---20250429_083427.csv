"Excerpt:  >Several of the recent high-profile cases of immigrant detention share something in common. The Columbia University activist [Mahmoud Khalil,](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/16/nyregion/mahmoud-khalil-columbia-university.html) University of Alabama engineering doctoral candidate [Alireza Doroudi,](https://abc3340.com/news/local/attorney-says-university-of-alabama-student-alireza-doroudi-denied-bond-faces-deportation-april-2025-us-immigration-and-customs-enforcement) Tufts graduate student [Rumeysa Ozturk](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/us/ice-tufts-student-detained-rumeysa-ozturk.html) and young scientist [Kseniia Petrova](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/science/russian-scientist-ice-detained-harvard.html) were all rounded up in their respective states and sent to detention centers here in Louisiana.  >It is no coincidence that they all were sent to the same state — a place where they are far from their families, communities and legal counsel. Louisiana has for years been part of America’s epicenter of immigrant detention, and the second Trump administration is using the state to its advantage in its effort to strip immigrants of their rights and to do so in a way that is largely hidden from public view.  >Our state boasts nine immigration and customs enforcement detention centers, including a staging facility, with a capacity to hold more than 7,000 people, second only to Texas in the number of beds assigned to the task. Like Mr. Khalil, Mr. Doroudi, Ms. Ozturk and Ms. Petrova, [thousands](https://www.hrw.org/report/2009/12/02/locked-far-away/transfer-immigrants-remote-detention-centers-united-states) of immigrants arrested around the country have been transferred to these Louisiana jails in recent decades.  >Louisiana is notorious for a trifecta of compounding barriers to effectuate the rights of immigrants: conservative courts, scarce access to legal support and horrific [detention](https://www.wbur.org/news/2025/04/10/ozturk-louisiana-ice-detention-conditions-trump) conditions. The resulting “black hole,” as civil and human rights groups have called it, threatens to erode America’s rule of law well beyond the immigration legal system.",Naurgul,2025-04-29T08:35:46,22
"I had been wondering why so many immigrants were sent to Louisiana. Now I know the details. There is a giant ""legal black hole"" for immigrants.  >Even those who secure a lawyer often have trouble arranging legal visits and phone calls. And according to one lawsuit, immigration and jail officials interrupted attorney-client visits, intimidated lawyers, trapped them for hours inside a facility and followed them off the property.  Louisiana detention centers are clearly our version of CECOT.  >The conditions in Louisiana immigration facilities are punishing. A great majority of immigrant detention centers in Louisiana, as is the case nationally, are run by private corporations intent on turning profits. A 2024 report by the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights organization documented a litany of abuses, from brown water and food infested with maggots to sexual assault, liberal use of tear gas and dozens of instances of denied medical care. Those who complained faced retaliation, including months of solitary confinement.  >These conditions have contributed to the deaths of eight people detained in Louisiana in the past five years, according to the same report. Some scholars and advocates have speculated that these conditions are meant to deter people from pursuing their legal claims to remain in the United States, forcing them to give up, even when facing possible violence in the country to which they would be deported.",sachiprecious,2025-04-29T09:19:37,10

"It makes sense that a state connected with southern slavery, would continue the tradition to this day. They treat these people as subhuman, and the White supremacist in the White house is more than happy to allow them to continue doing it.",FreshRest4945,2025-04-29T09:12:35,15
