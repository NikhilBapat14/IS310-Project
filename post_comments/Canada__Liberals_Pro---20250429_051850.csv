I wonder if he would have lost if trump didn’t try the tariffs on Canada.,dotsdavid,2025-04-29T09:30:24,121
Nice job Trump.   God help Canada.,Vessarionovich,2025-04-29T06:34:09,224
"Canada, you can only blame yourself. You watched as carney got 2/3ds of the votes in the party disqualified. And got 2 of his opponents DQd. You saw him boast about selling out to china despite their large tarrifs against you and openly hostile relationship. You heard him proudly brag about reducing quality of life in canada to that of a 3rd world country.   Trump didnt make you vote for this guy, poilievre isnt pro trump, yet you still chose the same party that has raveged your rights and your country, and managed to chose a guy who proudly declares he wants to turn canada into a third world country.   To all not crazy canadians, good luck, youre going to need it living with so many deranged individuals.",ultrainstict,2025-04-29T07:55:55,60

"Trump knows what he did too, he just bragged to the Atlantic about blowing the Conservatives 25  point lead. So freaking frustrating.",AccidentProneSam,2025-04-29T07:17:34,168
"Canada had the chance not to shotgun blast themselves in the face. They failed.  To hell with what Trump says, they get what they deserve.",TheThunderOfYourLife,2025-04-29T10:58:14,-24
It’s pretty undeniable that once Trump started the 51st state shit and the trade war that the conservatives lead in all polls dropped off a cliff.   I don’t know what to tell you if you seriously think Trump had little to no effect on this election. It’s just not true.,EliteJassassin101,2025-04-29T08:37:55,261
