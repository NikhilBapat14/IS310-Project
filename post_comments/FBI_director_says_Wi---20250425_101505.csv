Glad to know the FBI has failed the American public as usual.,Bad_Habit_Nun,2025-04-25T10:16:40,43
"So glad they are getting dangerous criminals ruining Americans’ lives off the streets. People like a student peacefully protesting and a Judge doing her constitutional duties. I feel so much safer!! Meanwhile, a literal rapist is president and a Russian asset runs our intelligence agencies",susibirb,2025-04-25T10:25:10,15

"> “We believe Judge Dugan intentionally misdirected federal agents away from the subject to be arrested in her courthouse, Eduardo Flores Ruiz, allowing the subject — an illegal alien — to evade arrest.”  Really, this is just... unbelievable. It's one thing to be concerned about holding people accountable, but something else entirely to weaponize the justice system against anyone who challenges the administration's priorities. It creates such a chilling effect, what message are we sending to our judges, to our legal professionals, when they're potentially facing legal action for simply doing their jobs? It's really upsetting, because it feels like such a clear-cut case of political pressure, don't you think? It's scary, to be honest... and the question remains, what protections do we have, what recourse do we have, when elected officials try to manipulate the legal process for their own purposes?",Tremenda-Carucha,2025-04-25T10:30:19,12
