We did the cost benefit analysis on this during the Cold War and the numbers just do not work in our favor.¬†  Even if you just defend the densely populated areas with your important industry, the numbers still suck.¬†  You need more defensive warheads than they have offensive warheads.¬†  But they can add cheap decoys to the mix, which you may struggle to identify, so you have to add more defensive warheads heads to the mix.¬†  Your defensive warheads are probably more expensive than their decoys.¬†  And god forbid you need multiple systems to cover everything you want to defend, because then your costs skyrocket even more.¬†",aaprillaman,2025-04-22T20:47:56,2
"TLDR [‚ÄãPresident Trump has proposed a new missile defense initiative called the ""Golden Dome,"" aiming to protect the U.S. from missile threats, particularly intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) from adversaries like Russia and China. Unlike Israel's Iron Dome, which is effective against short-range rockets, the Golden Dome would involve space-based interceptors designed to neutralize longer-range threats. ‚Äã The plan includes deploying a network of satellites equipped with advanced tracking and interception capabilities. While some defense companies have shown interest in participating, experts are divided on the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of such a system. Critics point out the technical challenges and potential for escalating an arms race in space. ‚Äã The Golden Dome concept is still in the early stages, with the Pentagon exploring various options and assessing the practicality of implementing a space-based missile defense system. The initiative reflects a significant shift in U.S. defense strategy, emphasizing the need to address emerging threats through advanced technological solutions.](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/22/g-s1-61658/trump-golden-dome-america-iron-military-defense)",Drtardis95,2025-04-22T19:11:12,1

"We have been robustly funding ($20B/yr?) the strategic defense initiative for over 30 years.  Several of the defense contractors have developed a deep, deep understanding of the issues involved.  All the solvable problems are solved.    Trump wants to abandon all that and fund Musk?  And Musk says he can do it in a couple of years?  And all the Republicans in Congress are Ok with this?  (Remember, these are the folks that have been funding the SDI for decades. They know what is possible.)  So what, Trump is going to drop $100B of our money into Musk‚Äôs pocket, he‚Äôs going to do some senseless dog and pony show, then say ‚Äúoops, I was just kidding‚Äù in three years?
