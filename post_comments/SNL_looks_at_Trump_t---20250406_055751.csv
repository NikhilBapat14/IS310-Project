"Meh.  I'm over SNL's toothless political satire.  This chaos is thanks to Lorne's establishment cowardice.  Give me Sarah Sherman's dark absurdism anytime, but I'm skipping these now.  I've lost my respect for Lorne Michaels, who I think is one of the best in terms of respecting his crew.  He sets the standard for supporting employees, but he failed as an American citizen and I'd really like to tell him that personally.",Apprehensive-Fun4181,2025-04-06T09:36:56,1
