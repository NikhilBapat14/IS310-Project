"The USA is missing a huge opportunity. The country has a ready supply of cheap labor at its borders, just waiting for the opportunity to work. It could institute a migrant labor minimum wage and taxation system, and double the $100 billion that immigrants contribute annually in taxes. But instead, we have a short-sighted, racist authoritarian in office.",JFJinCO,2025-05-02T10:02:38,7

"100% this.  The GOP does not argue in good faith on this topic.  Everything hinges on their status being illegal so that they can get votes.  Instead of looking for healthy ways to deal with it, they use it as meat for their base.  Truly disgusting.",boops_the_snoots,2025-05-02T10:06:25,3
