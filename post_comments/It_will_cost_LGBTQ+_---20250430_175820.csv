That isn't a negative for them.  Here's what people aren't getting Trump's admin does not see non straight non white and probably non Christians as people and preferably those Christians are evangelicals.

"they aren't gambling. they are straight up encouraging certain classes of people to self-terminate, just like they are encouraging immigrants to self-deport. it's easier to get rid of undesirables by convincing them to get rid of themselves. every gay kid that offs himself is one less for the camps to deal with.",PhilOfTheRightNow,2025-04-30T21:51:16,4

Genocide? Trans aren‚Äôt a race,Relevant-Tax-2414,2025-04-30T22:54:54,-17
Well genocide IS a very heavy term with very heavy implications and therefore shouldn't be used lightly nor quickly.   But then again that's what I said¬† about people accusing Israel of genocide in the Gaza war.,LocustMajor9128,2025-05-01T06:17:56,1
"While traditionally the term genocide applies to religious, racial or ethnic groups, scholars have coined the term ‚Äútransgender genocide‚Äù to describe the hostile legislation and treatment of trans people which aims to fully eliminate them from public life. The government is getting rid of all the support and accommodations for trans people because they hope we will kill ourselves. That‚Äôs what they want. They‚Äôre trying to make it impossible for trans people to exist.",EllipticPeach,2025-05-01T07:27:37,5

"The word ""genocide"" was¬†coined in the early 1940s by Raphael Lemkin, a Polish-Jewish lawyer.¬†He combined the Greek word ""genos"" (meaning ""race"" or ""people"") with the Latin suffix ""-cide"" (meaning ""killing"") to describe the systematic destruction of groups, particularly during the¬†Holocaust.¬†Lemkin's work led to the recognition of genocide as a crime under international law.¬†  We are a people.  Jewish is a religion, but we all know Hitler attempted genocide.",TwilightBubble,2025-05-01T15:12:36,1

"Elimination of a spiritual belief or community and culture is wrong.  Genes weren't discovered when the geno prefix was created.  It's not blood, it's brotherhood.  It's a culture,  a thriving community,  my life, my friends,  my family.",TwilightBubble,2025-05-02T01:45:28,2
