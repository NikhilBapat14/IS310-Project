"> Literally almost every other state does not have that issue.  Well, to begin with, that isn't true. There are lots of other states that have this issue--California, for example, which has the most voters by far, can sometimes take weeks to count. Alaska builds in extra time after election day to make sure absentee ballots can travel long distances. But their state-wide elections are rarely competitive enough that those races can't be called early. Nevada's problem is that it's a competitive state.  [This article](https://archive.ph/Ty13U) goes deeper into Nevada-specific problems, but the short answer is that Nevada accepts mail-in ballots for several days after the election, as long as they were postmarked by election day. During the pandemic, the state changed their laws to require mail-in ballots sent to every registered voter. This has meant a big rise in mail-in ballots to be processed, without necessarily an increase in the ability to process those ballots.",anneoftheisland,2022-11-15T00:34:50,4
"Two big reasons  1) The state has many close elections. Blowout elections can be called fast. If someone’s lead is greater than the amount of unread ballots, they’ve basically won.   2) The increased popularity of vote-by-mail, and people who turn in mail-in ballots at the last minute. Ballots post marked on Election Day are still valid, but they need to be counted in the days after the election because they don’t arrive instantly.",GhostalMedia,2022-11-15T00:37:39,3
"There are several states that are still counting votes. About a third of CA's votes remain uncalled, with many districts still only reporting around 60% of votes counted. CO has at least one race outstanding, as does AK and ME.   The difference is that NV is the only state here that is very close in many races, and so of course it will take longer because literally every vote matters. In ME we're pretty darn sure that the Dem will win, and most of CA is figured out because the state isn't very swingy. NV had lots of races take longer because they were down to the wire.",mormagils,2022-11-15T08:35:12,2
