"A few possibilities:  1. General anti-war sentiment/isolationism. If you're on the fringe-left, support for Ukraine might look like an excuse to pump money into the military industrial complex and perpetuate war. On the right one might see it as wasting resources on something that isn't obviously in the national interest.  2. Skepticism of ""the establishment""; which I'll define here as career politicians (e.g. senior congressional leaders + well known centrist figures from both parties) and experienced civil servants. This is something that's common on both the far-left and far-right, which you can see for things like vaccine skepticism and yes, belief in certain conspiracy theories. As financial support for Ukraine is something supported by both the center-left and center-right establishment, certain people on the fringes will naturally be skeptical. As an aside, I think the invasion of Iraq (and to a lesser extent Afghanistan) really damaged the credibility of US foreign policy institutions (think CIA, DoD, and associated think tanks/individuals) in a way that they haven't quite recovered from. 3. I think support for NATO is also more divided along fringe/centrist lines as opposed to party lines. Trump's presidency did weird things here, like make the right softer on Russia and likely add more conservatives to the anti-NATO camp (though to be clear most congressmen on the center-right still support NATO).  4. To your last question, I think some of this is recasting the war in Ukraine as a ""proxy war"" between the US and Russia, in a way that removes moral responsibility for the war from Russia and presents the US and Russia as approximately equally culpable. I'm not sure how much of this is actually done in good faith...",tranlinn,2022-12-27T15:16:38,19
"The right does seem to be opposed simply because it's the mainstream position, and that's pretty frustrating, even coming from a place of understanding that the mainstream news items are usually pretty heavy on the spin.   I've recognized a similar enclave on the left OP, but identified it a little differently. I think it's similar to the crowd that is opposed just because the Democrats support it, except not divided on party lines. The left wingers I see opposed to supporting Ukraine is more like the ""america bad"" crowd from what I can tell. The folks who figure everything America does is somehow evil. Sure, there's a long list of shitty things, but there is a certain crowd that is convinced that the world really is that black and white. If America supports Ukraine, this Putin guy has probably got a perfectly good justification. If America supports Taiwan, then Taiwan must be rightful communist clay. That sort of thing. You've probably run into the folks I'm talking about on some corner of the internet. Real tiring.   On a side note, Ukraine is why the pullout from Afghanistan matters. Because there are actors in the world that are waiting for the West to pull back and disengage. To lose interest in maintaining the Liberal world order. Putin miscalculated. We aren't done. But it's something we must be vigilant on. We don't live in a perfect world. We can only work to make it the best we can. Sometimes violence is required.",notpoleonbonaparte,2022-12-27T20:14:49,8
"The one thing I'd keep in mind before getting into this is there's a solid amount of astroturfing going on. If you dig into some of these accounts you find they're fairly new and they're laser focused on anti-NATO talking points, anti-Ukraine talking points, or flat out pro-Russia talking points. I'm not saying people can't have a personal cause but the number of social media accounts that have taken up a nominally pro-Russia stance while being ostensibly leftist since 2014 is...unusually high.  >For folks who either support Russia's invasion of Ukraine, or simply don't support any US efforts to support Ukraine's defense against Russia, how is it that some left and right wing folks agree on this? Where is it coming from?  On the left you have a solid suspicion of NATO as it's seen as effectively an arm of US influence (which I actually don't wholly disagree with.) These individuals frame the conflict as a proxy war, using Ukrainians to fight against the Russians to break down Russia.   On the right there's a persistent belief that Russia somehow signifies a sort of righteous stand  of conservative values against liberalism and the encroachment of Islam. Note that this is based almost entirely on a *feeling* rather than on concrete policies supporters can point to.   Both of them have a bridge because they see the US/Western influence as being shoved into Ukraine by the US and Russia as taking a stand against it. The unifying factor is standing against the liberal West in some way.  >Is there a connection between opposing Ukraine and being susceptible to conspiracy theories, religious/spiritual thinking, or simply anti-government sentiment?  Yes-ish?  *A lot* of the Ukraine smear stories that have come out over the last year have traded heavily on conspiracy theories or have come from questionable places. There was a wing of QAnon that was focused pretty heavily on the idea that Ukraine had secret biological weapons labs and that that's where COVID was produced.   On the left more specifically, there's a tendency to have an extremely blinkered view of the US in that *anything* the US does for *any* reason is automatically bad and should be opposed. This is popular with the tankie/authcom crowd but there's an inability to see any depth in a situation past US involvement.  >How does NATO factor into this? Is supporting/opposing NATO usually divided along party lines, or is it more complicated?  NATO is seen as a de facto extension of US influence. The real story is obviously more complicated than that but the general idea is that NATO effectively belongs to the US.  >Many of these folks use catchphrases like ""End the war in Ukraine"" to get people to oppose US support of Ukraine against Russia. From my perspective, Russia invaded Ukraine, so ""ending the war"" just means letting Russia invade and annex its neighbors, right? Are they explicitly supporting Russian imperialism and hoping the rest of us don't notice?  Uhhh yeah, basically. It's not imperialism though, according to them. For some reason. I've never gotten a clear answer on that.   The logic is *generally* that Russia is responding to NATO encroachment or nebulously defined aggression from Ukraine, thus it isn't imperialism.",HeloRising,2022-12-28T12:41:24,4

"This is a form of isolationism, IMO.    There is a small but strong isolationist tendency in the US that transcends the left/right categorization.  Basically, the belief that we should take care of things here at home instead of involving ourselves overseas has more appeal to others.    It especially appeals to those who do not understand the economic benefits we reap from our overseas . . . interests (aka ""empire"") including not least the fact that the dollar remains the reserve currency of the world and as a result is the defacto if not de jure base currency for most of the worlds large financial transactions.  That's not to say there are downsides to empire and reserve currency status, but the isolationists tend to magnify the negatives and ignore the positives.",phreeeman,2022-12-27T17:58:52,3

Multifactorial. You've got your classic tankies and the fascists who bump into each other walking backwards on the political horseshoe. You've got the contrarians and conspiracy nuts. You've got those who've just been burnt in the past by the West/USA/UK and sadly have no attachment to reality outside their now blinkered view. You've got those who've been financially compromised. You've got those who are just selfish and see no moral case to help anyone other than themselves (although ignoring Russia will backfire stupendously). Then I guess a sprinkling of low information or low intelligence actors who simply don't know what's going on and are easily manipulated. Often it's a mix of these things and in some cases all of these things.,hungoverseal,2022-12-27T17:25:27,6
"Is it people ""not supporting defense against Russia"" or is it people who don't believe the US should be providing 95% of it through some kind of psudeo proxy war which is at risk for escalation?

It’s because they oppose war. They see it as a war by capitalists and the military industrial complex to make money and believe Ukraine to be fascist.  That’s what the far left believes,96suluman,2022-12-27T17:01:36,0

I am not against giving aid to Ukraine. And fwiw I am right of most redditors. But two thing bug me a-bit when we give aid.   1.  EU should be giving a lot more than the US.  I know they shoulder costs like refugees and energy prices.  But this is a war in their backyard.  They should  be giving much much more.    2. Afaik there are groups in Ukraine who are ok with the war simply being over even if it means they lose some territory.  But for too many Americans we don’t consider their lives the same way. We don’t experience the loss of war personally so its  a bit  more idealogical than pragmatic.   It’s either all or nothing.,Whiterabbit--,2022-12-27T22:37:58,1
"tranlinn mentions some of it (specifically that this is a proxy war and that the US is motivated more to keep Russia down and feed the Military Industrial Political complex than to help Ukraine citizens) but there's a lot more.  First off, I consider supporting Ukrainians to include doing all we can to stop the death and destruction. As of November we were looking at 100k casualties on each side of the conflict. Countless have been displaced, are left without power, etc. So you must first ask, what specific goals could be accomplished by refusing negotiations now rather than later? What are you hoping to get, specifically, that wouldn't be on the table. Even Kissinger is advocating for a cease-fire at this point.  I feel like a lot of rhetoric around pushing for more bloodshed is that Ukrainian culture was fundamentally different and far worse prior to the Maidan Revolution/Coup. But the way I see it, Ukraine just went from being a puppet state for Russia to a puppet state for US/NATO, and returning to the prior status quo there was prior to Euromaidan doesn't necessarily seem like the end of the world. America wants to lead a monopolar world in perpetuity, but at some point I think we need to recognize the My Way Or The Highway approach isn't the best for humanity long term - power will need to be shared. Inequality will need to be reduced, rather than continuing the process of consolidating power.  I know the Ukrainian government was corrupt before, but it's not like a revolution dependent on a far right false-flag sniper attack where fascists shoot innocents and blame it on police is the sort of revolution that leads to Happily Ever After. While I don't want to overplay the fascism card (it's not like fascism was an actual motivation for Putin's invasion), it's not not worth discussing how fascist groups don't unbecome fascist once they're made part of the state military. Banning all left wing political parties post-invasion was certainly a decision as well.  Speaking of motivations, this is still the best vid I've found regarding what Russia's motivations are . TL;DR it's their natural gas and restoring the defensive bottleneck between them and NATO.  There's so so so so much more to talk about to, but this is maybe enough of a start, and I'll share more if folks take genuine interest. I also thought this redditor may have answered this more eloquently than I.  It's important to remember that we're being propagandized as much as people in any other country. The mainstream narrative, while built on aspects of truth also leaves out details which are relevant to what exactly is going on. Just one example, the news was for months trying to convince folks that Russia blew up their own pipeline (cuz Putin is CrAzY) even though Biden literally threatened to blow it up if Russia invaded.

"So for me, pretty far left, I support Ukraines right to enforce their internationally recognized borders, including crimes and think that Russia is squarely in the wrong here. However, I even more adamantly believe that the USA is not the world police and it should not be our job to fund the resistance or deploy troops. Not because we don’t bear any responsibility or fear their next step, but because when it comes from a single adversary, it can be seen and portrayed as bullying more easily. Coming from a unified coalition is less us vs them and more you’ve gone against the entire world and there are consequences.  I do think the UN should have the ability and a mechanism to brand member countries as acting outside the interests of the UN, nullifying any powers the country has in the day of actions the UN can take, and that all UN members should have soldiers assigned to its control and the UN should deploy troops as a United front. They should be able to call for more troops from all member countries as needed as well. And I think that instead of the Patriot missiles and foreign aid coming from the US, it should come from the UN.
