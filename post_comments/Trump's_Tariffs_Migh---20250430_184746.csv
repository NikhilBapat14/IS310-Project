"Honestly, good. I’m excited for this. Make it so painfully obvious how the common American is getting screwed that they have no choice but to dislike Trump. Let his approval ratings sink.

"Assuming there are some tactics and long term positions here.  trump gets to be as terrible as possible in advancing his terrible agenda  If he dies in office , gets impeached, 25th amendmented etc etc..   He will still have done all the damage he could and the lawlessness and destruction to our infrastructure will take years to undo.  This also assumes that world will just go back to "" business as usual "" with the US once Trump and his MAGA people are gone.   Given the US military and our geographic isolation from Europe and Asia  The best tactics for other nations are to call in all US debt and simply don't trade with the US anymore.   trump is Going to destroy so many people''s lives over this Stunt with our federal government",RobbyRock75,2025-04-30T19:25:06,6

"That's already a fact. In case you didn't know it: manufacturers are busy with the next holiday season roughly from Jan 2nd. Any kind of interruption in the supply chain pretty much guarantees that deadlines will not be met and that things that should be on the shelves in October will simply not be there. Either because they are still in transit or because they simply were never manufactured because it is pointless ending up with a whole raft of unsold last years inventory. And that's before we get into the tandem act between marketing and manufacturing, that needs to stay in sync or you will be spending a whole bunch of budget for stuff you end up not having.      Messing with this machine will cause retailers to go under: those last weeks of the year are the difference between profitability and loss for quite a few companies.",HorrorStudio8618,2025-04-30T20:47:18,2

"You realize that there is a studied, and defined difference in how brains work for people when it comes to political identity and empathy right?  On average people who are more liberal are measurably more aware of what’s going on in the world as well as having the ability to empathize with other people who are different.   Conservatives are found to have the part of their brains that activate for fear and anxiety more often and show less ability to empathize.   The only way to get a good handful of conservatives to comprehend the reality of the situation is to let to drive home to them too. What’s wrong?",ACasualRead,2025-05-01T18:11:28,2
