"I would call $300,000,000 to pay local law enforcement so Trump can go golfing wasteful spending. That is what is in the Republicans FEMA budget in the upcoming bill. If this motherfucker wants to golf he should pay for it himself.  If he truly cared about saving our money, he would forego golfing to save us that money.    Or maybe pay for it himself with all that illegal trump crypto coin proceeds.",Hungry-External-7812,2025-05-02T18:47:24,1
