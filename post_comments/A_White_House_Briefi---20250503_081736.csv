"I now fully expect Trump to use his West Point commencement address to announce his new [""Bigger Hats"" policy](https://static.politico.com/14/bb/cbacddd74273a8972b596d8c306a/180614-trump-salute-screengrab-1160.png) for the military.",specqq,2025-05-03T08:21:27,17
"“Remember when Fox News was the biggest Trump cheerleader in town?” Helen Lewis asks. “Those days are gone.”  White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has begun holding dedicated press briefings for MAGA-friendly influencers. These new-media briefings are part of the Trump administration’s attempt to formalize the network of friendly commentators and influencers who have prospered online. The plan, Lewis writes, “appears to be to secure the loyalty of these attention-hungry narcissists by setting them against one another, in a kind of sycophancy ‘Hunger Games,’ as they compete for access through ever greater acts of devotion and flattery.”   These briefings are also an extension of the White House’s existing efforts to soften up the press pool by adding more friendly faces. On April 22, for instance, Leavitt called upon Tim Pool, who, the Justice Department asserted last year, was among a group of conservative commentators that unwittingly received large sums from Russian agents eager to stoke American culture-war controversies. In addition to relitigating coverage over events such as the 2017 white-supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, Pool wanted Leavitt to issue a wider condemnation of the traditional media. At another briefing, one of the “questions” was a suggestion that the White House should sue Fox News for putting out an opinion poll that showed Trump “in a less than flattering light,” Lewis explains.  The influencers in attendance, “who complain so much about the hated mainstream media, have immediately copied all of their rivals’ worst habits when given even the merest taste of access and power,” Lewis continues. “Then again, maybe even they know that the briefings are cringeworthy.”   Although the White House has reportedly claimed that it had 10,000 applications from new media to attend, two of the three briefings as of May 2 had empty seats. “I suspect that the MAGA crowd wants to be in the main briefing, where they can lord it over the traditional reporters—not in the kiddie pool,” Lewis writes. “Still, plenty of people find the chance to take a selfie in the Rose Garden irresistible.”  Read more: [https://theatln.tc/67H2Mn7q](https://theatln.tc/67H2Mn7q)   — Grace Buono, audience and engagement editor, *The Atlantic*",theatlantic,2025-05-03T08:17:52,6
"Americans when they see something happening Americanly in America: “what are we a bunch of ASIANS?”  I wish journalists would cover topics with more honesty. So often, I see headlines and comments like:  >A bill in Arkansas would ban gender affirming HAIRCUTS for transgender youth. HAIRCUTS. This is a straight up North Korea state sanctioned hairstyle proposed law for youth.  Like, is this really a ""north korea state sanctioned hairstyle proposed law"", or is it, perhaps, possibly, more accurately described as a ""arkansas, united states of america, sanctioned hairstyle proposed law"", as that is where it is taking place, as a result of political forces specific to that place and nation?  is guantánamo bay really 'america's gulag' or is it perhaps, 'america's guantánamo bay, the extrajudicial prison that the usa famously runs after imperialistic seizure. and so on. and so on.",combatconsulting,2025-05-03T09:51:09,4

"> conservative commentators that unwittingly received large sums from Russian agents  The word ""unwittingly"" is likely there only because it can't be proven exactly what the influencers themselves knew. But those influencers all trotted out pro-Russian narratives and spread misinformation to favour Russia, so it's my opinion that they did it entirely knowingly and willingly.",DaveChild,2025-05-03T08:35:36,9

"Interestingly, there is a very real extent to which the US bears responsibility for the “dictatorships” you mentioned. The US subverted the democratic process and sabotaged movements towards self-determination in both Iran (1950s) and Korea (1940s). I wonder what the world would look like if the US hadn’t done so.   Is it really just now, at this moment, that you think that the US has ascended to the “axis of evil” level that you referenced?   During what years would you describe American international politics “good” rather than the “evil” that you see under Trump? Because you refer to this moment as paradigm shift that “we get to live through…in real time.”",combatconsulting,2025-05-03T10:17:44,1
"I understand the point of the article, and I’m disheartened to hear of Trump’s new propaganda mouthpiece.   My contention, however, is that the way we perceive a problem can be itself part of a problem.  The article’s framing takes the focus off of the long history of Manufactured Consent in America, and it obfuscates our own history of propaganda. Instead, the title’s framing appeals to fear of the Other — that fear that “we” are becoming like “them”.   However, political forces specific to America and with more salient roots in American history created the problem that the article reports on. A nuanced analysis of the problem should reflexively locate its critique inward, rather than project outward.   I’d contend that the article’s myopic framing misses the point by failing to understand the scope of the problem.",combatconsulting,2025-05-03T14:20:52,2
