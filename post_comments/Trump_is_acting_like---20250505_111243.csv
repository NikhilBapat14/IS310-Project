The immunity granted by the Supreme Court extends to the president while doing official duties.  clearly, he could not be prosecuted for something like trying to cut funding to some agency since he would argue he was doing his job, and the courts would probably see it that way.  if he stole $1B in gold from Fort Knox, he would have a tougher time arguing ""official duties,"" though he would certainly try.  if he ordered Seal Team Six to assassinate a political rival, god knows what a court would decide.   2: As for upholding the constitution, that's an entirely different matter  TRUMP took an oath to do that.  however, breaking the oath would not be a crime as far as I know.  The remedy in this case would be impeachment.  in a properly working congress, that is what would happen.  however, it takes a majority of the house of impeach (i.e., accuse) and a majority of the senate to convict, and now that is so political that he would escape unless the balance were to shift in both chambers",SnooPuppers4031,2025-05-05T13:54:33,1

Even in last year's election cycle, I was still getting the ""Well, the course won't let him do X,"" or ""there's no way he would do X without getting sued."" The thing is, courts don't mean shit if you don't abide by their rulings.   There's only one way out of this for the American people, and with like 40+ % of the country supporting Trump and the GOP, I don't see that one solution happening. It's time for us all to start doing some planning and preparing, and stop with the wishful thinking. I hope we can make it to the 2026 elections, but I don't think they will be legit, so it probably doesn't matter.",cubanesis,2025-05-05T12:17:59,15
In practical terms what does that mean for every day Americans. We can protest all day and it does nothing but make us feel good for a few hours. It changes nothing when they no longer even have to care about votes. They aren't worried about elections. Elections are over. So what recourse do we actually have?,freakparty,2025-05-05T13:45:50,3
"This sentiment is great when it’s respected by all, but it’s actually not nearly as enforceable as it’s made out to be. When someone in power decides to go “fuck that”, it all becomes feel good nonsense.   I’m sure minorities felt this exact way over “all men are created equal” for much of our history. It sounds nice to say, but in practice, it means nothing unless everyone agrees to uphold the value.",fxghvbibiuvyc,2025-05-05T15:51:09,1
"The notion that power is derived from popular consent has always been a convenient fiction for the benefit of those wielding the power. It makes the ruled feel like they have some say in things, when in fact they have very little.  If power is derived from popular consent, then how do the people revoke their consent? And what is supposed to happen if they do? Those are both questions we’ve somehow never had to find the answer to in 250 years because in fact they rule us whether we like it or not. The truth is more along the lines of same Game of Thrones shit. “It’s a trick, a shadow on the wall” etc.",JackedUpReadyToGo,2025-05-05T19:02:54,1
Only if it's enforced. It's just words until then.,freakparty,2025-05-05T12:57:00,3

"Yep, the first time around he was surrounded by career professionals that mostly stopped him from doing things that are clearly illegal. The second time around, none of those people wanted to be around him anymore, so all he has now is psychotic sycophants. They’ll encourage him to do anything he wants and ignore the law when he feels like it. This outcome was pretty clear after Jan 6.",veryverythrowaway,2025-05-05T13:23:23,5
That is a really a good question bc the constitution doesn’t spell out a formal enforcement mechanism. Attending professionally organized protests is only one tactic within the toolbox of civil disobedience and civic engagement. Professional protests centralize risk for organizers and thus proactive compliance. The answer to your question will come in forms that we are not yet expecting. Exciting and ambiguous.,Braerian,2025-05-05T15:32:35,1
