"> Maybe something will happen, maybe it won't. It's not up to me.  That's some real leadership right there.",Grandpa_No,2025-04-28T10:49:15,24
"Saw this guy interviewed and he's so obviously out of his depth. He really sounded stupid, so I guess it doesn't take brains to be a hedge fund manager. This entire administration is clown shoes, the worst in the world aside from maybe Iraq, North Korea or some African basket case.",oculeers,2025-04-28T10:51:51,8
The President of the United States can’t get his phone calls returned. He had to corner Zelensky at the Pope’s funeral.,ranchoparksteve,2025-04-28T11:04:01,7
"But what about all of those factories and jobs you guys promised? Remember, promises made promises kept? What's going on with these eggs? How's your 401k?",mymomknowsyourmom,2025-04-28T10:43:57,8
Wait... Didnt Trump say last week he was talking to them??   So which is it?  Watch the market tank again,coatofforearm,2025-04-28T11:05:38,2
"Why? Why would they call, they 100% have the upper hand. China doesn’t need anything from us. They are happy to talk with every other country while the U.S. burns to the ground.",Saber-Rattler-3448,2025-04-28T12:29:33,2

China may not call anytime soon. He should be not waiting next to the phone.  Recent survey shows most Americans are not checking their 401K.,PsychLegalMind,2025-04-28T10:48:59,1
"China probably doesn’t like the optics of appearing to cut deals to pacify the U.S. when the U.S. is creating the issue with respect to tariffs.  Almost certainly after all of the press coverage over the weekend about potential Chinese officials at the White House, possible deals being discussed, etc. and assuming the two sides weren’t really that close, China may just have backed off completely to leave the U.S. to implode and watch Trump flail.  It preserves China’s image that it wants to project.  First rule of tariff negotiating club is that you don’t talk about it.    And that’s all assuming talks were even actually happening, which we still don’t know for certain.",teamdiabetes11,2025-04-28T11:51:47,2
>Recent survey shows most Americans are not checking their 401K.  Trump thinks those are lies and maga swore on Christ that eggs and 401ks are the most important signs of the economy. They have zero convictions and it's disappointing.,mymomknowsyourmom,2025-04-28T10:52:06,3
"Oh, I checked. I got a message that says ""You may be invested too conservatively"". Yeah, I know. And it's going to stay like that for a bit.",StatusCount7032,2025-04-28T11:57:15,1
"39% of Americans are MAGA and that is his base who have never abandoned him. It is not enough to win elections, but it is more than enough to scare Republicans from opposing him.",PsychLegalMind,2025-04-28T10:57:54,1
"The more conservative the plan the better it is. It is the only safe place at the moment. However, I know some moderately conservative 401K plan holders and they are not checking for now. They are just tracking the stock and bond markets generally to estimate how much longer they may have to work.",PsychLegalMind,2025-04-28T12:14:10,1
">39% of Americans are MAGA and that is his base who have never abandoned him. It is not enough to win elections, but it is more than enough to scare Republicans from opposing him.  Ok?
