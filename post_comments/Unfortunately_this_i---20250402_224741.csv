Why is the vandalizer wearing a Tesla shirt?,hydromind1,2025-04-02T23:01:04,70

"We should be stipulating that we are against the vandalism of Tesla‚Äôs as well, or vandalism/arson of any kind. Intimidation/violence against Tesla owners should not become synonymous with the Democratic Party.   The real point to make is that Republicans are hypocrites and we aren‚Äôt. Pardoning actual domestic terrorists while making keying a car punishable with 20 years in jail is dictatorship-type stuff. Do NOT let this become a new normal - Dems need to be pushing back on this shit every fucking chance they get.   The ironic thing is they‚Äôre only pushing any of this at all because they feel bad for Elon, but once it sits in that he‚Äôs a liability to their electoral chances they will dump this so fast he won‚Äôt know what hit him.",cpatkyanks24,2025-04-02T22:55:18,14

The police department near me has all new teslas. When I say the ‚Äúlarge‚Äùofficer who was so far wedged into that little car I mean get the jaws of life. There is no way he could get out and arrest anyone. I can‚Äôt imagine he can even get a seatbelt on. I think they‚Äôre a model 3?,RubyWaves75,2025-04-03T12:20:43,1

Unfortunately. God I wish the Justice Department had done its job back in January 2021 and arrested Trump for treason and locked his ass away forever. America got complacent and the majority of Americans didn't even realize a coup was underway. It was literally a text book example of what the 14th amendment was protecting against. Every mechanism of government failed us and is continuing to do so. Day after day the crushing disappointment continues. üòñüòÆ‚Äçüí®,WoodenMarsupial4100,2025-04-03T14:54:02,1

"The divers are the victims though? Tesla owners, more than likely, bought their EVs back when Biden passed the EV law or bill that helped people get EVs with a tax rebate or whatever.

"You‚Äôre pushing back against a ‚Äúviolence and arson is bad‚Äù argument?

Also on a human level; it‚Äôs called being a fucking asshole.   The way to stop all the bad shit that‚Äôs happening is to actually win elections and that involves winning the battle of public opinion, which given the current 29% approval of the party, is not currently happening.
