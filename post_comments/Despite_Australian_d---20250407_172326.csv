2-3 trillion dollars in Australian retirement funds are invested in the U.S. market. They can hurt us...Badly.,Competitive-Bike-277,2025-04-07T17:55:19,1
"No really? It's like nobody ever said so before. No wait, it's like nobody ever listened before. Because a lot of people are very well aware that the Trumple is just burning down the US economy, and while the Rest of the World ^((TM)) will have to handle it, they will not suffer anywhere as much as the people of the US (super rich excluded).",bytemage,2025-04-07T17:31:46,1

I have recently converted my retirement funds to cash and I suspect that many other Australians are doing the same.  Exposure to the US market has now become too risky and its economic recession will drag the rest of the world down into a global recession.  I can handle no growth for as long as it takes and will be out of the market for a long time.,iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-04-07T18:58:06,1
