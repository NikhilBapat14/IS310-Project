There is nothing inherently wrong with a trade deficit. In fact most countries have them with someone else. The deficit wasn’t costing us money. We were buying more shit from then than they were from us. We weren’t getting ripped off.,ioncloud9,2025-05-04T20:31:28,99

"I am not sure if this is the answer, but I have a theory about how trump should be dealt with in interviews.  If he starts blatantly lying or dodging a question by going off topic, I think the interviewer should just say ""if you are going to spread misinformation (or dodge my questions), I cannot in good faith let this be broadcast"" and then just end it, walk out of the room and cut the cameras.",DarthLysergis,2025-05-04T19:28:02,57

"Our dealings with China need to be curtailed because they act in bad faith, not as an economic matter. We never should have gotten in bed with them to begin with.  I was hopeful that Trump may actually do something worthwhile and make meaningful headway in that regard. Instead, his artless bull in a China shop (heh) approach has further put us at a disadvantage.   These interviews are increasingly embarrassing and concerning. 30 dolls? 250 pencils? Who said that? Who has that? Is that what he really thinks the reality is? That people have far too much and can do with 10% of what they have?   Maybe that’s true. I’ve seen people get by with barely anything, but I’m not sure those should be national goals.   His utter refusal to even be honest about what he said 10 seconds prior means he knows he’s full of shit, but if he doesn’t say it, he allows people to make up their own favorable justifications for what he “really  meant.” (I’m not sure that actually admitting it would change that in reality, but I think that’s the game he’s playing.)  It’s such a shitshow I can’t even focus on one aspect to write a post about.   It sucks, because he’s actually right that we need to draw down and re-cast our dealings with China, but he’s making such a hash of it that we are probably, definitely, going to be worse in the end.",ElderContrarian,2025-05-05T07:25:48,0

"Exactly. If we have a deficit with another country we are probably getting cheap goods from them and the other country will have a growing economy, making them more likely to buy more US goods in the future.   Idiots like Trump can’t think that far out. His curiosity stops at a simple level, who is “winning” right now.",Quakes-JD,2025-05-04T22:46:08,30
"I have been nothing but extremely confused on why a trade deficit was a bad thing. I can’t even come up with a reasonable guess as to why a buying from a country that buys less from us is a bad thing.   Like, does he expect 1 Canadian to spend the same amount as 12 Americans?

"If you listen to him describe a trade deficit, it sounds like a person only paying a portion of an invoice.  This is something that he has done continually as a business owner.

It's a bit like how he believed asylum applicants were former inmates of mental institutions.

"For those of us who grew up in the NYC metro area, we’re 40 years into this and it’s frustrating.  > When I give the store $400, I come home with a nice tv that will give me hours of enjoyment. In Trump's mind, he's lost $400.  In your mind - and that of most normal people - there is a single transaction:  you give $400 and get a TV.  The store loses a TV and gets $400.  The two things are intrinsically tied together.   But in Trump’s mind, he sees these as two things that are disconnected from each other.  He sees “Get a TV.” as an event that exists wholly to itself.   If he wants a TV, he will get a TV.   Then he sees “give $400” as a totally separate event, also wholly to itself.   And he sees that event and goes, ‘Well, why would I want to just give $400?  That’s stupid.  What sort of idiot would do that?’  And so he’ll say whatever it takes for the store to deliver that TV without receiving payment and then just not pay for it.  And since doing anything about it - taking him to court to enforce payment for goods or services rendered - takes money in the form of attorneys and time in court, very few people actually see it through.  The net of that is that he lives in a world where he gets things and doesn’t pay for them and has done so for *decades.*  It shouldn’t be surprising that he thinks the way he does - his lifetime of experience supports his world view.   But as most of the country didn’t know someone who got stiffed by the man - it was 6 degrees to Kevin Bacon but usually only 3 to “Donald Trump fucked someone I know over” in the NYC metro - he is afforded the general presumption of playing by the rules of society and he takes advantage of it.",PapaDuckD,2025-05-05T07:54:43,3
