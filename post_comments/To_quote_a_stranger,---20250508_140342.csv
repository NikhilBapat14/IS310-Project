"The pope, and the catholic church as a whole, are a long way from being the best of humanity. And comparing anything to trump is a shit bar.",Qiller258,2025-05-08T15:32:17,49

"As a Catholic (who is registered Democrat), I hope Pope Leo XIV can remind the staunch Christian Republicans the true teachings of Christ and start to lead them away from the fake Christian views of Trump.",hbryan135,2025-05-08T17:13:33,5

Since when were we pro-Pope? This is a wild turn out as an ex-Catholic.,BlackMagicWorman,2025-05-08T17:11:16,2

lol at the catholic not being as or more evil than Trump.,Kodyfromsisterwives,2025-05-08T19:11:10,0
I see a lot of comments against the Catholic Church. I wonder how this is different from any other form of hate directed at religions? I don’t see that it is. You are following in the footsteps of nativism.,PuzzleheadedAsk6448,2025-05-09T00:40:47,-2

You're clearly not. Pope Francis fought against everything you're implying and Pope Leo XIV was handpicked as a Cardinal by Francis himself. Modern Catholicism is seeking to break away from the misdeeds of its past.,TerribleTerabytes,2025-05-08T14:31:05,0

By misdeeds of the past you mean things that happened very recently that the church apologized maybe once for? To be catholic means you turn a blind eye to pedophiles and encourage the church to sweep any sex scandals under the rug.  Imagine the response if Jewish rabbi’s spent decades raping young boys and Jewish leadership and organizations actively did everything they could to cover it up. Honestly the blowback to the church hasn’t been extreme or severe enough.,Ok_Sky7827,2025-05-08T14:47:21,21

"Yes, that's exactly what I was referring to. It doesn't matter how recent it is, my point is that Pope Francis made strides to put an end to it and his successor handpicked by him will follow suit. Your viewpoint of the Catholic church is not based on recent events and I would suggest actually looking into what Pope Francis tried to do to make amends.",TerribleTerabytes,2025-05-08T14:53:38,-12
The pope doesn’t,PrincessofAldia,2025-05-08T16:15:58,-7
"I know who Pope Francis is, I know what he’s about. One good pope doesn’t make up for decades of raping and abusing children and doing everything within your power to cover it up. Maybe in the next 20-30 years thing will change, but for the next 20-30 years the Catholic Church should be known for one and only 1 thing: Raping kids and using all the power and connections of the church to cover it up.",Ok_Sky7827,2025-05-08T14:58:33,15
The last pope said gender ideology was the greatest threat to modern society.    My existence is not a threat but he said that anyway. He can kick rocks in hell. ,Scum-Bucket704,2025-05-08T22:00:18,2
"No, but its certainly a start. Is the Church not allowed to try to right their wrongs? I think given that the Pope's prior to Francis were more Conservative, Leo XVI should be given the chance to take it even further. The good news is that he's only 69 which is really young for a Pope. Given that his health remains well, we may very well be with this Pope for 20-25 years. That's a real, genuine chance to put the Catholic Church on the correct path.",TerribleTerabytes,2025-05-08T15:11:49,-9
"I really do wonder how peaceful the world would be if everyone didn't take everything so damn personally. Pope Francis made the biggest strides in LGBT acceptance but sure, take one minorly negative comment that doesn't even target trans people in particular and run with it I guess.",TerribleTerabytes,2025-05-08T23:49:12,0
"Pope Francis is in heaven, god bless his soul. He was amongst the most outstandingly moral and humble men to walk this earth.",PuzzleheadedAsk6448,2025-05-09T00:38:52,0
"You’re completely ignoring everything I’m saying and you’re letting the church get away with everything they did. One of my biggest issues in all of this is how regular Catholics act like what the church did is bad but not really that bad, and we all should all forgive them because they might be actually trying to not rape little boys now. Meanwhile these same ppl have no issue condemning you to hell for eternity because you don’t believe in the exact same god they do. It’s pretty psychotic behavior when you think about it.",Ok_Sky7827,2025-05-08T16:00:12,9
It says a lot that your standards for a pope are so low. Imagine how much better the country would be if Catholics have better standards for how they treat others,Ok_Sky7827,2025-05-09T14:35:54,0
"What when did I do either of those things? I both acknowledged your point and agreed there were wrongdoings. I'm also not trying to downplay it, I agree that it's horrible and is part of the reason I'm not a Catholic anymore. I'm just saying that the Church trended positively thanks to the efforts of Pope Francis and with this new younger Pope, I'm hoping it will continue for decades to come. That's it. Also it's funny you mention condemning non-believers. That's the other reason why I don't really consider myself a Catholic anymore. I dont agree with that belief.   And don't get me wrong, I'm also not saying that these two Popes make up for centuries of wrongdoings within the Church, far from it. I'm just optimistic that it might finally turn around and start fixing itself. It's gotta start somewhere.",TerribleTerabytes,2025-05-08T16:53:50,1
"Hey, at least it's going somewhere. I don't disagree that Conservative Catholics and religious people as a whole should treat people better and I'm hoping Pope Leo will push for that harder than Francis did.",TerribleTerabytes,2025-05-09T15:21:18,1
That’s just lovely kid. Good to know that Catholics have raised there standards from letting priests rape kids to maybe being against priests raping kids. Such high standards for Catholics.,Ok_Sky7827,2025-05-09T15:31:13,0
"Damn, I genuinely pity you. Progress is progress regardless. You just sound like a miserable person.",TerribleTerabytes,2025-05-09T16:11:08,1
"What’s sad is that you’re personally attacking me. All I’ve done is attack Catholics and priests who tried to ignore all the harm done. Never said anything about you personally, not sure why you’re attacking me instead of the issue.",Ok_Sky7827,2025-05-09T16:20:37,1
"I already attacked the issue. You decided to be condescending and miserable because I tried to show some optimism. I'm not saying that these two Popes are going to cleanse the Catholic Church or its members overnight or in anyway make up for the centuries of corruption, sexual abuse and other wrongdoings. It'll be centuries more before it even comes close to any of that. I'm just voicing the hope that this is the start of genuine change and growth.   I'm a former Catholic btw. I left the Church for a myriad of reasons which includes this.",TerribleTerabytes,2025-05-09T16:26:00,1
"That’s twice you’ve attacked me now. It sounds like you’re mad at for not having the exact same point of view as you. All I’m saying is the response from Catholics a few years ago from when all of this became public news was flaccid and weak. No need to personally attack me again, and you’re not going to change my mind. I just think it’s kind of pathetic to elect a new pope and then try to act like things are much better now. You don’t have to agree with me, it’s just my opinion. It’s also weird that you keep saying you’re not with the Catholic Church but then keep defending them.",Ok_Sky7827,2025-05-09T17:02:38,0
