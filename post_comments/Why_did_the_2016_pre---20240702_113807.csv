"I just want to quibble with the accuracy of those numbers. Per Wikipedia 2016 had 10 faithless electors, but more importantly a faithless elector from Minnesota in 2004 cast the notorious ""John Ewards"" ballot, and in 2000 D.C. elector Barbara Lett-Stimmons cast a blank ballot to protest a lack of congressional representation for the District. Although she said she personally considered it an act of civil disobedience rather than as a faithless elector.  Then if you consider the 1980s modern, you also have the 1988 case of Margarette Leach of West Virginia who cast her ballot with the ticket in reverse order, Bentsen for pres and Dukakis for vice-pres, as protest against the electoral college.",WhatIsPants,2024-07-02T12:46:12,6
"Idk if you remember it, but it was a really weird election. Trump winning caught everyone off guard, not the least the Trump Campaign... But both candidates were incredibly unpopular. There was a movement to try to force a compromise contingent election.   A contingent election occurs when no candidate reaches 270 in the Electoral College. If that happens, the election goes to the House, where each state gets one vote, and the House picks a president from the top three winners in the EC. So the idea was for the Faithless Electors to vote for someone other than Trump or Clinton who could win in the House (that's why you saw votes for Colin Powell from Democratic Electors, as they saw him generally as a ""rule following conservative"" who might be able to win in the House, but wouldn't be as big of a risk to the Republic as Trump).   The scheme was unsuccessful, as they were only able to peel away two Trump electors, and they needed 37.",Arthur_Edens,2024-07-02T16:13:02,5

"I don't know if a lot of people realize, but '16 had much more actual election malfeasance than '20. The Russian interference & hacking (& the eventual collusion discovered) had tons of hard evidence, whereas the stolen election claims had none.",notpynchon,2024-07-03T12:40:21,3
