I like vet day more. It's about all engagements and sacrifices..,spezeditedcomments,2025-05-02T13:42:40,1444
"This is disrespectful to all veterans who‚Äôve served in the litany of wars/engagements ever since WW2.   Vietnam, Grenada, Iraq, Afghanistan, Balkan conflicts, Gulf War‚Ä¶the air campaigns in Syria, the men who operate nuclear submarines throughout the world.   They all deserve respect",Unlucky_Buyer_2707,2025-05-02T14:44:53,1542
Totally unnecessary.  So frustrating he's worried about stuff like this when there is so much else to do.,SonnyC_50,2025-05-02T16:57:16,378

"OR‚Ä¶ or‚Ä¶ hear me out: we don‚Äôt take YET ANOTHER thing AWAY from U.S. veterans?¬†  It‚Äôs fine to recognize history. Context is good!

This seems both unnecessary and not that great an idea.,deadzip10,2025-05-02T14:14:06,264
But why? I‚Äôm for recognition of specifically the two world wars but this just eliminates a day that‚Äôs broadly meant to recognize all our vets regardless of what war they‚Äôve served,just_one_random_guy,2025-05-02T13:56:21,234

"Ehhh idk about this one. If you want to create holidays and celebrations for WW1 and WW2 then go for it. But if the idea is to get rid of Veterans Day altogether in favor of those two specific dates then that's a hard pass from me. I certainly could get behind Veterans Day staying where it is and these two as new and separate holidays.  Once again, just communicate clearly and don't make things harder for yourself Don.",Spartanlegion117,2025-05-02T13:42:42,283

"What the heck?  I get that it is Armistice Day, which nobody ever calls it that here.  What's wrong with keeping it as-is?  Even reverting to Armistice Day rolls off the tongue better than that mouthful.  And... that's my birthday and my birthday will always be on Veteran's Day.",miscstarsong,2025-05-02T13:55:10,112

"Whoever wrote this needs to be fired.  You would think someone writing for Military Times would understand military history.   November 11th has nothing to do with WWII.   V-E day is May 8th (May 9th in Russia, due to time zones) and V-J day is August 15th, both in 1945.   November 11th is the day of the armistice of WWI and is celebrated as Armistice Day in many other nations.   We called it Armistice Day until 1954, when it was rededicated to all veterans as Veterans Day.",Lord_Elsydeon,2025-05-02T14:26:12,78
"This is only a good idea if he is going to make another day Veteran's Day and make that a national holiday as well. If not, this is stupid. I'd much rather spend a day celebrating all veterans than celebrating the end of a war that literally no one still alive today remembers and most of the country probably doesn't even know took place in the 20th century.",Zaphenzo,2025-05-02T21:11:56,17

Would suck if you're in during an unpopular war that will never get a holiday.  Just keep Veteran's Day and replace one of those garbage identity months with Veteran's Month.,ChristopherRoberto,2025-05-02T18:18:30,14

"Fake News. He's not removing the name of Veteran's Day, he's adding a celebration of victory in WWI to November 11th, because that's when the war ended.  This bullshit article even admits halfway through that Trump did not actually say he's renaming the name Veteran's Day. There's no reason why it can't be both.",Fact_Stater,2025-05-02T22:34:00,-19
Exactly. Victory Day for World War I sounds like a leftist idea to take the day away from veterans.,thewholetruthis,2025-05-03T01:30:53,-24

"Third Saturday in May is Armed Forces Day, but yes Veterans Day is much more well known.  Armed Forces Day is a US national holiday celebrated annually on the third Saturday of May to recognize and honor the country's military services. It was established in 1949 by Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson to replace individual days of celebration for each military branch and reinforce their unification under the Department of Defense. President Harry S. Truman officially made it a holiday in 1950, and President John F. Kennedy formalized it in 1961.",Jscott1986,2025-05-02T22:43:01,21

"I expect it was a typo in the article as just prior to that they write...  > President Donald Trump in a social media post Thursday announced plans to rename Veterans Day as ‚ÄúVictory Day for World War I‚Äù and establish May 8 as ‚ÄúVictory Day for World War II.‚Äù  It's fairly easy to add that extra ""I"" when referencing WWI especially when you're in an article that also mentions WWII.

"Yup. Short of another World War we're past the point of no return on fixing it.  Plan well, set contingencies even outside the country. Take advantage of dollar arbitrage as long as you can.  I honestly think social media hastened the division in this country, mostly from external forces (bots, paid trolls, disinformation campaig on both sides). That said its a global phenomenon. However the culture here has become so zero-sum and black and white, and ultimately is killing the social fabric and cohesiveness of our nation.  Rural areas around the world is my hedge. Where there is less technology and social bonds are still valued is where the impacts of this unraveling will be less felt.  There will be another side and everything will moderate once again, but for for now, crazy times.",supernormalnorm,2025-05-02T23:27:16,19
"Because for them, rightly, it‚Äôs about a single victory that was existential and deserves to be celebrated.
