"[18 USC § 116](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/116) specifically outlaws female genital mutilation. There is no corresponding section of federal law banning male genital mutilation. The context of the passage of this law is that it was targeted at practices involving people who are assigned female at birth, and especially considering that it was passed in the 90s, I doubt there was any consideration at all for trans people per se.  If you're referring to circumcision, it simply isn't illegal, and our lawmakers don't seem to think that it ought to be illegal. If you somehow weren't thinking of circumcision -- neither our lawmakers nor the administration want to be perceived as attacking this widespread and accepted social practice.  Female genital mutilation was banned to do certain social practices that do [considerably more damage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/fact-sheet-on-female-genital-mutilation-or-cutting.html) than circumcision, whereas male genital mutilation with similar severity (i.e., more severe than circumcision) is not a widespread practice or in need of specific law/policy.",curien,2025-01-29T11:26:19,3
"I wonder, if this all actually goes into play, will female genital mutilation be legally inextricably connected to sex change operations?   Also -- can an executive order like this move forward if it contains factual inaccuracies? Or is that covered here:    ""Sec. 10.  Severability.  If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstances, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of any of its other provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.""",ca77,2025-01-29T11:41:15,2
"Also thank you for your help, you've been perfectly helpful on this in a way that gives me hope for the future of the internets.",ca77,2025-01-29T11:41:53,1
">I wonder, if this all actually goes into play, will female genital mutilation be legally inextricably connected to sex change operations?  I think that ship sailed decades ago. Anti-trans rhetoric has long associated bottom surgery with mutilation.  >Also -- can an executive order like this move forward if it contains factual inaccuracies?  If you mean like the stuff in Sec 1, it's very common for laws (including EOs) to have an introductory section that is just a soapbox for the author without legal effect.",curien,2025-01-29T11:54:49,5
