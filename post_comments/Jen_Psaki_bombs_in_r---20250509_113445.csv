"Nobody wants pointless ex-mooks on TV, they're just all offered TV gigs as part of their payment package for putting their work in.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-05-09T12:14:01,90
"Good. I'm gonna enjoy the schadenfreude on this one. I found her wildly condesending as press sec, not to mention incredibly dishonest. Not a fan.",onemanmelee,2025-05-09T12:55:52,53
"MSNBC needs to stop with the hyper partisan hackery, or go off the air permanently. Their ratings have been through the floor of the 9th circle of hell itself, and itâ€™s gonna stay that way until they cut this garbage out of their airwaves. Nobody with a single functioning braincell gives a shit anymore. America has been (mostly) disillusioned, and thereâ€™s no pulling the wool over our eyes again.   Reverse course, or shut down. Those are the only two options.",Ok-Willow-4232,2025-05-09T12:18:18,30

"MSNBC has become the politics version of only fans, but itâ€™s free and the talking heads spend the time fellating the Democrat party, its politicians, and its supporters.",cliffotn,2025-05-09T19:23:34,16
"Liberal women tend to be condescending (and unlikable)- AOC, Kamala Harris, Hillary Clinton, Elizabeth Warren, Michelle Obama, Gwen Walz, Ilhan Omar, just to name a few.",Trondkjo,2025-05-09T16:25:22,20
I wasnâ€™t following politics as much when she was the press secretary. Was she better or worse than Karine? Because Karine seemed pretty damn condescending.,Icant_concentrate,2025-05-09T15:31:30,6
The same people that say Fox isn't real news are the ones that watch MSNBC.,Trondkjo,2025-05-09T16:25:55,9
"ðŸ’¯Â   You are absolutely right, they have crossed the Rubicon Of Lies and now they want to go back to the way it was before everyone caught them lying.  That public trust took a lot of hard work and decades to build, they used to still lie but they kept the lies small interspersed into the truth and people believed them.  Then they got cocky and thought that they could start telling people all these big hard to believe lies and barely any truth, and they abused us and did it in the most smug manner imaginable.  Now they think that they can go back to having that trust that was broken and start leading us with their medium size lies again.  Bro the public trust is GONE, now you are at the point where you have to start telling the truth and NOTHING but the truth for DECADES in order to get back to a place where you have built enough public confidence that what you are saying is true before you can start lying again.  But no they are back to their old games of like 2016-17 or so as if 2020-2025 never happened.  Get real.",OzoneLaters,2025-05-09T13:35:16,10

"Personally, I found Psaki more condescending, but Karine more of a brazen idiot.   Though, admittedly, I'd mostly tuned out by Karine's tenure, so I might be wrong.  Disliked both of them quite thoroughly though.",onemanmelee,2025-05-09T16:06:08,17
IMO if I had to rate them I would say Psaki> Kjp.,DogeBane,2025-05-10T18:52:11,1
