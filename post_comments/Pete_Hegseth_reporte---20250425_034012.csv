"dude! This administration is saving foreign intelligence agencies billions in total... can you imagine how much the Israeli, Chinese, Korean, Russian, etc. agencies would have had to pay for the info this moron is just giving away for free?",Shot_Independence274,2025-04-25T03:43:53,12

Only the best. Top people. You could literally drag any rando off the street who could smash this role in/by comparison.,bickering_fool,2025-04-25T03:44:50,3
The sheer hubris of these people bypassing security measures and thinking it's perfectly okay. Some enterprising hackers should leak his internet history.,UnexpectedAnomaly,2025-04-25T04:07:10,3

"Don't pay attention to conservatives' words - they lie constantly.   They dive care what she did - the bush team was easy way worse - they didn't like her.    They care who you are, ~~but~~ ***not*** what you do. ",NickelBackwash,2025-04-25T04:50:27,3
"NIPR still blocks and traces things. He wanted full dirty dirty for his own personal convenience and untraceability. Everyone hates working in the pentagon and all of the restrictions within, but we are professionals and do the job the way it’s supposed to be done - with concern and care in order to support our warfighters.  We don’t use our positions for personal gain, convenience, or safety. Luckily he won’t have to deal with it for too much longer. Anyone that thinks that a dirtbag retired national guard major can run the DoD is a full blown idiot.",DarthPlayer8282,2025-04-25T06:03:33,2
