Nice to see a Democrat with a backbone,ColeBeasleyMD,2025-04-23T13:50:44,21

I don't think I'd call any Senator low-profile but I'm very glad he's been so active.,Searchlights,2025-04-23T13:51:46,9
"May God continue to bless Senator Van Hollen. In the face of apathy on the part of other Democratic ""leaders"", he put himself in potential danger and his credibility on the line standing up for righteousness, Constitutional guarantees of due process, freedom and dignity.  Equally important, El Salvador's government knows that a US Senator cares about the incarceration of Abrego Garcia and others in their notorious CECOT prison, which reduces the chances of their executing him in the dark.   No doubt Trump and his Reichsregierung lied to El Salvador ""President"" Bukele to the effect that Trump had a mandate to turn the USA into a police state and El Salvador would benefit as the concentration camp host.",Nerd-19958,2025-04-23T14:07:24,8
"I had never heard of him before now, but I'm so impressed by what he did. Talk about going the extra mile for your constituents... he traveled a lot of miles!  What impressed me the most is that he took that trip without a guarantee of a result. So there was a risk that he'd take the trip and nothing would result from it, which would open him up to criticism of ""That whole trip was pointless!"" That's what almost happened, actually. He tried to get a meeting with Abrego Garcia and was rejected, even for a phone call! Then he tried again for a second day and was rejected again, and was about to go home. Then things changed at the last minute.  Van Hollen was Abrego Garcia's only point of contact with the outside world in over a month. That is absolutely awful, but still, at least he had one point of contact instead of zero!! And it was amazing to see that he was alive, since there was no proof of life before then.  Other members of Congress should follow Van Hollen's example and keep fighting for Abrego Garcia and all the other people who were sent to El Salvador without due process.",sachiprecious,2025-04-23T14:12:31,6

"But Tim Pool said at the White House press conference that Garcia is indeed a gang member who deserved to be deported. Also Karoline Leavitt thanked Tim Pool for bringing this diversity of ideas to the White House and concluded that this is the position the Trump administration also holds. So, there.",Space_Sweetness,2025-04-23T16:40:58,2
There will never be a better time for this in any of their careers. Ever.,Traditional_Fox7696,2025-04-24T03:46:45,2
Trump has been ordered by the Supreme Court to return Mr Garc√≠a and has Flatley refused we are in a Constitutional crisis  Trump has placed himself King and the law,Ok_Sound9973,2025-04-23T15:21:56,1
That's a very important question. Part of the answer is that other members of Congress need to follow Van Hollen's example and do what they can to fight for these people's due process rights. They need to keep the pressure on.  The other part of this answer is... the courts. The judicial system needs to do what it can to hold people accountable who are defying court orders. Judge Boasberg and Judge Xinis are working on it now. Thankfully these two judges genuinely care about the situation and are laying the groundwork for contempt!,sachiprecious,2025-04-23T14:20:28,3
