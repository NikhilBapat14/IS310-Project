"> “All the religious school is saying is ‘Don’t exclude us on account of our religion,’” Justice Brett Kavanaugh said. “If you go and apply to be a charter school and you’re an environmental studies school, or you’re a science-based school, or you’re a Chinese immersion school, or you’re a English grammar-focused school, you can get in. And then you come in and you say, ‘Oh, we’re a religious school.’ It’s like, ‘Oh, no, can’t do that, that’s too much.’ That’s scary.” He continued: “You can’t treat religious people and religious institutions and religious speech as second-class in the United States… And when you have a program that’s open to all comers except religion… that seems like rank discrimination against religion.”  I just don’t even know what to say. The argument is simply nonsense. Lucky for me, the Republican OK AG found the words for me:  > The Oklahoma Statewide Virtual School Board granted the charter, but Oklahoma’s Republican attorney general, Gentner Drummond, asked the Oklahoma Supreme Court to order the board to reverse course. “This is not [about] free exercise of religion,” Drummond has said. “This is taxpayer-funded, state-sponsored religious indoctrination. That’s what this is. You’ve just got to call it what it is.”",CanEnvironmental4252,2025-05-01T21:34:17,330
"Was waiting for the shoe to drop on this one.   A full third of my property taxes go to schools, which is great even not having children because literate citizens are a good thing for everyone.  Spending thousands a year so a bunch of weirdos can teach kids that a magic man in the sky is watching everything they do and hates them if they’re not “normal” changes that.  I knew this SC would be bad but things are quickly turning into full-blown Christian nationalist nightmare.   I’m not religious, but typically tolerant. People can believe whatever they want. I don’t give a shit.  That said, pay for your own religious education if you want to indoctrinate the children who won’t be speaking to you after they leave the house. It’s not anyone else’s place to be required to cater to your delusions.  I grew up in an area with a LOT of homeschooling. Kids would go from home school environments and finish in public high school.   A huge percentage were completely taken aback at actual classes about actual things. I think a lot of them were just given bible studies and enough basics to pass competency exams.   I’m sure some of the schools will be fine, but that’s not the point. Unreal that we want to use tax money to further this garbage.  Edit: can’t words good",eatpackets,2025-05-01T20:56:04,277

By virtue of a poor decision to originally allow private schools public funds to focus education for the few opens the door to religious indoctrination then the only real choice is to disallow any public funds to any non public entities to quash the possibility of sliding into the aforementioned constitutional paradox”  Let the court then rule that on a matter of principle, no private schools can receive public funds and be done with it.",EyeFicksIt,2025-05-02T03:50:16,8

This argument is plain nonsense and completely misses the understanding of separation of church and state, something someone who studies law for living should know about. The constitution, specifically the 1st amendment, in plain text says that governments cannot establish a religion; and allocating taxpayer dollars to a religious institution does exactly that. How someone who studies constitutional law does not realize this is beyond me.  The whole point IS to exclude the school because they’re a religious school.

"I can't believe I'm watching the US actively destroy its own public education system. Not just this case, but the increasing prevalence of private school vouchers.  Most vouchers end up going to parents whose children are already in private schools, meaning they can already afford the cost. These are just checks to people of means.   Then the private schools can notch up their tuition. Vouchers become a direct money flow from the government to these businesses. If the Arizona example is anything to go by, public coffers get drained, and the public school system is starved.  You end up with two government funded school systems.

"Separation of Church and State per The Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Wherein public education is a public service provided by the State, it therefore falls underneath The Establishment Clause. The proponents of this measure and push for religious indoctrination in public school settings using taxpayer funds as well as services provided by the State which, again, fall under the scope of said clause are the same people who have pushed for ""school choice"" and ""vouchers"" wherein parents can ""choose"" which schools to send their children to.   So, GOP and Republican voters, which is it? Do you want school choice or to force Christian doctrine into the public school curriculum? As it sits today, parents are fully capable of homeschooling their children and many churches offer primary education through their facilities in lieu of homeschooling. The freedoms and choice are there already. As the OK AG stated, this is religious indoctrination that is being put forth to be funded by the State using taxpayer funds. Kavanaugh's argument is nonsensical and polemical at best. Kavanaugh is warping the narrative to say that it is discrimination, where no such discrimination exists nor could it, again, because of The Establishment Clause. Once again, ""constitutional scholars"" and ""Originalists"" is a bullshit term levied by the Federalist Society judges and staff to just mean ""the Constitution means whatever I feel like it means"".   Furthermore, I cannot wait for the Church of Satan to also get in on this action if the SCOTUS does rule on this in favor of the Christian Nationalists, as you can't prefer one faith over another. There will be a lawsuit, it will make it to SCOTUS and they will either have to nakedly say ""ONLY Christianity"" or reverse course. What about Islam? What about Judaism? What about other world faiths? This is the problem with ""religious liberty"" laws and legal pursuits is the Christian Nationalists don't fundamentally understand and/or don't care but are unable to consider that means ALL religions have to be included if they want themselves inserted into public education curricula. If my child is going to be exposed to and forced to learn Christian religion, they should also be exposed to and taught about other faiths, including Satanism, with equal time and focus for each. Of course, mandating the learning of faiths to any students is just absurd and not valuable to practical education. Explain to me how Christianity is going to provide any material benefit economically or academically to students. Christianity won't provide any additional context or value when it comes to algebra, trigonometry, or biology. Christianity won't teach anything or compliment knowledge on economics.  You can achieve the same ethical and moral social conditioning through philosophy alone without the involvement of fantastical deities.   Let's follow the money here because I'm almost certain Justices are being paid to vote in favor of these zealots as there is no reasonable explanation given how flagrantly antithetical it is the the law and our Constitution on its face.",Cuntmasterflex9000,2025-05-02T10:41:49,3

"My parents sent me to Christian private schools, but other than calling themselves Christian, they were secular.  We went to church for weddings and funerals, and that was it.  Unfortuately for me, they decided public schools were not educating me well enough, so they sent me to Christian private schools.  Multiple ones.  The last one I did my very best to follow the rules, and I was still kicked out, for breaking a religious rule nobody told me about in advance.  From these serial expulsions, I learned that following rules well gets one the worst possible punishments.  I was 16 with the last school.    It had been my elementary school dream to grow up and have a family like my parents had.  At 16 years of age, I decided I would never procreate:  Protecting my future children from the cruelty of American Christians was that important to me.  I knew of no other way to protect them in a predominately Christian culture.",teary_ayed,2025-05-02T14:07:57,0

It shouldn’t be a shock that some people want the option to use their money for other venues, including religious schools.   It’s an option to take a hard line, no public money in religious schools. And to continue to deliver a product of continually diminished value to parents and students alike.   It’s also an option to seed the courts, including the Supreme Court, with justices who see things differently. I see the anger from opponents and understand it as well.

"The solution Christian Nationalists have for that problem is to turn public schools over to churches and homeschoolers.  To quote what that want done to public schools:  ""WE DENY that civil authorities are tasked with being the caretakers of citizens or educators of children, as these duties belong primarily to the Church and to families, respectively. We deny that the civil government should endeavor to take on these responsibilities, and we deny that they do so to the benefit of society. Rather, such “charity” displaces families by creating a culture of dependence upon the state whose education often tends to debauch children with godless philosophies and perverse instruction. We deny that, in Scripture, God ever approves of tolerance toward depravity like child sacrifice and mutilation and promotion of open, sexual perversion. We would follow our King, and He does no such thing.""      So, they want to end public education by segregating it into churches along with homeschooling.

"I'm not sure the ""establish"" is the key argument here. If *any* religion can get their charter school funded, then the government isn't establishing a religion.  I think the angle here is that religious education is generally discriminatory in nature. They infuse superiority of their group into their teachings. While they may not bar a Jew from attending, they will teach that Jew that Jews are inferior to Catholics because Jesus is the progression of Judaism.   We have been more or less tolerant of religion specifically because it is religion, and it was generally out of the public eye. Hey, the church can tell its congregants that people who eat meat on Fridays during Lent are going to hell, and that's all fine and good because it's the church doing it, and no one is funding it.   However once the government is intertwined with religion in this way, it is perhaps time for the government to inspect the religious messages that it is funding, to make sure that nothing illegal is being taught, that there is no discrimination, and that the rules do not penalize people arbitrarily. So where are those female priests? Why is gender-based discrimination permitted?   In other words, Brett, the government would not be endorsing a religion, it would just be making sure that every last thing that religion did was subject to the same rules and laws as everyone else.

Slavery was ended because of Christians deciding that it did not jive well with the idea of all humans being made in the image and likeness of God. Slavery was the norm worldwide in all societies for all of times until that point. The same is true for most “rights” we enjoy. Christianity is the literal backbone of western society.

But, Christians can't seem to leave well enough alone, and are hell bent on reversing all the progress that we've made, in the guise of ""religious freedom"" and a persecution complex.  Christianity, like Islam, are literally cancers on the planet, because of their missionary aspect.  > the Catholic Church alone is the largest charitable organisation on the planet  The argument isn't that Christians do good.

"Ah. The nuance that you might not see is that education is intertwined with racism and housing policy. The reason conservatives oppose public education is because in the 1960s it was ordered to be desegregated. Before that there were ""white"" schools and ""black"" schools.  When that was no longer possible, many people in the South pulled their kids from the public schools and put them in private schools, sometimes referred to as ""segregation academies"", but also religious schools - and now they want to have the government fund those private schools with public money vouchers.  They did it differently in the North - people moved from the racially-mixed (but segregated) cities into the almost 100% white towns. Then they prevented denser housing from being built in those towns, effectively keeping them mostly white. This flight effectively resulted in the urban areas having concentrated poverty and lower property values - schools are funded via property taxes. So basically, people in the North created public ""white"" schools, which is why no one wants to build more housing.",MoonBatsRule,2025-05-03T18:25:02,1

You wanna have one and not need one, and not need one and not have it.” It’s scary to even have the thoughts of worrying you’ll have to defend yourself from illegal government actions. And to be clear, I still think at this point most citizens are not in imminent danger from the government, but again…we’re nearing tipping points.",P1xelHunter78,2025-05-02T05:23:34,2

"You are missing the point. Yes absolutely some Christians were in favor of slavery, much in keeping with everyone else in history. This is not interesting, this is the normal game people play of using their beliefs to keep the status quo going. What is interesting is that the people who broke history, who argued successfully for the abolition of slavery, did so from an explicitly Christian lens. There is no way to read this other than; Christianity was the first system of thought in human history to give dignity and rights to all human beings.   Yes the Bible has those passages, the Bible says many things (also every passage you mention is Old Testament). That doesn’t mean that the system of thought that arises from the Bible, especially New Testament, is not the single most important line of thought in human history regarding human rights.   To be perfectly clear: without the Bible, slavery would still exist, you would not be seen as innocent until proven guilty, disabled people would not be seen as full human beings, etc etc. ",the_windless_sea,2025-05-02T08:32:24,2

"> Singling Christianity out is being ridiculous  I'm not singling out Christianity, you did. I am responding to you.  > Literally every political ideology that has ever been tried in practice has death attributed to it, whats your point?   Politics + religion is deadly. And religious people often want to control politics to enforce their ideals, because they believe their Book gives them the Truth. Gay marriage must be abolished, because the Book says that homosexuality is an abomination.  > Enlightenment did limit religious influence but practically all of the concepts advocated for were from a Christian cultural backdrop.  Not precisely. First, much of the ideals of the Enlightenment came from Greek philosophy, recently rediscovered after the Renaissance, which predates Christianity. Second, the main driving force for the Enlightenment was prosperity and stability. There were plenty of other places in Europe that were also Christian, but which remained backwards and violent.  > We were all made in the image of God, we all should have equal rights here on earth seems like a logical line of reasoning doesnt it?   The entire point of the Enlightenment was remove God from the equation, to find a secular basis for morality.  The problem with the ""image of God"" is that is very unevenly applied. For a very long time, black people weren't considered ""in the image of God"", and thus were given less rights. Men and women are also ""in the image of God"", but somehow women are treated differently than men.  > Mentioning missionary work as a cancer is incredibly dehumanizing.  It's a metaphor. The problem with missionary activity is the ideology that comes with it, spreading their ideology among impoverished people. For example, in Africa, missionaries are spreading Evangelical ideas of homophobia and purity culture. Gay people in Africa are suffering significant persecution and even death, egged on by missionary Christians.  > you see how judging ENTIRE movements by only the bad isnt at all fair?  Except the bad is part of the ideology of the movement. Speaking of which, you know what's worse than an atheist? A progressive Christian. I have seen a ridiculous amount of hate directed at Episcopal Churches who fly the rainbow flag and ordain women. Where is this hate coming from?",TippySkippy12,2025-05-02T10:23:24,1

"Definitely not women. There is so much misogyny in the Bible. https://thinkandverify.wordpress.com/2013/09/06/misogyny-and-insults-to-women-in-the-bible-new-testament/  Plus the passages I already mentioned are pretty horrible towards women.  Female slaves are stuck forever. Young Virgin girls are kept as sex slaves in war/genocide. A rapist can rape a virgin girl and pay her father 30 shekels of silver and they must get married. Numerous tests and the importance of purity for girls. Women are treated as property to men throughout the Bible. All Women are punished with painful child birth because of Eve’s transgressions.   Edit: I’m happy there are pro lgbtq+ friendly churches and appreciate the Christians that do treat all people kindly and fairly.  That’s what this world is sorely missing right now.

"Politics plus anything can be deadly. The last century has seen more dead as a result of aggressively anti-religious/secular regimes than any war of religion in history.   Many figures in the enlightenment were at the very least theistic in their worldview and a large sum of those were more pretty plainly Christian. Locke, Newton, and Kant being some of them. This doesnt make the enlightenment a purely Christian movement, but it absolutely doesnt make it an anti-Christian movement either.  The image of God was absolutely unevenly applied and thats less of a fault of religion/Christianity in particular and moreso of human hypocrisy. Christianity arrived in Africa right around when it did in Europe, it is not a white mans religion by any means.  If you oppose certain messages of missionaries, fair enough critique it, but these people have fed and tended to the poor across the world. Its pretty dehumanizing to call their work cancerous who just want to help and have sincere compassion in their hearts.  Progressive Christians a lot of the time fall into heresy without really knowing it. Women cant be priests as men and women have different vocations, not unequal- just distinct. As for LGBT issues, we’re all sinners and all sin separates us from God in one way or another. No one would ever deny a sinner entry into a church, so long as they repent and do their best to improve. Where issues arise is when people attempt to compromise with sin and treat it like it isnt a sin",KnezNikola,2025-05-02T11:44:19,1

"You’re missing such a crucial point. Christianity when actually adhered to is the *way out* of tribalism, hatred, and lies.  It’s right there in the words of Jesus. You can cherry pick passages all you want but you miss that Jesus was a revolution that is meant to supersede the rules that came before.   Regarding women, there are again multiple passages in the New Testament that were revolutionary in their respect and treatment of women. Jesus healing the bleeding woman, for example.   You keep cherry picking passages from the Old Testament means you are no better than the evangelicals who do the same.

"Oh no no I didnt mean or attempt to claim the Church rooted it out, it will happen even after these systems were put in place but hopefully less and I probably should’ve specified that.  It use to be the offending priest would go to confession and promptly get swapped to another parish. Confessions cleans the sinners soul but does nothing to help the victim. The system now is way more rigid, zero tolerance for any priest found guilty and further reports to non-church legal authorities.
