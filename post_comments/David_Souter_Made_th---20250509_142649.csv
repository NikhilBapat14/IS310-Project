"The reaction to Souter from the right, when they expected him to be a reliable right wing voter, and not the fifth vote to save Roe back in 92, is why the court got more ideological.  After him, the right has been laser focused on getting the jurist furthest to the right they could get past the senate onto the court. Those bomb throwers have helped take us to where we are today.   Can't blame Souter for that.",travio,2025-05-09T14:45:24,4
