"The right wingers support their counterparts in Germany. It is just not Rubio; the group includes Musk and Vance who have said similar things about lack of Democracy and political freedom in Germany. The German government considers AfD an extremist group, and its group includes leaders with Neo Nazi affiliation and has been officially designated as such and is subjected to monitoring and surveillance.   Although AfD has made gains in recent elections and came in second, it is not supported by the majority of German people. About 70% oppose them overall.",PsychLegalMind,2025-05-03T11:12:39,23
You know what‚Äôs tyranny? Deporting people without a fair trial to a death camp in Venezuela!,dschazam,2025-05-03T11:18:51,19

Can Rubio focus on tyranny in disguise in the US?,kupomu27,2025-05-03T16:26:55,3
The German government which is controlled by an opposing political party has declared a rival an extremist group because they don‚Äôt like the fact that they have competition.   Many of AfD‚Äôs platform policies are common sense and should be a priority for the German people.,TexasInsights,2025-05-03T14:50:41,-28
"No, they oppose fascists because they are fascists, and Germany has a very recent memory of what happens when you tolerate fascists.",HoorayItsKyle,2025-05-03T16:08:53,13
The decision was made by an independent intelligence agency which is statutorily obligated to make assessments like this. It has nothing to do with not liking competition and there are in fact other opposition parties besides the AfD.  Also this report on its own will not prevent the party from contesting elections or anything like that.,Karmonit,2025-05-03T19:43:44,9
"You mean the report started 3 years ago under an entirely different government? From an independent agency? That report?   AfD is a far-right and extremist organisation, this has been confirmed at some state and local levels in multiple court cases and now by an independent report at the federal level.",The_Knife_Pie,2025-05-03T20:58:13,5
If AfD wants to make a real difference it must be able to influence the populations at large that can break the fire wall. Otherwise it will remain on the sideline.,PsychLegalMind,2025-05-03T16:50:40,1
"They have some very common sense policies that need to be adopted before Germany becomes a completely different and worse country.   The current trajectory of Germany, be it in 50 or 100 years, is to for people who have absolutely no dedication to freedom or democracy to take over and impose their religious dogma on the people.",TexasInsights,2025-05-03T16:19:08,-19
The BfV is not independent. Its members are appointed by the Interior Ministry which is staffed and headed by many members appointed by the current government. They also report directly to BMI.,TexasInsights,2025-05-03T19:52:12,-1

"They‚Äôre making progress. They got 20% of the last vote and should continue to make gains.   I think the German people, along with much of the West, have seen how the regular people have been taken advantage over the last 50 or so years and recognize the need to place some common sense limits on the excesses of political and campus liberalism.",TexasInsights,2025-05-03T17:52:20,-2
"No. This is nazi propaganda.  And you will lose, just like they did",HoorayItsKyle,2025-05-03T16:23:58,16
">The current trajectory of Germany, be it in 50 or 100 years, is to for people who have absolutely no dedication to freedom or democracy to take over and impose their religious dogma on the people.  Sounds like what is currently happening in the US. Every accusation is a confession",Im_a_knitiot,2025-05-04T02:10:31,3
"The head is a political appointee, but the ""members"" (no such thing as members of a federal agency, they are employees) are career employees and they can't just make decisions willy-nilly. Plus the AfD is free to sue the over the report if it feels like it's unfairly represented. They will lose of course, because it's all true.",Karmonit,2025-05-03T19:54:51,7
"This is just an outright lie my dude. The SPD were the main ruling party in a coalition with the Greens and the FDP before the elections held literally this year. During which the CDU/CSU won and became the largest party and plan to form a grand coalition with the SPD. That is to say, two different coalitions headed by two different parties.",The_Knife_Pie,2025-05-04T10:07:02,1
"If you are talking about Trump, many segments of those who voted for him now have buyers remorse and he has lost much credibility with independent voters even with respect to immigration and economy, two of his previously stronger points. He is under water.",PsychLegalMind,2025-05-03T19:27:12,5
Incorrect.   The demand that immigrants integrate into German society is not an unreasonable one.   Rejecting Sharia is also not unreasonable.  Rejecting intervention in foreign wars is not unreasonable.   Rejecting media censorship is not unreasonable.   Rejecting EU regulation and erosion of sovereignty is not unreasonable.   Rejecting endless bailouts of countries that make poor economic decisions is not unreasonable.   Promoting a higher birth rate is not unreasonable.   Promoting domestic energy production is not unreasonable.   What exactly are you calling Nazi-ism? Just anything that you oppose? Anyone that says something contrary to the political opinions that you are spoon-fed by the media and biased  professors?,TexasInsights,2025-05-03T16:34:54,-16
"So, that‚Äôs another way for you to admit that the BfV is not independent. Got it.   They are challenging. And of course they‚Äôll lose. But not because they‚Äôre an ‚Äúextremist‚Äù group.",TexasInsights,2025-05-03T19:58:09,1
"I‚Äôm only speaking about AfD since that was the topic of the article.   To the extent that other nations in the West share these sentiments, I agree.   Donald Trump has nothing to do with my views or my comment.",TexasInsights,2025-05-03T19:30:00,1
"This is more or less word for word Nazi propaganda about Jews in the 1930s.  No, I am not calling anyone who opposes me a nazi. I am calling you, specifically, for using anti-immigration populism with an appeal to cultural nationalism.  And you know it, you're pretending not to know it, and I'm simply reminding you that you're not fooling anybody and you will lose.",HoorayItsKyle,2025-05-03T18:23:24,12
I did not admit that. In fact I explicitly said the opposite.  They'll lose because they are extremist and it's obvious to everyone. They have no reasonable claim otherwise.,Karmonit,2025-05-03T19:59:57,7
"Your comment is insulting, incorrect, and disingenuous.",TexasInsights,2025-05-03T18:26:35,-1
You‚Äôre either lying or just refuse to admit you‚Äôre wrong.   It‚Äôs ok. üëç,TexasInsights,2025-05-03T20:00:43,1
Your outrage is fake and amusing.,HoorayItsKyle,2025-05-03T18:27:12,16
Neither. An agency being led by a political appointee does not inherently make it non-independent. That's what you fail to understand.,Karmonit,2025-05-03T20:04:15,5
You still didn‚Äôt really respond. None of the things I listed which were AfD platform points are wrong in the slightest.,TexasInsights,2025-05-03T18:29:35,1
I think you‚Äôre the one failing to understand. There‚Äôs no way that politics aren‚Äôt involved when the head of the agency tasked with designating extremist groups is a member of the political party most politically threatened by the very group examined. Germans aren‚Äôt above petty political intrigue.,TexasInsights,2025-05-03T20:08:26,1
Majority of Germany seems to disagree.,DevilahJake,2025-05-03T19:12:05,8
"Sorry, but you have absolutely no clue what you are talking about. President of BfV is always a Person who had a carreer in Goverment administration. In Germany we do not put some guy from a completely different profession in this place only because he is in favor of our political ideas. Also the AFD does not have problems because of the ideas you mentioned but because of how they want to achieve them and thereby will violate constitutional laws. Also many of there polititians even in high leading positions have ties to Neonazis or did use nazi symbols and quotes, E.G. Bj√∂rn H√∂cke. In Germany this is against our Constitution, so BfV is just doing it's job. AFD may be on the rise, but they will never be able to pull the same stunt like in the US, because we have more than two parties of political importance.",Striking_Bad_7844,2025-05-03T21:06:07,7
They got the second highest percentage of votes. In a parliamentary system you‚Äôre not likely to get an outright majority.,TexasInsights,2025-05-03T19:14:17,1
"Finally a better answer.   But no, the career bureaucrats play political games too. And the party that makes the appointment still gets to pick their man even if they limit themselves to a smaller pool of candidates.   Thank you for acknowledging that the AfD platform is actually full of valid political goals.   The problem is that since is the case, the other parties should also be addressing these points and aggressively pursuing them.   The fact that they have neglected their duty to do so has caused people to create the AfD out of necessity.   And yes, like the US Republican Party, some real crappy people get into office. Acknowledged and a point I‚Äôll give to you. But the fact remains that their points are valid.   The Constitution, either of the US or Germany, is not so untouchable that people have to sit back and let the nation collapse out of reverence. Abraham Lincoln expressed this sentiment during his time as US President and I believe it also holds true for Germany today.",TexasInsights,2025-05-03T21:21:14,1
"My statement stands, majority of Germany does not agree with AfD.",DevilahJake,2025-05-03T19:20:50,6
"By that logic, a majority of Germans does not agree with any party. Thats not a really insightful observation.",TexasInsights,2025-05-03T19:28:00,1
