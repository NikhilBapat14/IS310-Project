"This latest pathetic move by Trump comes as no surprise. He once said his handicapped great nephew should be left to die. During the contruction of his Tower in NYC, he did not want any handicap aids installed such as ramps, support railings, or Braille signage. During his 1st term he did not want to attend a handicap sporting event, because he could not stomach watching those kids and people compete. Trump is not human.",Pixburghman,2025-04-24T17:53:53,20
"   Snippet:  >If the Trump administration and the so-called ‚ÄúDepartment of Government Efficiency‚Äù (DOGE) have their way, the basic educational and human rights of students with disabilities will soon be eviscerated. Due to the planned demolition of the Department of Education, the rights of students with disabilities to ‚Äúa free, appropriate public education‚Äù ‚Äî guaranteed by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) ‚Äî are under fire.  >For nearly 50 years, the Department of Education (DOE) has been responsible for distributing funds ‚Äî¬†[$14.2 billion in fiscal year 2025¬†](https://hechingerreport.org/how-could-project-2025-change-education/)‚Äî to state and local school districts to enable them to educate students with a range of disabilities.   >Among other things, this money goes toward training teachers, service providers, and other staff in best practices for both special and general education classrooms. It also goes toward coordinating research and record keeping; providing technical assistance; and doing outreach to parents and caregivers to make sure they know their rights.   >The Trump administration is attacking all of these functions with its plan to dismantle the Department of Education.",Silent-Resort-3076,2025-04-24T17:03:50,8

"‚ÄúIn fact, 17 states (Alabama, Arkansas, Alaska, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah and West Virginia) are currently suing the U.S. government, asking that it declare Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 unconstitutional.  Section 504 prohibits institutions that receive federal funds from discriminating against or excluding people with disabilities from programs or services. Then there‚Äôs IDEA, which is also squarely in the right‚Äôs crosshairs, since it guarantees every child access to public schooling.‚Äù  I‚Äôm so sick and tired of this.",Nobodygrotesque,2025-04-25T01:33:36,8
"1934 Nazi Germany called this the T-4 program. One where the disabled were financially and systemically removed from society and catalogued (eg Kennedy‚Äôs mental disability ‚Äúregistry‚Äù).  Eventually the disabled were ‚Äúhelped‚Äù into finding a peaceful final solution by way of physician supported assisted euthanasia. Often by ‚Äúhumanly‚Äù placing them in hospital gas chambers, or through mass starvation. Not unlike the MAID program in Canada that the Trump administration is so keenly interested in.  The Nazi T4 program was later expanded.",Random-Name-7160,2025-04-25T02:42:51,6
