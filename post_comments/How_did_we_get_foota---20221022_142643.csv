"Nothing done in the Chinese Communist Party is unscripted. By publicly removing Hu, Xi is indicating that all policies under Hu's watch can be revised and questioned. Imagine if they did this to Mao publicly. Would he still be venerated as the father of modern China today?  No, he would be seen as a pathetic figure, incompetent in the worst way. That is who Hu is painted to be from now on.   Xi destroyed Hu's legacy among all eyes in China today.  Further, he understands the optics better than anyone. Under his approval, this footage was publicly released, so far as Western media was concerned.  The more nuanced question is what message was Xi signaling to the west, and to whom in particular?",gomi-panda,2022-10-22T15:57:20,1
