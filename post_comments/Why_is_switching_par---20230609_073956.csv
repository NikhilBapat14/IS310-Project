"It isn't that she switched parties.   It is that she is voting close to opposite of how she told constituents she would vote.    For example. If she was mostly a Democrat in the way she voted, except for being pro life, if she went Republican because she couldn't deal with being in a party that accepted abortion, I get that.  But she ran as a typical Democrat, won because she said this is how she would represent people, then said, I lied, ha ha, and voted like a typical Republican, That isn't acceptable.   Should Democrats run people in red areas, have them tell Republicans what they want to hear, get elected then vote blue?   Of course not.",chinmakes5,2023-06-12T11:22:05,12
"In the USA we vote for people, not parties.  In my observation that means the republican and democratic parties act as coalitions rather than true parties working towards a stared platform.  So voting for a person based on their party seems useless to me anyway.  I would much prefer to vote for a party platform, have each party get seats based on how many votes they got, and have the ruling coalition form based on which parties can work together. Then we could have (1) more diverse parties and (2) some required cooperation across party bounds.",jack_ftw,2023-06-12T11:13:15,15
"American electoral systems have a history of minimizing the *de jure* involvement of political parties. That's somewhat different these days, but its still the prevailing legal assumption that voters elect candidates —people, not parties— to act on their behalf in the legislature. There's no requirement or assumption that those candidates affiliate with any political party, so of course there's no extra obligation to *remain* in a political party if you happened to be a party member when you were elected.  Here's a scenario: A Republican candidate gets elected and, once in office, they start talking like a Democrat. They haven't changed parties or caucuses or anything, they're just a Republican with Democratic opinions that nobody knew about until after they took office. Did they do something deceptive and dishonest? Yes, I'd say so. But did they do anything illegal? No, not really. All they did was change their political opinions. We can't pass laws that require any to think or act a certain way, even if they are a slimeball politician who lied to their voters.  And since party affiliation in the U.S. is really nothing more than a label for somebody's political opinions, we can't really force someone to stay in one party, even if they were elected to office under dishonest pretenses. Legally, party affiliation is considered a individual matter. I mean, imagine if there was a law preventing Tricia Cotham from officially switching parties like she did. There would be nothing stopping her from voting however she'd like while remaining a Democrat and giving Republicans a working majority anyways.  The solution is not to pass sloppy laws mandating party membership for X amount of years or whatever. It's just to vote for honest people and vote out people who reveal themselves to be dishonest.",animaguscat,2023-06-12T11:24:51,4

"So there are countries where, if a politician changes parties or even votes against the party leadership, they are removed from parliament. These are usually countries with some form of party-list proportional representation, where there is the next candidate ""on the list"" waiting to replace them immediately. Even in countries like Canada and the UK which has the same electoral system as us but much stronger political parties (and party switching and especially expulsion, is more common), there are often calls for a politician to resign if they switch parties. You also have the Philippines, which is a weird case where most politicians end a term with a different party than when they started, and it's becoming a problem (the Philippines has a very weird electoral system, but that's a different story).   In theory, I don't think it's a bad idea to have an automatic recall vote if a politician switches parties. The problem with recall votes, though, where they usually have incredibly low turnout, which makes them pretty easily manipulated by special interests.",loselyconscious,2023-06-13T16:04:33,2
The most recent example of the latter I can think of is when in 2009 Republican Senator Arlen Specter switched to the Democratic party. He would go on to narrowly lose his re-election primary to Democratic Representative Joe Sestak in 2010.,bored291,2023-06-13T17:21:53,2
"Because Freedom of Association is a thing. Keep in mind, it rarely happens (in the grand scheme of things) in the middle of them serving, and rarely does it give a political party a supermajority in a legislative body. The parties are largely unregulated as to who can join and who can leave, and it’s a very informal process. Parties are also not always written into law; many statutes reference “majority” or “minority” because the party names can change and parties can rise and fall. The Democrats could call themselves the National Party of Liberty and Freedom tomorrow (assuming all the paperwork is filed correctly as a political organization) and they would still be the “majority” in the Senate and the “minority” in the House. The GOP could change their platform in 2024 to be even more progressive than the Democrats, and there is zero law regulating that, afaik.",Zeddo52SD,2023-06-14T15:10:35,2

I feel it is wrong but in America you do have the right to peacefully assemble which implies that you can choose what political party you’re aligned with. IMO preventing them from doing would violate that. But I can also hear the argument that people voted for a Dem or Rep and someone switching parties violates that vote. That being said if you’re switching parties youre probably already politically aligned that way so people should be informed enough to see your voting record/policy stances.  I know in AZ after McCain died the governor had to appoint a Republican to replace him and could not appoint a Democrat. It’s in the state constitution I believe?

That all sounds great except a great deal of the parliamentary process is based on the party to which a legislator belongs. Either parliamentary process or party membership rules needs to change otherwise it’s just gamesmanship.,bgplsa,2023-06-12T11:25:16,5

What??. What if they voted based on constituency desires that conflicted with the party line?

What stops you from registering with the opposing party for the primary?,AlexKingstonsGigolo,2023-06-18T21:21:43,1
"Yes, because in these, people vote for parties, not individuals. This is often literally the case. In party-list proportional representation, people literally vote for a party. The Party has a list of candidates, and however many seats the party wins (determined by the proportion of votes it receives), then that number of members from its list get elected.   These countries either have really big constituencies or no constituencies at all (just one vote for the entire country). That's the case where leaving or being expelled from a party means forfeiting your seat.   Even in a country like The UK or Britain, where people do vote for candidates, the Prime Minister (the equivalent to the President) is (more or less) the leader of the party with the most seats. If a Prime Minister loses the support of their party, they stop being Prime Minister. (That's why the United Kingdom is on its third Prime Minister from the same party without having a single election). So maintaining the ""discipline of the party"" is really important for the leader.  Politicians in these parties do buck the party leadership frequently, and sometimes it works, but they face much heavier consequences for it than in the US.  In the United States, we get to vote separately for President and Congress. In most countries, that's not the case. They vote for the Prime Minister by voting for the local candidate of the party whose leader they support.  So, a local candidate bucking party leadership in a really dramatic way is more likely to be rejected by voters because they sometimes feel like they voted for the leader, not the local candidate. That's not always the case, but it is more common than in the US.",loselyconscious,2023-12-06T01:57:36,1
