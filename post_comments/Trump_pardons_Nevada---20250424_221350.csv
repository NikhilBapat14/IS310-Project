"K but like‚Ä¶ as much as I feel for you (if you‚Äôre American), you could totally fight back on a way more petty level. Honestly, why aren‚Äôt you crowdsourcing money to run digital advertising campaigns on this kind of shit that leads back to worthwhile causes and generates PPC money?

The dems can‚Äôt keep up with it and would never do this. But if I were being a little unhinged (as an ex digital marketer & also a Canadian, so not really my place to start it) I‚Äôd start a grassroots campaign just flooding MAGA-heavy areas with super shareable, fact-checked content that doesn‚Äôt look like it‚Äôs from ‚Äúthe libs.‚Äù Go check the other sub for ways to write headings that get shared. Just confuse them.   Like:  - Meme-driven posts that feel organic and homemade - targeted ad buys in deep red zones - Stuff that sounds like it‚Äôs coming from inside the house ‚Äî someone who‚Äôs ‚Äújust asking questions‚Äù or ‚Äústarting to wonder‚Äù  If you make it look like a frustrated uncle finally cracking, people will share it. MAGA folks eat that kind of ‚Äúpersonal awakening‚Äù content up, especially if it‚Äôs subtle enough not to trigger defenses.
