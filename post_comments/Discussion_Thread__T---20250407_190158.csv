"If the tariffs aren’t the thing that finally destroys Trump then basically nothing can. We’re gonna see probably the biggest decrease in standard of living in this countries history. I’m of the belief that this will either completely destroy Trump, possibly to the point he isn’t even president come the end of the year or he’ll somehow make it though unscathed like with so many of his other controversies. If the latter is the case then it would mean that his cult is solidified enough that he could genuinely become an outright dictator if he wanted to, we’re talking staying president for the rest of his life and ruling by decree while still maintaining the support of his base.",Single_Criticism9042,2025-04-07T19:13:54,1
"I'm predicting that Trump announces some pivot/retreat in which he claims victories in some country-trade deficit bullshit, around 4 p.m. or so tomorrow, before the evening news, after the market closes.  Today's market activity danced around crazy as soon as there was false word of a Trump relent on tariffs. Tomorrow will likely show continued sour response to Trump's gambit, and the potential momentum towards Congress re-taking the tariff role will necessitate Trump to retreat, temporarily.",localistand,2025-04-07T19:20:44,1
"There is no way we can produce products here and sell them for a cheap price. And... it would take years to happen.  Our material costs alone are more than what it costs to import.  Sure, it would be nice. But it isn't feasible on most products. Look at Adidas; they tried to manufacture here and failed.",SAJ-13,2025-04-07T19:26:36,1

"Is it possible that billionaires are actually unhappy with Trump because they thought they could control him but can't because he is siloed by yes men, has complete control of most of the government, and is backed by his ravenous cult?

"I was interested to see that India thinks they can make a deal with Trump to get their tariffs reduced.  China is definitely hoping this happens because China will then move production to India to serve the US market. No way China moves production lines to America with their minimum wage - but India is another story. China moves their US bound production to India, still pays crap wages and avoids safety regulations, and sends goods to America with the reduced tariffs that India negotiates.

"It’s crazy to me that of all the things they’ve done, the tariffs are the ones that are really freaking everyone out.",FawningDeer37,2025-04-07T19:08:37,1
"Other autocrats seem to understand that they can get away with endless corruption, lawlessness, incompetence, and scapegoating of minorities as long as they manage to keep the majority of people fat and happy enough for their day to day lives to continue on uninterrupted. Picking people off one by one might fly under the radar, but attacking people at a population level could provoke a major backlash. This is why we don’t really see any widespread pushback against Orban and why an evil sociopath like Bukele is so popular.   But Trump has overreached with the tariffs by making *everyone* suffer indiscriminately. No one in the U.S. directly feels the impact of him berating Zelenskyy. The effect of gutting things like cancer research and environmental protections won’t be felt for some time (enough time for him and his sycophants to muddy the waters and blame Obama or Biden). Even atrocities like deporting innocent people to Bukele’s concentration camp will go unseen and unquestioned by those who don’t care about the rule of law and don’t pay attention to the news. But people will notice when they are laid off and they start to panic because groceries were straining their budget even when they had a job. They will notice when businesses shutter all around them, crime spikes, and they start losing their homes. Remember, most Americans live paycheck to paycheck and don’t even have 4 months’ worth of emergency savings. They will notice and it won’t take long for them to understand who is responsible for it, and unlike a lot of what he has gotten away with so far, Trump is going to have to fully own this one. Tariffs are one thing he has been absolutely consistent about. He has been talking about tariffs for ten years. He campaigned on it, he implemented it, and the effects were immediate. There is no plausible deniability there and nowhere for him to hide. He might be able to ride it out for a couple of months by promising things will get better, but Americans don’t have that kind of patience even in the best of times.   Yoon similarly overreached in South Korea when he declared martial law and punished the entire population. The people decided they had enough and forced him out. I doubt Trump supporters will ever turn on him, but plenty of the idiots who stayed home or have always been privileged enough to “not care about politics” will change their tune once they lose that privilege.",Mewnicorns,2025-04-07T20:56:22,1

"Also, it will never be cheaper for the consumer, just a larger profit margin for companies. If an average imported washer and dryer shoots up from $600 to $1200, and some domestic company figures out how to manufacture it at the original price point, do you really think they'll sell it for $600? No way in hell. They'll price it at $1200 because that's what the market will bear, and they can double or triple their profit margin.  Of course, that assumes they can get labor cheap enough to compete, the tariffs on imported parts don't blow up the production costs, and we haven't descended into poverty and civil unrest in the years it would take to setup such a production facility.  It's pure fantasy. Or nightmare fuel I guess.",jubblernut,2025-04-07T21:28:20,1
