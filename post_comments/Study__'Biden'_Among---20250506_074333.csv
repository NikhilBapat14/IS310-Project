The bumbling idiot couldn't answer a single question without it immediately turning into a hate-filled obsessive rant about Biden. Every single answer followed the format:   1. I did the best thing anyone has ever seen on (insert unrelated topic)  2. Biden couldn't do it  3. Biden wasn't smart enough to do it  4. The 2020 election was rigged by Biden  5.

">In the Trump White House's first 100 days, “Biden” was the fifth most frequently used word, according to a TIME analysis of transcripts of his public remarks and those of key spokespeople. The former President’s last name was uttered more than “border” and just less than the word “deal.” The most frequently used word was “great,” followed by “American” and “tariff.” To come up with the tally, TIME used an AI algorithm to analyze 92 events where Trump made on-camera remarks as well as press briefings his top officials held at the White House.  Here’s a post compressing all of trump’s favorite words in one place: The Fake News is a TOTAL disaster—losers everywhere! But we’re WINNING like never before. The wall? Beautiful. The crowds?

"I'm curious, are you saying this as a Trump supporter or someone who just wanted Democrats to run someone differently?  Understand from the perspective of people like me who knew Biden was old in 2020; who knew that both geriatrics Trump and Biden are liabilities and whose senility expresses itself in different aspects.  I can for instance point to numerous instances ranging from Trump falling asleep, to tripping, to saying outright gibberish both on Twitter and in monologue speech (remember the nuclear engineer speech that makes zero sense?).  But at the end of the day, yes: Biden was in decline. But it was a strategic choice to look past that because between an old guy who doesn't try to usurp democracy and isn't a convicted felon pending 3 further criminals trials and a slightly better composed old guy by the optics as skewed through right-wing media who is trying to usurp democracy and is a convicted felon pending 3 criminal trials, I'll take the former every time. For anyone with (1) Critical-thinking skills, (2) Empathy, and (3) Time to parse the muddied waters of information, this was an easy choice.  All that being said, I wanted Biden to commit to being a 1-term President, and I thought anyone who tried to pretend Biden's decline wasn't a problem post-debate in June last year was batshit crazy. I was very happy when Harris took the nomination. But I put much of the blame on Biden for the 2024 loss and having only given Democrats 12 weeks to work with.

"> I expect the fact that he can 'only win against women' and lost the one time he ran against a man annoys him to no end.  I'd thought about this as well, and I hate to say it, but I think it's correct. There's a lot of sexist people in the US who simply won't vote for a woman. No matter how much more qualified she is than her male opponent.   I think that's a big part of why he got a larger share of the Muslim vote than in 2020, and likely explains much of his increase among latinos as well.",blacksheep998,2025-05-06T10:41:50,25
"Honestly I really wish more discussion would be had about the fact that Trump is the only republican who was run for POTUS in the general election since the GOP had their consent decree to not try and suppress voters ended in 2013.  In 2024 someone did look into the effects of those efforts post 2020 and it’s quite likely that without those efforts, Kamala would have won. I’d wager the same is true of Hillary in 2016.",aelysium,2025-05-06T11:31:02,5
It sucks so much that people will not vote for a woman. I think Walz would've had a great chance to win even if it was very narrowly so. Pretty much any straight white male under 70 could've been a strong counter. Kamala was also directly tied to Biden as his VP which further hurt her. ,Due-Egg4743,2025-05-06T22:47:02,2

I actually had an epihany about the water pressure stuff standing in a hotel shower this morning with shitty water pressure. Trump basically spends his entire life on his own properties. He's been known for stiffing contractors and his properties cut corners. I'm guessing he thinks water pressure is an issue because all his properties have shitty water pressure.,ThisKidIsAlright,2025-05-06T22:20:51,7
