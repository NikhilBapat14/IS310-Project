"If she‚Äôs talking about AI that is insane. Kids that age need personal support that shows them they have the ability to learn in a supportive, caring environment. They also learn from each other. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I had another student re-explain something to another child I hadn‚Äôt thought of. Learning in a group is stimulating to everyone in the room. Life is collaborating with others no matter how old you are.",No-Bench-3582,2025-04-09T22:55:22,14
"Plenty of intelligent yet quite poor people of all ages are learning shitloads about AI in order to try and understand how it's going to affect their lives and whether or not they're even going to have careers moving forward (maybe not). They wake up every day and read tons about AI and experiment with using it and a lot of what they find out scares the shit out of them.  And then there's her, the literal Secretary of Education and a billionaire calling it ""A1"".  This is the world we now live in, God help us all!",Mysterious_Eye6989,2025-04-10T03:29:59,9

"I miss the days when Stone Cold Steve Austin would come out, give everyone with a microphone a stunner, drink some beer, and leave everything in chaos.  We have a highly inexperienced, an unqualified, person ruining the Dept of Education, doesn't know what AI is, is not remotely attuned with the agency, its function, or anything else education related, lied about having a degree, and is alleged to have covered up for people on her staff committing crimes against children in the WWE.  This was the best the Republican party had for the Dept of Education.  How far down the list do you have to go before you arrive here? The very bottom.",Ayste,2025-04-10T07:33:32,6

"Teachers, themselves,  are supporting AI tech platforms/ ability that will put them out of a job.   I heard B Gates predict the future where there was no teaching profession b/c of AI.

Everyone is knocking her without understanding the context as part of an initiative to overhaul school lunch programs. A school system will allow A1 Steak Sauce for 1st Graders and Pre-K as a condiment.

"AI is not some obscure acronym like ""SCUBA"" or ""LASER"" or ""GULAG"", where it's perfectly reasonable to not understand what it stands for. AI is an extremely simple initialism and not having any understanding of what it stands for is like not bothering to learn what DIY or ATM or BBQ stand for. It's indicative of extreme intellectual laziness.  Or, to put it another way, the word ""intelligence"" is not spelled with a ""one"" and the damn Secrety ov Educashun should probably know that!",Mysterious_Eye6989,2025-04-10T03:42:57,5
