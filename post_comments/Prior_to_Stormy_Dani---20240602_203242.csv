"No, he was not reimbursing them as part of the agreement. Though he did attempt to purchase the rights to the Karen McDougall story from them, Pecker himself cancelled that sale.  From the sounds of things, Pecker genuinely wanted Trump to be president and was willing to use his influence and money to help make that happen. The hush money he paid for other stories in the catch-and-kill scheme may have constituted an illegal campaign contribution -- one that was specifically known by and coordinated with the Trump campaign via Michael Cohen.  The Enquirer's parent company AMI (of which Pecker was CEO) was under federal investigation for this, and the FBI raided Pecker's home in 2018. Meanwhile he was trying to sell the Enquirer to another media company, but the buyers demanded a condition that the investigation had to be resolved in order for the sale to proceed.   Pecker/AMI reached a non-prosecution agreement with the FBI in which they agreed to cooperate fully with law enforcement investigations in exchange for not being prosecuted themselves. This is how Pecker ended up on the stand testifying against Trump   As for the Stormy Daniels story, Pecker said he declined to buy this one because of how much money she wanted, how much they'd already paid for the other stories, and because he didn't want the Enquirer to be associated with a porn star. (For comparison, they paid the doorman 30k for his story about the alleged illegitimate child; Stormy was asking for 120k). But he did alert Cohen that she was trying to sell the story, and said he should buy the rights himself.",Doctor_Worm,2024-06-03T06:38:17,6
