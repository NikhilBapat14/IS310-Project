"I can answer this to a degree.  There is *decades* long institutional dissatisfaction across much of the country, especially in areas that were devastated by Nixon + Reagan. I grew up in Indiana, and everyone except for rich suburbanites has been furious about this my whole life. The farmers were torn apart by Earl Buttz. Aside from a few unions holding on, unions were functionally outlawed so long ago that most people don't even know what they are. Cities are post-industrial shambles of what they were and urban profits are all siphoned off by the state to other regions. Urban, rural, white, nonwhite, middle class, working class...people may point to slightly different things in their complaints, but all these people *hate* the status quo and have since 2000 at least, usually the 80s/90s.  These concerns have gone unaddressed for so long by both parties that political engagement just breaks. How couldn't it? So people start desperately looking for any candidate who promises change. Barack Hussein Obama, a black man with an Arabic-origin name, flipped red Indiana blue for the first time in 44 years running a heavy change campaign. Indiana was the center of the 2nd-wave Klan movement and *this* was the candidate we flipped for. I don't know how our party didn't get the memo that people were ***desperate*** for change after that.  But those root concerns never got addressed. Those people are still desperate for change today, even more bitter because it's been 17 years since they threw a hail mary for Obama and things have only gotten worse. So now in 2025, people are so feverishly desperate for change and so fed up with our institutions that they'll jump onboard with basically anyone who acknowledges the current system sucks and says they're going to fix it in meaningful ways. For baffling reasons, Dems have been refusing to acknowledge the pain and haven't pitched any solutions at...any time in my lifetime, really, and I'm almost 40.  That's why we got Trump, that's why he can chew up and spit out any status-quo candidate who doesn't acknowledge these issues, and that's why people are so desperately clinging onto him.",Sminahin,2025-05-02T10:26:47,35

So they think whatever they have to put up with right now is just a stepping stone on their path to the top, and may actually speed up their ascent because it could slow down others more than them.  Therein lies a big part of the messaging problem.  They're fundamentally looking at the issues from a different point of view on what the end result should be.  Like, trying to travel through a forest.  They might see the best route to get from point A to point B is to clear-cut and burn down sections to pave a highway would make it easier for them to get to the other side, regardless of what it leaves in their wake for anyone traveling after them.

"> These concerns have gone unaddressed for so long by both parties that political engagement just breaks.   You say they've been unaddressed, but Democrats routinely put forward proposals to help, only to have Republicans slap down those proposals.

You say that Trump said he was going to fix things, but what policies did he actually propose? And of the policies he proposed, which of them would be even remotely positive for rural voters? The vast majority of what he says is vague generalities, obvious lies, and complaints about his own personal grievances. But he definitely did talk about being the embodiment of their retribution. If rural voters just want retribution, then I'd much rather people just be honest about that.

">You say they've been unaddressed, but Democrats routinely put forward proposals to help, only to have Republicans slap down those proposals.  You're right but also this is irrelevant. The reason you think it's relevant is partisan brain. You need to zoom out and approach this like someone not cheerleading us Dems like we're a sports team. Because we still haven't delivered, and that's what people care about more than studying the past to carefully proportion blame.  Republicans did all these awful things. But they did them so long ago that the original victims have often died of old age--I honestly think that's an intentional part of their plan to win the long game. Early Buttz was wrecking rural America from 1971-1976. That's also around when Nixon screwed healthcare. That was *49 years ago* even going to the most recent date. You have to be 67+ to have experienced that shift in your adult life. Tim Walz is too young for that cutoff. Almost as bad for Reagan stuff.  We Dems have been ignoring issues like these for literal generations. You need a serious understanding of American political history to even understand what happened. I have a Polisci degree. I bet a lot of other people in this room do, which is why we all think this is so obvious. Who goes to college for political science again? This is a key reason why we Dems are becoming a class-gated party.  So when this awful status quo has been the only things many people know their whole lives...and one side acknowledges the obvious and makes snake-oil promises, while the other just relies on the political history knowledge of the electorate to make sure everyone knows we're secretly better even if we look worse...  >You say that Trump said he was going to fix things, but what policies did he actually propose?

I'm too damn tired to have people lying about what motivates them.  If you think literally any of this is relevant, then you do not understand the issue. I'm sorry. You are injecting complexity that only confuses an issue that's very, very simple.  People broadly don't like Republicans, and yes that includes people voting for Republicans. But Republicans acknowledge the grievance. We don't, even when everybody is looking at us expectantly. Oh, and you mentioned the social issue? This is why the culture war issue has gotten so bad and devastating for Dems. Because people waiting in line 50 years for their turn to have their issue acknowledged have watched us give attention to every issue under the sun except this obvious struggle. So when we keep ignoring the clear economic/structural issues while celebrating social causes (the only front our party reliably has achievements in), it sends an unflattering message with easy scapegoats ready to go.",Sminahin,2025-05-02T12:27:02,8

"Thought of a better way to frame my response. Sorry for double.  We are a failed party in a failing state. Republicans are *also* a failed party, but their form of decay has been much more malicious. The fact that Republicans are a malicious failed party does not mean that we are a successful or good party, and it definitely does not mean that we look good. In fact, our particular form of decay right now makes us look worse than Republicans at first glance (because we refuse to engage the defining issue of the last \~half century).  We're essentially asking the electorate to go out and eyeball two asteroids to guesstimate which one would make for a less devastating strike. I can do that, even if I hate that I have to. I grew up with my family reading the newspaper at the kitchen table, family full of teachers, and I went to school for politics for 7 years. I am capable of eyeballing those two political asteroids to see which one would be more damaging. This is not a reasonable expectation for the general electorate, especially those who are in panic mode about the apocalyptic event (failing state).

"Jesus Christ, how do you not get it. This is why we're losing.  The status quo sucks and we keep pretending it's rosy. That right there invalidates literally everything you wrote, every counterpoint. *Anybody* who acknowledges the current state sucks is going to have a massive advantage over someone who doesn't. There's a reason the more anti-establishment branded candidate (yes, including Bush vs Gore/Kerry) has won every single election since the 80s except 2020, and even that's debatable 'cuz Covid weirdness.  2016 is another stark example. We get so sucked up in discussing whether Bernie could've won the general or how much the party meddled that we miss the *obvious* question. Bernie was an incredibly weak candidate. Disqualified by age (""Reagan shows 77 was too old"" was a universal truth repeated in every Dem household I know), from a low-political-impact safe state, self-declared socialist, mid charisma. Bernie should've been a D- candidate at best. So why was he able to brawl toe-to-toe with the supposed best and brightest our party had been grooming for the presidency for \~16 years? It's because he acknowledged this and Hillary didn't. It turned what should've been a one-sided stomp into a serious primary.  >It's funny how everyone expects Democrats to make the changes for good going forward but yet vote for Republicans that either just obstruct or do nothing.  Missing. The. Point. Republicans act like they understand the change assignment. We Dems don't. Therefore it doesn't matter how much better we've been if you dig into the political history--we're literally running on not doing the thing everyone wants.  >Why are Democrats held to such a high standard and blamed constantly whenever Republicans in these areas have had the majority of power for decades?  Two separate questions here. First of all, we hold ourselves to an incredibly lousy standard. We hold ourselves to high standards for plenty of less important things, but this is the big one and we hold ourselves to a nonexistent standard. Because we won't even acknowledge the issue, by and large. Doesn't matter how good your standard is on X totally unrelated thing if you haven't even reached the starting line for the defining issue of the last \~60 years for many folk.  As for why we're blamed...because we make it incredibly easy for Republicans to blame us for it. Again, if you don't acknowledge the issue and the other side does...then they get to position you however they want. In many of these places, the local Dem parties withered and died decades ago, so the only real messaging comes from the national level. It's a total messaging vacuum the Republican party grew up. And what messages do come through from the national party don't help us none. I grew up working Dem campaigns in Indiana, and I can tell you the national party messaging was a complete liability, a ball and chain we had to struggle against.  **Also**, Republicans have stalled out so long that most of the original victims of Nixon and many even of Reagan have literally died of old age.

"Perfect example and exactly.  >So people were desperate and were willing to upset the entire apple cart with Trump because none of the conventional mainstream politicians seemed to have any answers.

"But you're politically educated, so you know that's a thing right?  I finished my degrees studying terrorism & escalations of violence--mostly in the Middle East, but some reading from all over. This is a very consistent pattern across all of human history. Things get worse, people look for someone to blame and it's easy to direct that anger into discrimination. One of the *worst* indicators of upcoming political violence was when people felt like they had no political representation or agency. Studies on terrorism in Ireland were really interesting here--in areas where people felt like they had no political voice, they were pretty alright with the IRA going brutal. When the IRA pulled similar things in areas that felt better politically represented, significant backlash. And many Americans have felt for generations like there's no real option on the ballot they can vote for.  Stop thinking in terms of American exceptionalism and start applying some of those well-established analyses to our own country. We are not immune to well-established human nature political trends just because we idealize ourselves. The higher you turn up the economic heat, the more likely any given environment is to break out in sectarian or identity-line violence. A small core of any given population may be highly resistant/immune to radicalization, but worse conditions overall lead to more people radicalizing.  Also want to point out, there are a lot of people voting against Trump *despite* their distaste for his bigotry--and many people don't know just how bad he is here. Because unless you followed NYC politics \~35 years ago and kept a close eye on the Central Park 5, you probably haven't heard of the worst displays of his racism.  Heck, I'm a queer PoC actively fighting off medical homelessness because of Anthem's predations towards my seriously ill husband. If I genuinely thought Trump could deliver on his economic promises and I didn't know he'd go hard authoritarian, I probably would've voted for him myself. Heck, I would probably take a bargain that rolled back gay marriage in exchange for economic payoffs if it meant I didn't have to worry about rent + homelessness + my partner's life every single day.

"Bang-fuckin’-on dude. Also kudos for elegantly explaining the core parasocial issue here on r/politics being an echo chamber whilst also people make something simple unnecessarily complex. The electorate cannot be expected to be as educated or aware of these histories and mechanics as we are. It may be frustrating, downright infuriating to admit, but that’s almost never going to change. This past election was about the clearest I’ve ever seen the electorate scream, transparently, the core issue that’s been the cancerous core of our political sphere for greater than 50 years: the working class struggle. Call it what you like, “The American Dream”, the “economy” etc, it’s the same at its core: the working class have been routinely getting screwed without assistance for over half a century without direct action to combat the issue and begin course correction.   Also excellent and perfectly put about the problems with Democrats in the modern context. The social issues they’ve taken up aren’t in vain per se, but they’re convenient and done so when fashionable. They’ve completely ignored the working class struggle issue while supplanting it with shifting focus between trans rights and immigration, etc. it’s not to say those aren’t important issues or classes of people needing profound help and protection, but it’s missing the forest for the trees. Solving the working class struggle and actually putting heavy, direct and visible action and work towards it will largely pave the way and provide durable foundation to solving these other social challenges. Until they do so they’ll continue to lose and so will everyday Americans. Authoritarianism and fascism rising are the death throes of a society reaching its breaking point and screaming in desperation for help by any means. We’ve ignored it to our peril and now we’re seeing it manifest in a hardcore way.   My hope is the struggle will now touch so many and so viscerally that the working class will finally rise up in a pressured way to force change both in socioeconomic terms as well as transform our government and political parties for the better.
