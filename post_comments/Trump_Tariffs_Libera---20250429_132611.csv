"And so it begins.  There will be many headlines like this to come.  Is this what winning looks like?  Is this what MAGA refers to when they say we may 'feel a little pain' before we all become rich with that sweet sweet tariff money that will SURELY trickle down?  idk guys.

"They’re consistently talking out of both sides of their mouths, saying that these tariffs won’t increase inflation, yet the math they’ve provided says otherwise.  They’re stating that they’re expecting a 25% passthrough on their tariffs, with the minimum tariff of being 10%. That’s 2.5% additional inflation at a BARE MINIMUM, which does not include what happens when they go back to their intended values.  That doesn’t even begin to go into the new stock shortages that are going to occur once supplies run low. We’re already seeing less container ships in the US from China.  Starting up new factories in the US isn’t an overnight process. That takes time. You’re going to see a lot more shock when the fantasy factories they’re imagining starting up don’t materialize before the tariff reprieve expires.  Additionally, as more countries decide to decouple from the US, that’s when the real pain happens. Those contracts aren’t coming back.  As an Aussie, we’re seeing China start sourcing raw materials from us that they would source from the US.

Those avantages will be diminished artificially due to the tariffs. And as soon as the tariffs are gone, it will be much cheaper to again send that production elsewhere. So, that means that your couple hundred million dollars and multi-year investment in the US has to be amortized over a very short period of time considering the time to actually build those. Unless the tariffs are guaranteed to last AT LEAST 10 years, it’s just not worth the gamble, so it will be cheaper to just add those to the consumer.

Dont get too hung upnon the ""did not attribute... to tariffs directly"" part as a defense - there are obvious reasons why business leaders are reluctant to make that admission, just look at what happened with Amazon yesterday when Trunp heard they were going to add a display to their site showing the cost jump due to tariffs.  Next paragraph:  >""U.S.-China trade lines comprised around 11 percent revenue in 2024, the company said, making it the UPS's most profitable trading route. However, it expects any weakening demand due to the high tariffs on China to be ""partially offset"" by growth in China to non-U. S. lanes, as well as more goods being shipped to the U.S. from other countries.""  So, a direct admission that tariffs are going to negatively harm the most profitable piece of their business, whjch will only be ""partially offset"" by other opportunities.

""UPS announced Tuesday that it would slash 20,000 jobs amid the economic chaos of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, The New York Times reported. The move, which the company said is an attempt to cut costs in an uncertain market, comes as Trump’s sky-high tariffs have driven some UPS customers to ship less, the Times reported. UPS now employs 490,000 workers, the majority of which are represented by the Teamsters Union.   The company also said that it would not be able to update its revenue forecasts for 2025 due to “macroeconomic uncertainty,” as the tariffs have roiled markets with volatility. Last year, UPS cut 12,000 jobs. In the past few months, it has searched for ways to boost revenue, such as shipping fewer packages for Amazon, its largest customer, explaining that many of those deliveries are not profitable. The company said it plans to cut the number of Amazon deliveries it makes in half over the next year.   The Times reported that UPS CEO Carol Tomé observed to investors Tuesday that the tariffs were especially hurting small companies that rely on imports from China, on which Trump has instituted a 145 percent import tax.

Not necessarily, the reason China is so competitive right now isn't just low wages it's the ecosystem they've been able to capture. If you want to manufacture something in China, they make the electronic components that goes in to the thing you want to make, they make the plastic that you need for your casing, they make the mold that you need for your casing, the screws, the screens, the trucks, the ships, everything. On top of that, they have the rare earth elements that's needed to create specific items.   That's why it's a ridiculous notion to bring all manufacturing back because it's so all encompassing, but if you ever did bring it ALL to the US, then production costs would also be way lower in the US than they are today.   But if you do that, you would have to take all the smart employees away from the tech and services sector and suddenly you have the problem with China providing all the best services instead.   What would happen if the tariffs went away, would be an offshoring process, but it wouldn't necessarily go to China, the goal would be to have more labor done in basically any country other than China because you want to spread the risk out.
