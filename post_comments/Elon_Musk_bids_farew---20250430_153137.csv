"While Musk was distracting his followers on Twitter with vague and misleading claims about his painstaking effort to eliminate ""waste"" and ""fraud"" from the government, he was also simultaneously abusing his unelected powers trying to protect his company's interests while secretly deleting information about major ""spending cuts"" from his ""wall of receipts.""  Aside from his obvious conflicts of interest, I want to take the time to illustrate how it's actually Elon Musk and DOGE who are perpetuating fraud, abusing power and mismanaging government operations.  Most of Musk's public boasts on Twitter have been inaccurate or flat out unfounded, forcing him to quietly backtrack.  Musk has taken credit for ""cutting costs"" where credit wasn't due. For instance, he bragged about cancelling contracts that weren't going to be renewed in the first place.  > David Reid, an environmental scientist in Michigan, was surprised to learn his contract studying invasive species... was included on the list. “That contract wasn’t canceled by DOGE or anyone else,” he said. The contract expired on Dec. 31 and he decided to retire and not renew it, he said. “If they took credit for canceling the contract, they’re lying.”  Musk made frequent, erratic and false claims about ""massive amounts"" of fraud, but when those claims were proven to be misleading or inaccurate, he provided little to no transparency about these mistakes and his grovelling supporters on Twitter remained unaware of just how dishonest the DOGE operation had become.  DOGE deliberately obfuscated data and quietly deleted many of its claims from its own website. And even then, its so called ""wall of receipts"" was still riddled with accounting errors, outdated data or other miscalculations.  And even as the number of errors continued to grow, the DOGE website was still increasing the total amount of savings it claims to have gleaned from its cost cutting efforts.  If you spent any time on Twitter, you would have come to the conclusion that Elon was not only driving the narrative, but his audience was taking every single word of his as a matter of fact. And whether consciously or not, they put up blinders and disregarded any information that might have contradicted Musk's claims.  One of those claims came early on in Trump's second term, when Musk stated that he had helped eliminate $55 billion (now over 100 billion) in ""government waste,"" but the math says differently. Real estimates show that the number is substantially lower. While keep in mind, many of these agencies, employees and programs that DOGE is targeting aren't even warranting scrutiny in the first place.  As far as more examples go:  Some of the contracts that DOGE claims credit for canceling were sometimes double—or even triple counted.  In at least one case, DOGE claimed that an entire contract had been canceled, when only a portion of the work was stopped. And in other cases, these contracts that DOGE claims credit for cancelling actually ended under the Biden administration.  In another more commonly reported instance, DOGE announced that it had saved $8 billion by cancelling a contract with a company providing technical support for ICE. As it turns out, the contract's actual value was $8 million.  And whether deliberately or not, DOGE was also making some serious miscalculations.   To provide an example of how they were operating this way, I'll show you a specific case where DOGE cancelled a contract for alleged ""DEI services"" for the Department of Homeland security.   They claim that by canceling this contract, they saved exactly $5.4 million.  The total cost of this contract was $7.5 million. DOGE arrived at this $5.4 million figure by subtracting an amount that had already been presumably spent.  But it's not nearly as straightforward as this. Analysts say that values like this $5.4 million spending figure are way over-estimated.  This is because spending figures are often undercounted due to the data being out of date. Something DOGE hasn't accounted for in its cancelling of similar contracts.  What's more, the numbers don't account for other costs. Like the termination costs the government will have to pay to close these contracts, making these savings estimates what one expert called a ""meaningless metric.""  Contractors will have to lay off staff, close their offices, terminate leases and get rid of equipment. This is a time consuming process that can sometimes face legal challenges.  In other words, DOGE never took these things into consideration and its math has been way off from the beginning.  But wait, there's more...  DOGE also made unrealistic estimates based on savings from terminating what are called ""umbrella contracts.""  These are larger contracts where the government sets a ""ceiling"" that represents what it's willing to spend through orders with multiple vendors. These contracts can have ceilings as high as several billion dollars.  And in a lot of cases, the total cost of orders from vendors does not reach these ceilings. But DOGE did not account for this, and instead included the entire cost of the umbrella contract in their math. In other words, it's not real money, not real savings.  Another case involved DOGE *triple* counting savings for contracts with the USAID worth hundreds of millions, and after trying to make up for this mistake, they still ended up overestimating total savings by at least $270 million.  A similar case involved a contract with the EPA for ""DEI services"" that was over counted three times as well.  In another instance, DOGE incorrectly claimed $232 million in savings through a contract with the SSA, when the actual amount was closer to $560,000.  You want to talk about fraud and mismanagement? Look no further, the call is coming from inside the house.  What's more, Elon's ""wall of receipts"" included hundreds of cases that haven't saved taxpayers *a damn thing*. For example, in one case that was listed, a contract worth $10 million with the SEC actually amounted to $0 in savings because that contract expired a year ago. It was all a scam.  Many of these cancelled contracts relate, in some form or another, to the elimination of perceived ""DEI"" programs. Most of the cancellations listed include businesses that are disproportionately run by women and minorities.  Meaning that this effort was far more ideological than strategic. Elon and his Muskrats were simply going after whatever agencies they perceived as operating under some radical left agenda.   And all the while, Musk and his supporters were failing to address, or even acknowledge the fact that his companies are subsidized to the teeth and he was taking active steps to protect his own interests.  In reality, DOGE was not acting on behalf of the American people, but was pursuing an agenda that was fueled by the right's culture wars and the narcissistic, shallow ambitions of an unelected plutocrat and his team of lackeys who all thought they were the main character in Mr. Robot.   This effort was driven by the irrational and ideological convictions of a small minority of incompetent reactionaries. There was nothing sincere, ""merit-based"" or constructive about it. One might say it's all been quite *wasteful.*",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-04-30T16:53:06,3
