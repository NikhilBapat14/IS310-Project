"That may be part of it. I mean much of his issues are because the man is a dick, if he could just not be a dick as much, it would often lessen the blow back and he would be more effective.  And knowing that is part of being an effective leader, Johnson was a tremendous prick, but he knew that and he knew when to be a dick and when not to and as a result he was effective.   If he has not been a dick to the entire fucking world and just focused on China, he would be in a much better position, but he decided to be a dick and go on some sort of revenge tour for perceived past slights, and now when he kind of needs the rest of the world, they are giving him the bird.   Expecting the country to dig deep and solder through what looks to be his fuckups as he reshapes the world economy (at least as far as he thinks he is) is a tall fucking order when he has nothing but alienate a large percentage of the countrie's population, he only got 35% of the total available votes/voters (approx 51% of those that voted) its not like he had that big a base, he just had a motivated base.

"I think the argument is often, in theory, that all these ""undesirables"" are the reason why these college students are in debt, make less than their parents, and can't get girlfriends. So when the strongman eliminates all those people, it will suddenly become a utopia where all the ""undeserving"" black people are no longer competing with them for the jobs they think they deserve, and so they will get them automatically.  Aside from the fact that none of that is how an economny actually works, they also fail to notice that they are being scammed. The redistribution of wealth that is happening is not from minorities to them, it is from *everyone* to the billionaires. They are every bit as much the economic target as the minorities are, and the social hatred is just a vehicle to convince them to vote against their own interest.",Caelinus,2025-05-02T18:48:44,9
