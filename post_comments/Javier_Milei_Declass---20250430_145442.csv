Mengele reportedly drowned in Brazil. Eichmann was captured in Argentina by the Mossad before being executed by Israel.,thenovicemechanic,2025-04-30T22:02:07,94
"But we know what happened to those people. They found Bormann's body in 1972, in Berlin. He'd died in 1945. Mengele died in Brazil in 1979, and Eichmann was executed in Israel in 1963. Do you think they had interesting lives in South America?   I rather like Hannah Arendt's idea of the ""banality of evil"" in regards to Eichmann and the bureaucracy of death.",Ecstatic-Condition29,2025-04-30T18:16:52,15
"Mengele — who died in Bertioga, Brazil, in 1979 — fled to Argentina in 1949 following the fall of Nazi Germany and never faced justice for his crimes. The local outlet Infobae reported that the declassified documents contain Argentine police reports from November 1956 detailing Mengele’s request for a correction on the name on his identity card, noting that until that moment, Mengele moved around the country with an identity card that listed him as “Gregor Helmut” from Trento, Italy.",Even-Class-4162,2025-04-30T20:18:40,5
Well eichmann and mengele we already have decent ideas on them. But there's very little evidence that boremann got out.,physical-vapor,2025-04-30T17:21:32,5
