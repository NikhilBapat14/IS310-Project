Delaying major infrastructure projects to pressure local officials into approving highly lucrative private real estate deals...  Hmmm...   Have you ever seen the movie Chinatown?,unebaguette,2022-08-27T18:45:58,5
"The federal government is constitutionally restricted from extorting state agencies to do anything specific for policy. It would be an empty threat.   What is the punishment to do? To force the city to reconsider more housing, build it and everything else or lose transit funding every state is awarded? It may not be legal to do this for anything not specific to transit also.   That violates the layers of government we rely on for different thrings.   But like funding roads, the state can be induced to comply with a policy. They can get paid more if they consider transit proximate to and to encourage housing.   But it cannot demand housing in a transit subsidy, and can’t make a state actually do something in a specific fashion for example extorting the governor and transportation agencies to build homes.   Same for charities. We cannot coerce states to adopt contrary policy. We can reward them for doing so. In that case end the subsidy and certify states meeting housing benchmarks, may that would work.",[deleted],2022-08-28T00:51:13,1
They did something similar with the drinking age. They also have had  unfunded mandates previously.  They issue here is that there are not the votes for this and it looks more like extortion when they can’t tie issues together.,cincyblog,2022-08-28T13:59:34,1
