"On a broader level, confirmation is not meant to be about agreeing with candidates on everything - but about vetting to see if they would be viable, competent, and fit for the job.  (And I say this as a Floridian and a Democrat who finds Rubio to be the most spineless excuse for someone who loves to claim he's on moral high ground) By that measure, Rubio isn't a particularly controversial pick. He's been in the Senate for 14 years, and in the Florida House before that. He's sat as both [Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee and as a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs.](https://www.congress.gov/member/marco-rubio/R000595)  On a political level, you have to choose your battles - while sure maybe it didn't have to be unanimous, politicians need to face the reality of the situation on how many nominations they can realistically fight and how many they can even oppose if they pass. And in this case, Democrats likely feel they need to conserve their political capital to fight what they see as the most egregious nominations of unqualified and/or radical nominations. Rubio is neither of those - again, saying that as someone who really dislikes him (even moreso now seeing what his spinelessness is leading him to advocate for (including on closing refugee admissions - by which his own family arrived to this country - and on the admin's opposition to birthright citizenship - by which he himself is a citizen of the United States since neither of his parents were citizens yet when he was born)",PhiloPhocion,2025-02-08T01:13:42,5
"Here's a MoveOn pledge to only buy necessities until Trump stops violating the Constitution and disregarding the Judiciary, among other offenses. You don't have to sign with your real name if you don't want to in case of retaliation. Just pledge not to participate in the U.S. economy until things change.

I'll also say that Rubio has been very outspoken against Russia and Putin. It's at least something,Fabulous_taint,2025-02-08T20:28:43,1
