"He just watched Escape From Alcatraz didn't he. He watched the movie and thought to himself, why don't we make movies like this anymore? Then he came up with his tariff idea on foreign films and reopening Alcatraz at the same time.",the_mooseman,2025-05-05T04:48:39,48
I know a guy who committed 34 felonies and numerous sexual assaults who should definitely be sent there,accidentsneverhappen,2025-05-05T04:45:32,38
I wonder how long before he decides to reopen Shawshank State Prison...,dmullaney,2025-05-05T04:46:19,17
I hope that means a room is reserved for him,Cyanopicacooki,2025-05-05T04:22:04,12
I would guess that the cost to renovate and retrofit the facility would be more expensive than building a new facility in one of the flyover states.,TSAOutreachTeam,2025-05-05T05:08:05,11
"This is just so emblematic of his utter lack of creativity.  the solution for ""too many brown immigrants""?  Build a literal, physical wall.  The solution to ""criminals""?  Reopen the scary island prison where all the mobsters went.  Practicality, effectiveness, cost... none of that matters- all he cares about is sounding like he's implemented a dramatic solution.  Alcatraz was chosen literally only because of brand recognition.",brahesTheorem,2025-05-05T05:16:20,7

Alcatraz has been a museum since 1963 and generates $60 million in revenue each year from 1.6 million tourists that visit. This order would cost billions of dollars while also negatively impacting tourism.,8to24,2025-05-05T06:32:29,3

Can we please put this guy in the newly reopened Alcatraz?,bpon89,2025-05-05T13:11:48,2
Turning Alcatraz into a functioning prison once again would likely cost more than $1 billion. The day to day cost of running it would be several times more per inmate than other facilities. Someone needs to inform DOGE of this senile old man's crazy ideas.,Alu_sine,2025-05-05T13:34:51,2
Lock him up!,Western-Corner-431,2025-05-05T05:01:00,1

Well...this will be the right place for him and his accomplices.,Quarax86,2025-05-05T05:07:48,1
He could continue to have tours but the people will get to look at inmates like they were caged animals in a zoo.,invalidpassword,2025-05-05T05:32:59,1

"Give it a month, a reporter will ask him how the plan is coming along,  Trump will claim he was just joking, call the reporter ""nasty"" and start rambling about fake news.",AlecMac2001,2025-05-05T05:53:47,1
I like it if he only sends really bad people like convicted rapists or I don’t know dumb asses with at least 30 felony convictions because those truly are the worst people.,RudeAlarm,2025-05-05T05:56:07,1
"So, his family will be staying?",Slow_Supermarket5590,2025-05-05T05:57:01,1
Alcatraz generates $60 million dollars a year in revenue. We already have Supermax prisons. Trump is an idiot.,Funky-Buddah,2025-05-05T06:04:55,1
Don't we have Mar A Lardo for that?,84thPrblm,2025-05-05T06:19:08,1
Is he reserving his suite early?,Neversetinstone,2025-05-05T06:27:37,1
"""The old ball and chain says Mar a Lago is too isolated, so I thought us having a place in SF Bay would be cool. The government will buy it and make it fancy and I'll steal it from the taxpayers, who are too ignorant to care.""",VeryImpressedPerson,2025-05-05T06:34:14,1
I think bukele is getting cold feet. Trump asked rwanda to take prisoners too.,TerribleJared,2025-05-05T06:39:30,1

Make sure that they include an “orange suite” to your liking.,tjk45268,2025-05-05T07:47:46,1
"I hope when all this is over, every one of Trump‘s mega traitors is removed from office, convicted of treason, and then they can all be sent to Alcatraz and we can have a public hanging out in the bay. Trump said we should bring back a certain kind of justice for treason, it would be fitting for every one of these asshats to eventually get the traitors justice.",Saber-Rattler-3448,2025-05-05T08:06:21,1
The real issue here is that he mentions putting “judges” in prison once again. Fuck that facist pig,LeoDeLarge,2025-05-05T08:41:32,1

America has dozens of maximum security prisons all over the country that no one has ever escaped from. Trump only wants Alcatraz because he saw the movie and because he is a comic book mentality moron.,ThrwawayCusBanned,2025-05-05T20:26:34,1
