"*From Bloomberg News reporter Josh Wingrove, Nancy Cook, Jennifer A Dlouhy, and Stephanie Lai:*  When Stephen Miller left the White House in 2021, the key adviser to Donald Trump turned in his badge with a parting quip: “I’ll see you in four years.”  Almost immediately, Miller and a cadre of loyalists set about devising a flurry of actions and orders they’d unleash if the 45th president was able to mount a comeback.  The fine print was later drawn up in a nondescript building in West Palm Beach, the nerve center of Trump's 2024 campaign and, eventually, the transition. A floor-to-ceiling likeness of Trump — bearing the words “Welcome to the Thunderdome” — covered one wall. The team repackaged some of Trump’s first-term priorities to make them more likely to become entrenched. And they were girded for legal fights they expected, if not sought — in part thanks to the work of conservative groups founded by Miller and other Trump allies after his 2020 election loss.  That preparation, described by people familiar with the process, enabled what has been a defining feature of the first 100 days of Trump’s second term: A breakneck speed that is both one of the administration’s most effective tools and most glaring vulnerabilities.  It allowed Trump to put his black Sharpie signature on a dizzying number of executive orders on everything from energy to education and diversity efforts that have overwhelmed opponents of his MAGA agenda and exploited the slow-moving nature of court challenges. Senior administration officials tout their rapidly enacted immigration policies as helping to dramatically slow illegal crossings at the US Southern border.  But the quick tempo has also sent the administration hurtling toward economic and political peril. The president’s hastily implemented and frequently revised tariff policies have sown deep uncertainty among trading partners and in financial markets. Economists say the levies have increased the odds of a US recession — a potentially devastating blow to credibility for a president who reclaimed the White House on the promise of taming price increases and delivering prosperity.

"What I don't understand is that Trump says illegal immigration and drug smuggling is down 97.99%, yet is still using fentanyl as a rationale for trade wars.",0002millertime,2025-04-28T09:49:06,1
