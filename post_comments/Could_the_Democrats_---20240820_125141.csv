The more relevant strategic failure was not adequately funding the Wisconsin Senate election in 2022 where the Democrat unexpectedly lost by only 1%.,federalist66,2024-08-20T13:36:51,12
Montana will hold. West Virginia is the obvious loss.,MrLegilimens,2024-08-20T15:21:44,2
Why do you think that loss was due to funding? I agree 1% is a slim margin but it isn’t always because of marketing,WillShakeSpear1,2024-08-20T14:34:03,3
"Tester is doing really badly in the polls - like 5% down. I don't see how he wins. And yes, the Democrats are obviously going to lose W. Virginia. This puts them on 49 seats to 51 for the Republicans, allowing Grim Reaper McConnell to block Kamala from governing properly for at least 2 years.",OpenTraveller75693,2024-08-20T16:36:52,2
"True, but you don't want to get outspent by $27 million to the point where you are taking a disproportionate amount of hits compared to your opponent.

A Kamala presidency is best served by losing Congress.   Kamala with a narrowly-Democrat Congress would be a disaster for 2026.,hgqaikop,2024-08-20T19:48:51,1
"Respectfully, 5% is not ""really bad."" And for what it's worth, [the last poll of likely voters ](https://emersoncollegepolling.com/montana-2024-poll-trump-55-harris-40/)(reflective of who will actually vote this year) had Sheehy at +2, a statistical tie.   Tester definitely has his work cut out for him but he's still very much in play. Turnout models suggest the enthusiasm gap slightly favors Democrats right now - we'll see if that changes.",HungryHungryBatman,2024-08-21T14:35:23,1
"I get it, but he was also a candidate that advocated defunding the police per the article you sent. Look, I think Johnson is a conspiracy muddled fool. But it’s not always money that makes the difference.",WillShakeSpear1,2024-08-20T15:01:58,3

"Also true, but I was approaching The question from the perspective of what national Democrats could have done and National Democrats triage the race for the reasons you note.  But partisanship and money can carry someone across the line even if they are a weak candidate sometimes.",federalist66,2024-08-20T15:36:26,2
"Won't be able to get much done with a razor thin majority. Voters might get irritated with her and her supporters might stay home from disillusionment.  If she gets a Republican Congress, the pitch to voters is simple: get me a Democrat Congress so I can deliver for you.",naughtyobama,2024-08-25T20:09:59,1
"Hey, it was only 1%. And again, I dislike Johnson, but he appeals to Badger territory",WillShakeSpear1,2024-08-20T15:39:07,3
