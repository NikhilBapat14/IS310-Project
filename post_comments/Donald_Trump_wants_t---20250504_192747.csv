"They closed it 60 years ago because it was delapidated and too expensive to maintain.  Wait, that also an apt description of Trump's brain.",mrgeekguy,2025-05-04T19:32:09,37
This sequel sucks.,ShakeyLegsMcGee,2025-05-04T19:30:57,24
"Lol. Expand? They'd need to tear the whole thing down, cart off all the debris, and build from scratch. Not to mention allll the lawsuits from tribes, historical societies, SF richies and real estate fuckers, and environmental groups. Plus, undoubtedly plenty of protests.   This is just a publicity stunt.",NotUrDaddi,2025-05-04T19:38:12,23
It's like he wishes he could go back to the 70s or 80s when he wasn't fat and old,ElPlywood,2025-05-04T19:31:26,10

My approval ratings are taking a nose dive.  I am losing my trade wars.  Judges keep handing me defeats.  Nothing that I am doing is working.  So let's talk about Alcatraz!,I405CA,2025-05-04T19:39:15,4

Oh the irony of him reopening Alcatraz only to be sentenced to prison on Alcatraz one day (we can only hope),2HDFloppyDisk,2025-05-04T19:37:02,3
Terrible batshit crazy ideas are his thing.,bigbluecrabby,2025-05-04T20:33:19,3
"Alcatraz did it's job, it taught us what was important in making an extremely secure prison for our most dangerous criminals and we built them, they are called SUPERMAX prisons.  Trump is an ignorant old man with ideas from the last century, he is sad, pathetic and uninformed.  https://youtu.be/zA55N-4VuRg?feature=shared",basketballsteven,2025-05-04T20:48:10,3
Boo this man! I’m not happy with him at all today! He’s expanding prisons And touching my anime! He’s doesn’t even know to defend the Constitution! This guy stinks!,Ok-Excuse1771,2025-05-04T20:06:25,2

"So if they are actually going to take ***existing*** violent criminals that have life without parole, or the death penalty, and have re-offended in prison, etc...this isn't the worst idea, I don't think.  But since Alcatraz was closed due to the cost of upkeep, not sure how this fits into ""saving money"".",ImSuperCriticalOfYou,2025-05-04T19:35:40,1

Government efficiency! Turn it from a tourist attraction that makes money (probably?) and build a new expensive prison on an island when prisoner escapes from prisons themselves hardly happen.,ChillyCheese,2025-05-04T21:38:40,3

Brain worm of Alcatraz?,OnePercentVisible,2025-05-04T19:50:26,8
"I'd argue that it does, but I don't think they'll actually consider it worth the cost in the end. It'd be much more cost effective to build a hellhole prison in El Salvador, or even Texas. They'll do something to say ""We're working on it"" and never go any further than that.   You don't put your worst prison where everyone can see it, you put it in the middle of nowhere.",NotUrDaddi,2025-05-04T19:51:54,4
Haha this administration doesn’t give a wet shit what things cost. “Cutting spending” is just the excuse they use to slash and burn whatever they don’t like.,AlphaNewsNetwork,2025-05-04T20:38:26,2
60/40 chance he doesn't know it's on an island,NotUrDaddi,2025-05-05T07:52:40,1
"I mean, it was closed due to the cost of upkeep. And it's been rotting for decades.  To rebuild you would have to tear everything down - in California, which probably has super-restrictive rules about that sort of stuff - then rebuild everything...on an island.  Would be crazy expensive, and this administration is all about less spending.",ImSuperCriticalOfYou,2025-05-04T19:56:22,2
There are a lot of movies about it but even if he's seen some movies he might have forgotten the fact that it's on a pretty small island.,SignificantBid2705,2025-05-05T07:59:22,1
No they're not. They're all about spending less *on things that don't align with their agenda*.,NotUrDaddi,2025-05-04T20:06:25,6
