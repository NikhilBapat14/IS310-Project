"So if you stop making pennies, you have to start making more nickels. It cost about three times as much to make a nickel as it does a penny. Who is going to pay for the increase manufacturing of those nickels .   Also all those items advertised as  $19.95 or $5.99 or $119.87 etc. are all going to be rounded up so every single item that Americans pay for are going to be more expensive. Now you might think rounding up a few cents, isn‚Äôt that much but think about that happening on every single item you buy for the rest of your life?   How many people will wind up losing their jobs because pennies will no longer be minted? From the people that mine the minerals that are no longer needed to the people that refine those minerals to the people involved in transporting the minerals to the people that are no longer needed to run the equipment that mint the pennies.Jobs will be lost. Products will cost more.   Besides, it‚Äôs not like Trump ever had to walk around with a bunch of pennies in his pockets. You would certainly think there were a lot more important things to be worried about than pennies and paper straws. But I guess when you‚Äôre not intelligent enough to tackle the big issues, you have to make up your own little victories to claim. King Donnie, the Royal Dick really has a need to have his ego stroked.      Edited for spelling.",Zen-platypus,2025-04-29T03:04:12,9

"It looks that way but discontinuing the penny isn't going to be cut and dry.  People paying with cash will still want those few cents so a standard has to be established.  Round up to the nearest nickel,  round down, or calculate prices so as to make the issue moot.
