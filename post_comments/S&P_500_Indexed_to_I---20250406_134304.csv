"Not that I think Trump is operating in good faith, or knows what he’s doing… but, it stands to reason that if he really was going to take drastic action to correct the American economy, that there would be a period of significant turmoil as the system re-orients itself. So the economic downturn itself doesn’t prove it’s not going to work.",Electronic_Taste_596,2025-04-06T19:52:54,-12
"What is he theoretically working for? He can’t tell us, you can’t… This is just breaking the system to break it.   The drastic action needed after the Biden admin (and the 40 years run up) was to tax the ultrarich and ease costs on the middle class and help the poor.   This is the opposite of all 3 of these.   It won’t lead to US manufacturing being built. That takes forever and requires tons of capital. Nobody builds in a recession. And you need guarantees that the tariff that caused you to build your factory with still be there when it’s done in 5 years.   And there’s no way to know if trump will remove them by then or by next Monday.   Uncertainty and recessions lead to no investment. This isn’t 4D chess. It’s a guy losing to himself at tic tac toe.",raustin33,2025-04-07T06:49:06,9

"Ya, I don’t disagree with any of this. My only point was that the calamity itself is not evidence of a broken plan, because that would likely result from any shock to the system. Commentators are pointing to the market reaction as evidence that the “plan” is harmful, I think it’s more nuanced than that.",Electronic_Taste_596,2025-04-07T10:50:40,1
"This is why democrats will continue to lose. The Republicans tow the line no matter what, meanwhile Democratic voters can’t even stop themselves from arguing with those whom they agree with. Republicans have no standards at all, but for Democrats no one is ever “pure” enough.",Electronic_Taste_596,2025-04-07T15:40:49,3
"I know critical thought is dead, but reading comprehension too? Why can’t people understand what I’m saying?",Electronic_Taste_596,2025-04-07T13:03:52,2
I think this is so bad that it almost has to be a broken plan.  Trump is out right destroying everything.,opturtlezerg5002,2025-04-08T04:46:27,1
"""but for Democrats no one is ever “pure” enough"".  I'm not like that, and I haven't really heard anyone like that.  ""Democratic voters can’t even stop themselves from arguing with those whom they agree with"".  The trump voters do that, and prolly a lot more to.",opturtlezerg5002,2025-04-08T04:42:37,1
