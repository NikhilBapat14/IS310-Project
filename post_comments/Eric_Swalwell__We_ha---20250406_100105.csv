He isn't off golfing. He is attending a Saudi-financed pro golf tournament being held on a property that he owns and is selling merchandise with his face on it. He is actively profiting off of the office of the presidency during a stock market crash and doing it in partnership with a foreign government.,handsoapdispenser,2025-04-06T13:34:56,16

I have republican friends(not MAGAs but centrist conservatives) who are saying the same thing. Swalwelll saying out loud what we all non Donald-worshippers are thinking. But also directed at those in Congress just rubber stamping approval to everything Donald wants no matter how outrageous.

The fact that we have more than enough people to overthrow the government says a lot and Trump should be scared.,Ipreferthedark,2025-04-06T16:32:33,11

Eric Swalwell could definitely be an option for 2028 (I'm still team Jon Osoff - but whatever).,Starman1928,2025-04-06T10:45:47,8

Shout out to the ASL interpreter for their professionalism in fingerspelling Trump's name instead of using his sign name. Clearly the man understood the assignment and was being diplomatic.  Trump has a sign name that include his hair flailing off. Any deaf person who doesn't like the man uses that as his call sign. People who like him tend to finger spell his name. I don't think the interpreter is showing political bias but he's smart enough to know that there might be people in the audience who like him and it might go viral. Smart move.,WorkingFit5413,2025-04-06T14:12:14,7

"The most frustrating part is that there are ample very good candidates for each of these rolls, both Democratic and Republican yet they NEVER seem to gain any traction.  I've said it before: I'm not a conspiracy theorist in any way but this all seems so planned. From both sides. Lately I've been getting 'good cop bad cop' vibes about the entire situation.",IncreaseOk8433,2025-04-08T09:16:49,1

"It was wildly popular amongst Democrat voters - there is a whole subreddit here for it! It was a huge blunder in my view to kill it.   Donald and MAGA was calling for the imprisonment and deaths of Democrats including the right to literally run over protestors, and yet calling them ‚Äúweird‚Äù was a bridge too far from the ‚Äúwe must take the high road‚Äù side.",DiveCat,2025-04-06T16:40:32,3
