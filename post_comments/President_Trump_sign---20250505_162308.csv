"Problem is, usually an EO can just be countered with a new EO. It can be made to be difficult but never impossible. So even though this EO was signed, it doesn't mean another president can't counter it or congress.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-05T18:07:18,187
Is there any situation where this research could be beneficial?,Hectoriu,2025-05-05T16:48:13,121
You've gotta give props to Rand Paul.  He was talking about Fauci and his Gain of Function research years ago.,BoredAtWork1976,2025-05-05T16:51:43,114
It’s crazy how they funded all this research to “prevent the next pandemic” then they were the ones who caused it.  Why don’t we just chill and not create super viruses in labs?,BadDadJokes,2025-05-05T16:35:09,51
Reminder that the Wuhan Institute of Virology is STILL DOING VIRUS RESEARCH.  This is a great move by Trump. I hope he can also pressure China somehow to shut it down.,JackNoir1115,2025-05-06T04:45:18,13
Too bad he can’t have “The Science” arrested and charged with mass murder and creating a weapon of mass destruction.,Mega_Dragonzord,2025-05-05T19:13:32,18
"This is not enough. It needs to be law, otherwise the next time a democrat gets into office (heaven forbid), it’s gonna be rescinded on day 1.",Ok-Willow-4232,2025-05-05T16:26:26,-13
So glad Trump is fixing the country just like we elected him to do. Can’t wait for Lefties to freak out about this.,BecauseTheTruthHurts,2025-05-05T18:09:39,-13
What's the worst that could happen? Not like they could unleash a pandemic or anything.,thinkingisthehardest,2025-05-06T14:19:17,1
It's the Wuhan Virus.  Stop calling it COVID.,vampirepomeranian,2025-05-06T10:33:17,-1
The bigger problem is that it was prohibited the last time too …,deadzip10,2025-05-06T02:16:24,5
It would be documented on record if a future president writes an Executive Order to renew gain Of function research.   Any EO that would do such a thing would immediately be reported by the media at all levels. ,Iamstillhere44,2025-05-05T19:11:55,21
the idea behind it is it speeds up the evolution of a virus so they can make a vaccine based on that one to deliver to people before the natural one evolves.,CalmHabit3,2025-05-05T16:59:42,299
"actually yes, but it has to be under the absolute strictness of condition. Effectively you could look at it as stopping a disaster before it naturally occurs.   Why the hell we thought that was a good idea to be doing in china is of Fauci's stupidest ideas.  Edit:  Seriously if you are going to do this research, you do it in a secure facility in the middle of nowhere with quarantine procedures for entering and exited the premises, meaning not just a temp check, like observation for several days. A bio research lab in the middle of a major populated cities in the most populated country...every scientist should laugh at the stupidity behind that.",Creski,2025-05-05T19:27:37,70
To understand Chinese bioweapons that may be used on us in the future?,cathbadh,2025-05-05T18:13:16,59
"Yes, but you don't want to order your bioweapon defenses from Temu or AliExpress.",NotThatGuyAnother1,2025-05-06T07:33:54,4
Depends if you want to bring the world to its knees and skew some elections.,UpvoteMagnet99,2025-05-05T19:10:14,3
"I know it’s not a bill, but Trump should name it the Feds Are Ultimately Ceasing Investments in Gain of Function Research.",imabetaunit,2025-05-06T02:22:32,9
Nono you see it was a (bat/pangolin/*insert random animal that the chinese seem to eat*) that must’ve developed this disease that spread to people!  ![gif](giphy|T2bDC7TBZfdJAqNCSh|downsized),Lord_Gibby,2025-05-05T17:13:27,16
Congress hasn’t done anything thus far these EO’s are just temporary. They have been a big disappointment,GenKraken,2025-05-05T16:28:41,27
"4232 is correct, it is a start and now it needs to be the law of the land!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-05-05T16:31:54,3
And the Democrats love slush funds... though it seems that the Republicans aren't far behind... and way too close.,ComputerRedneck,2025-05-06T05:40:51,3
I’m curious about literally anything you’ve seen in the last decade that makes you have any trust in the media,curlbaumann,2025-05-05T19:23:52,52
>Any EO that would do such a thing would immediately be reported by the media at all levels.   That's very optimistic,Reynarok,2025-05-05T19:26:30,33
Until it escapes and they haven’t found the treatment/cure for it.,r2k398,2025-05-05T17:55:44,-18
The reality of it just ends up being dangerous. People tried speaking out about it for a long time and it took a worldwide pandemic for us to say hey maybe we shouldnt do this. Just like bioweapon research history is full of cases where it gets out and people suffer. Lyme disease anyone?,Jugo49,2025-05-05T18:47:53,-6
"Or you could just, you know, not do it at all.",Jonathan-Strang3,2025-05-05T20:39:11,1
I don't trust legacy media. Right now independent online media sources have been far more accurate in their reporting than anything else.,Iamstillhere44,2025-05-05T19:59:24,9
>That's ~~very optimistic~~ **bordering on delusional**  Fixed it for ya,Original_Lord_Turtle,2025-05-05T20:56:34,22
I don't know why you're getting downvoted. That's exactly what happened.  Why wait for evolution to create a deadly virus when you can just create one in a lab and release it yourself?,JoeWinchester99,2025-05-05T20:02:50,35
"Here's the thing, I also agree, but the reality is sometimes you have to do this research because the reality is it could happen.  Nuclear weapons are awful, but they exist and we have to research ways to survive them.  Pandemics and bioweapons are awful, but we have to research how to survive those too.",Creski,2025-05-07T19:36:22,2
That is why they want to end social media freedoms. Ironically rightwing states that are still in the neocon era are assisting in this.,kaytin911,2025-05-06T01:45:13,3
the ccp apparently pays really close attention to this sub,rdrckcrous,2025-05-05T20:28:47,27
