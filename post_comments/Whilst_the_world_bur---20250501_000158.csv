"That subreddit has plenty of people who disagree about macroeconomics, regulation, and public health - but they are united in their hatred of protesters, activists, immigrants, and anyone who shows solidarity with any or all of the above.    The *glee* you find there anytime some new out-group gets arrested or deported or disappeared, it's vile.  I stopped bothering to check in once the J6 pardons went through - any group that can, collectively, excuse that kind of lawlessness (while still being cool with today's protesters getting arrested), and not see those pardons as a clear signal of an impending criminal presidency, is unsalveagable.  At best it's a useful place to see what direction a political story is going and what specific talking points are getting traction.",Mr_Shakes,2025-05-01T04:51:48,20
