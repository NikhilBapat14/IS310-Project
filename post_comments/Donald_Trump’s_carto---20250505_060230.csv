"He’s simply a clown. A bully. A thug. A troglodyte with a IQ of 80, destroying our country for retribution and personal gain.   The history books will reflect that he is, and will always be the worst president in the history of this country.",Jamizon1,2025-05-05T09:36:36,7
"It's a mess, for sure. His decisions have been all over the place and it's making things unpredictable. Stability seems like a distant dream right now.",SunKissedLadie,2025-05-05T07:02:42,4

"Do Conservatives realize how we look outside of our borders? I get that they won’t/don’t care even if they do know. But I honestly don’t know if this has even pierced their bubble.   The only major media agencies **globally** that are not savaging us, is Russia and Belarus and then the sketchiest of right wing rags.",TheDebateMatters,2025-05-05T10:27:16,2
"Why have we been cursed with this hex of a person? This is all against our will for a lot of us. I know it could be worse. I could be living in a shack in a poor village with lions terrorizing the villagers, picking us off one by one at night. Constant fear, anxiety, uncertainty and barely surviving. There are definitely some parallels here though.",Even_Establishment95,2025-05-05T10:15:45,1
"Man, they needed to get to the ports and get the 411 there to add to this.",Dangerousrhymes,2025-05-05T11:10:25,1
"We voted for 4 more years of this. Reap what we sow america. Don't point the finger at Biden or the DNC or anything. The voters were stupid, still are. I don't think anything has changed with the American voter since the time of Bush. Obama gave me hope that the united States was finally on the right track of history. So naive of me. The damage was done. Voters blaming anything else but themselves are ignorant people blaming the messenger why they weren't able to convince them to vote b over a.",aaclavijo,2025-05-05T16:26:51,1

"Blame for this falls squarely on the shoulders of Harris.  America would have been in great shape had she gotten herself elected.  All she had to do was excite us more, and be less milquetoast.  She was infinitely better than Trump, on every level. But she failed to earn our vote.  I hope the DNC learned their lesson.",insuproble,2025-05-05T10:39:52,-6
Trump is unstable chaos personified.,zsreport,2025-05-05T06:11:38,11

"It's like watching a train approaching a fallen bridge from 25 miles away, and everyone is dancing onboard including the engineers.",sleeplessinreno,2025-05-05T09:20:52,6
"Every single voter in 2024 had lived through Trump's first term. That alone, and the manner it ended, should have been evidence enough not to vote for him again. His chaos makes his lie more transparent than the fact checking he detests. Yet people seem to have forgotten he lies four times more than everyone’s stereotype of a politician, and forgotten the chaos to vote for him again in spite of options in the primaries and the general election. Voters bear responsibility for this.",woodworkerdan,2025-05-05T13:25:15,2
"Just to clear this up, was the lesson of running women candidates when America wasn’t ready for it?",VanbyRiveronbucket,2025-05-05T12:23:54,1
Hard to believe those high egg prices decided that fate of this world and look where we are today.   I think mostly everyone would be happy paying $25+ dozen to recast their vote and return pre Trump inauguration.,rubyredhead19,2025-05-05T13:58:33,1
It certainly is perplexing to think so many adults voted thinking of such an immediate issue - that is usually too minor to be under the purview of the Executive Branch of the federal government - should be the deciding factor. Perhaps we will see a generation of people who learn from this lesson - that votes have consequences beyond single issues - but it seems unlikely.,woodworkerdan,2025-05-05T14:06:49,1
