"[US special envoy Steve Witkoff warned](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/09/politics/witkoff-iran-talks-warning?utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit) that if Sunday’s talks with Iran are not productive, “then they won’t continue and we’ll have to take a different route.”  In an interview with Breitbart posted Friday, Witkoff said the US opted against holding another round of talks last week “because we needed to get to certain understandings with” Iran in order for discussions to be useful.  “Hopefully this Sunday they will be productive. Hopefully that means they will continue those talks,” he said.  The talks in Oman on Sunday will only be high-level, suggesting that the two sides would discuss a broader framework for moving forward. A source familiar told CNN that the technical team, which negotiates on more granular aspects of a deal like sanctions relief, is not expected to attend.  “It was appropriate to have the next round of talks at the principals level,” the source said.  Another source familiar said the discussions are expected to be both direct and indirect.  In the interview with Breitbart, Witkoff described the US expectations for the talks in some of the greatest detail to date.",cnn,2025-05-09T15:39:24,1
"I think the media must live in some alternate universe, Of course they will keep developing nuclear weapons!  At this point Canada and Greenland are probably doing the same.  No talks about anything between the US and almost any country will be productive going forward since the US can no longer be trusted.",literallytwisted,2025-05-09T16:36:42,1
