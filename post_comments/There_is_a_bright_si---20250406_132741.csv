Same thing with Blue states, you'll never see a Republican senator from Delaware or a Republican Governor of Hawaii ever again in your lifetimes.

Yes, about 41% of Americans believe the idiot, but that leaves 59% who can stand up and protect the idea that we can work towards a better future. That education and intelligence is part of creating a better country, and that we all deserve the same basic rights. If this country is going to fall it would have to be to a better person than this bloated idiot whose disdain for the ideals of this country and our laws is unforgivable.",woodwog,2025-04-07T10:34:32,1
The Wisconsin supreme court race was *extremely* important because it solidified the Democratic majority of the court ahead of the midterms in a swing state.  I‚Äôm not sure what you mean by distancing from 2024.,avalve,2025-04-06T17:58:05,2
"I been day drinking again‚Ä¶ (kidding, sort of, just cracked a beer). I am agreeing with you. I don‚Äôt have confidence in free and fair future elections, and I am not confident there will be elections at all. I believe (again my magic 8 ball is in the shop, with my waffle iron) through various means we will enter an armed conflict that will be a serious one, we will be under martial law, and Trump will declare some ‚Äúwartime presidency‚Äù shit to cancel them.   If not, I believe 2024 was screwed with (I don‚Äôt have the pretty convincing link, but it‚Äôs easy to find) and so will 2026‚Ä¶ then it‚Äôs basically over.

"Trump can't do that. Article I, Section 4, Clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution states that each state's legislature determines the times, places, and manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives, but Congress can make or alter those regulations, except as to the places of choosing Senators.

"Yes, indeed. So many benefits from the ""woke liberal education"" are now demonized by the right. A stronger sense of self, society, humanity, all the critical thinking skills, hard and soft, innovation, integration of the foundational subjects.  It all turns to ash in their mouths, sold to the devil just to ""own the libs.""",SuzieMusecast,2025-04-06T23:37:15,9

They're smart at what they do, but have zero curiosity about the world around them unless acquiring that knowledge is absolutely necessary for them to do their jobs.",Shirley-Eugest,2025-04-07T10:09:50,3
At least the loudest seem to be on trumps side. But maybe with the new situation of the tariffs and bis social economic changes they might reconsider and the ‚Äûsilent majority‚Äú might wake up and take over. I think it‚Äôs still untested.

"States. States are responsible for their elections. Here's a quote from an election expert. ""The president has no authority over the way in which we run our elections,"" said Joshua Douglas, an election law expert at the University of Kentucky. Instead, elections are run by the states. ""We don't really have one presidential election,"" Douglas said. ""We basically have 51 presidential elections that all occur at the same time."" States can't cancel their elections unilaterally either; they have a constitutional obligation to cast electoral votes for president every four years, and the date of the election is legally set by Congress.",xxx3reaking3adxxx,2025-04-07T19:09:56,1

If we are beeing honest it was never up for a debate. But we see that in all countries all over the world. ~30% of the people outweigh the ~70% normal and rules following people. This whole ‚Äûnot beat below the belt‚Äú is no longer working anymore. We need to take of the gloves and also start with our own families and work on our inner circle. Most of these people take themselves too serious and think they accomplished something ‚Äûgreat‚Äú. From this thinking the see themselves as superior and start to act out. A lot of well educated people can connect the dots and see that there are no easy solutions right now. I appreciate obamas message today. We need to do more and it will hurt is more but there is no way around it. MAGA thinks they can go an easier route and only care about themselves.
