"There is no formal, official definition of indigenous, although individual countries or jurisdictions might have them.  [However, here is a very common definition from the United Nations.](https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/5session_factsheet1.pdf)  >Considering the diversity of indigenous peoples, an official definition of “indigenous” has not been adopted by any UN-system body. Instead the system has developed a modern understanding of this term based on the following   >   >•  Self- identification as indigenous peoples at the individual level and accepted by the community as their member.     >   >•  Historical continuity with pre-colonial  and/or pre-settler societies    >   >•  Strong link to territories and surrounding natural resources    >   >•  Distinct social, economic or political systems    >   >•  Distinct language, culture and beliefs    >   >•  Form non-dominant groups of society     >   >•  Resolve to maintain and reproduce their ancestral environments and systems as distinctive peoples and communities.   There are two main points here that prevent everyone (or no one) from being considered. A group has to largely self-identify as indigenous and form a non-dominant group within a given society.  So Greeks are not indigenous, despite meeting most of these criteria, since they 1)Don't identify as indigenous and 2)Are the dominant group in Greece.   This also means a group could be indigenous and one point in history and cease to be indigenous when their political situation changes.",loselyconscious,2022-08-08T00:05:28,2
"Yes, you are indigenous to Greece. Whites are indigenous to Europe and Northwest Asia.",discreetlog,2022-08-08T23:11:01,0
"It would *technically* be correct to refer to yourself as an ""indigenous"" Greek.  But it's one of those words that only carries information *in contrast* to something else.  Just as ""sighted people"" are only mentioned in contrast to blind people, ""indigenous people"" are only mentioned in contrast to descendants of (European) colonists.  If a country is populated by the same ethnic group that's *always* lived there, there's no need for the term.",NerdyLumberjack04,2022-08-08T19:25:39,1
Its all about context. Its traditionally used in the context of peoples indigenous to a land they no longer control usually lost to a non-native colonizing peoples.,Shakezula84,2022-08-08T21:41:23,1
"Indigenaity isn't a hard and fast concept that you can apply a formula to and figure out yea or nay on.  It's a totality of the history and experiences of different groups of people within a certain geographical and/or historical context.  ""All or nothing"" is painting with a brush so broad you can't see either end from the handle.",HeloRising,2022-08-11T03:55:30,1
"I will add that a power inequality needs to exist here as well. For instance, both ethnic Finns are members of the Sami people are ""originally from"" Finland, but the Sami people were brought into the finish state non-consensually and lack power relative to ethnic Finns.   You could also take the Israel-Palestine context. Both Jews and Palestinians are ""originally from"" that region, but only Palestinians lack sovereignty and are subject to an external power.",loselyconscious,2022-08-08T23:05:43,1
