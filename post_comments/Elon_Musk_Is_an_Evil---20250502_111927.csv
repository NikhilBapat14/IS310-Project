Yeah and just yesterday a gaggle of teenage boys tried to convince me that he is the smartest person in the world simply because he is rich. They literally believe he designs and builds rockets and electric cars himself. One of their mothers is literally an engineer for SpaceX but her kid believes Musk is the one that actually does the work.  I don’t get it.,pomonamike,2025-05-02T11:40:03,804

"One thing he is absolutely fucking incompetent at is knowing the difference between your ego and your brand. I’ve been in branding for a long time.

Either way, it’s an invisible line in the social contract. When you cross that line - say by doing a Nazi salute in front of the entire world - the brand reputation simply collapses.

"Bit of a (tiny) gripe here, but it's not just the right either. It's the country. We live in a country where capitalist pursuit is enshrined like it's the Eightfold Path. I mean, I have to stop myself sometimes and shake an errant thought loose. and I'm pretty damned educated (For instance - you run into some miserable bastard that ruins your day, and you think, 'Eh screw em; I'm successful, well-off, I probably make more money than they do; why should I give a shit what they think?"" That is the wrong thing to think! The conclusion is solid (you shouldn't give a shit what they think), but the foundation is soooo wrong.)  It is ingrained and insidious, and absolutely affects every one of us in myriad subtle ways so much so that we have to consciously acknowledge and refute it. We are attacked from every angle by the implication that richer = better. Some of us are just better equipped (read: educated) to handle that assault. But it's always there, hammering at the gates.

"> Also, did you agree with the firing of the un-va-ccinated during the C0VID19 days?  Not OP but yes, of course. Refusing a vaccine for unhinged ""reasons"" puts everyone at risk. Also, why did you spell it that way?  Not evil, just incredibly short-sighted and probably unethical. It didn't save any money, didn't identify any fraud, and likely just protected Elon from investigations into his shady business practices.",SwarlsBarkley,2025-05-02T13:22:04,5
