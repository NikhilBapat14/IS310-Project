Ask him if he remembers what the oath of office he took says.,BukkitCrab,2025-05-04T20:03:17,48
If that isn’t impeachable then what is?,jimmygee2,2025-05-04T20:10:34,30
">”I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.”  Pretty unambiguous, I’d say. If he doesn’t know whether or not he’s supposed to uphold the Constitution, maybe he’s unfit for the job.",throwawaylol666666,2025-05-04T20:19:38,24
"If a president shrugs off the Constitution like it’s optional? That’s a full-blown crisis. He swears an oath to preserve, protect, and defend it, no “I don’t know” about it. If he refuses, Congress can impeach, courts can block, and the people can vote him out. Hell, even the 25th Amendment is there for a reason. But none of it works unless we raise hell and hold the line. Silence = surrender.",stein63,2025-05-04T21:46:56,15

"I assume it was REpublicans who kept shooting down the need for more immigration judges, and money for the border. We know judges and lawyers have already been threatened and harassed.  Then he goes off and says there are millions who would have to had cases heard and that he was elected to throw them out.  Wasn't he also elected to lower prices, then enacts a 10 percent surcharge on all goods coming into the country?  And then saying he doesn't know if he has to uphold the Constitution?",Biodiversity1001,2025-05-04T20:52:07,2

I know this disqualifies him for the office.   Unfortunately the house and senate appear to have lost their copies of the constitution. ,appleandorangutan,2025-05-04T22:32:10,1

Now we know why he didn’t put his hand on the Bible.   He thinks that’s a cheat code for breaking an oath he thinks he didn’t officially make.   Like crossing your fingers behind his back.,mjc4y,2025-05-05T09:17:18,1
