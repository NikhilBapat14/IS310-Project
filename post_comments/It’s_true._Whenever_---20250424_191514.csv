Why do people take an instant dislike to MAGA hat wearers?   It saves time.,eggybread70,2025-04-25T03:51:14,7
"Yep, I'm stuck in a red state, and I see it all the time. My teammate has an all red outfit, complete with red hat, that she loves to death. It's an outfit that features her favorite band. She said that they (red hatters) have ruined her favorite outfit because she kept being mistaken for them.  I have a red Duel Masters hat that I got at regionals back in 2005, and I refuse to wear it because of them.",Southern_Gator,2025-04-25T08:13:17,2
