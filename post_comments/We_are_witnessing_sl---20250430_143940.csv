"And it began the same way. The Republic defeated utterly all of its peers in Macedon, Asia Minor and Carthage. Became wealthy beyond all belief; the mines of former Carthaginian Spain provided more silver in months than Rome had in years, Greece and Asia Minor were absurdly wealthy. All of this concentrated wealth went to the patrician class, not even the Senatorial class but the select few families that were the most powerful, permanently entrenching them.  Then came the non stop wars oversees, the small time farmers losing their land to debt since they had to spend years fighting overseas in Spain, Africa, etc. Then came the Grachii brothers attempted reforms and the breakdown of goodwill governance along with normalization of political violence.   Then came literal foreign bribery in the form of the Jurgunthine Wars where a foreign king bribed Roman politicians to get favorable treatment during inheritance/conquering disputes.  Then came the Sulla vs Marian civil wars, which led to the proscriptions, which was the illegal seizure and murder of anyone suspected to be a Marian sympathizer (a purge Julius Caesar just barely survived).  Then comes the climax of the story, Julius Caesar and his war against the Pompeiians and eventual victory before his murder.   Then comes the finale, Augustus defeats Antony and Cleopatra and becomes the first Roman Emperor, though he never called himself that. By now the Senate had been functionally useless for decades, only briefly resuscitated by Caesar.    This all happens over about 150 years from the salting of Carthage to Augustus’ victory",underhunter,2025-04-30T21:33:54,12
