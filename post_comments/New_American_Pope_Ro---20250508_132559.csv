"He looks happy! Touches my heart. I worship as one of the religious misfits that clings to what we all want, I think, peace, so my some peace be with us that we have an American for the first time to, I hope, be able to speak to what is true and good that don't all human beings hope for? At the very least, to be better than liars covering up cruelty  I read he is warm for welcoming newcomers, which is how I consider new immigrants. All the others living here belong here, I do not understand religions that don't follow. the Bible and claim they do, where we are to welcome as our own anyone who comes to our ""coasts,"" KJV.  I'm probably just childishly excited that something has happened that might upset the rotten apple cart and show the fakery in all its smelly lies. If only we can leave each other alone to seek God personally and let others be and help where we can with real things, like food, ""good morning,"" stuff like that! . That and something less than this idolatry of human beings. I mean, we are all pretty much alike but we have different backgrounds and yes, some of us are pretty horrible but most of us I believe are willing to work for just living daily.",zephyrgal7,2025-05-08T13:41:00,16

"Eh... Not to piss on everyone's parade but he's more conservative than Pope Francis on some pretty big issues. In the past, he's really gone in on the idea that kids are being ""Indoctrinated"" into being LGBTQ.  I think that,  at the end of the day, it's not a win for any single political end of the spectrum. There's a lot of things he believes strongly in, and openly criticizes Trump for that's going to piss off MAGA and Republicans.       But I don't see how a guy who views depictions of LGBTQ and their acceptance as ""sympathy for belief and practices that contradict the gospel"" and who has argued that Francis's criticisms and push for inclusion in the Church should be based on the cultural norms of each individual country country as a win. This is a man who cited Bishops from Africa who argued that they couldn't accept LGBTQ people because homosexuality is a capital offense in their countries.",Subliminal_Kiddo,2025-05-08T14:23:56,6

"The Catholic position is that one can be gay and, separately, sex must be used for procreation and of bonding men and women. Being gay is therefore not inherently sinful.  Ultimately it's a terrible and ultimately indefensible position that functionally denies sexual expression to gay people in the same way sex with birth control also demands that sex have an opportunity for procreation (and puts the targets of Catholic missions at risk vis-a-vis the HIV epidemic), but you're mischaracterizing the Church's position for one reason or another.  Sources:  USCCB: [Catechism of the Catholic Church](https://www.usccb.org/sites/default/files/flipbooks/catechism/568/), Chastity and Homosexuality.  USCCB: [Pope clarifies remarks about homosexuality and sin](https://www.usccb.org/news/2023/pope-clarifies-remarks-about-homosexuality-and-sin):   *""As you can see, I was repeating something in general. I should have said, '****It is a sin, as is any sexual act outside of marriage****,'"" he wrote. ""This is to speak of 'the matter' of sin, but we know well that Catholic morality not only takes into consideration the matter, but also evaluates freedom and intention; and this, for every kind of sin.""*  (He would go on to explain that being gay isn't a crime, suggesting support for gay rights; sin isn't necessarily crime, nor is crime sin)  Again, the position is ultimately indefensible, particularly to people who are not Catholics, however if one is to speak as a Catholic or from a Catholic perspective as a pretense, it's critical to at least give some like, say, *The Heavenly Father* his due by following his advice when interpreting what is and to what degree is a sin, for example by considering the entire context for the alleged sin (which can ultimately be subject to Reconciliation).",CitySeekerTron,2025-05-08T16:00:42,1
