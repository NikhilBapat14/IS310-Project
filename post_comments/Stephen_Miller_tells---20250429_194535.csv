Fox News is an oxymoron. Stephen Miller is an actual moron.,Troubled202,2025-04-29T19:51:59,65
"‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to make things weird for you, John,‚Äù Miller responded. ‚ÄúBut it is our opinion that Fox News needs to fire its pollster. And I won‚Äôt surprise you with that ‚Ä¶ but the Fox News pollster has always been wrong about President Trump.‚Äù  Miller added that the White House ‚Äúdoes not acknowledge any of that polling‚Äù from Fox.  So you want fire people who collected the information that you don't like? üòÇ Fire the voters, then. The voters hate you.   https://jobs.community.kaplan.com/career/pollster",kupomu27,2025-04-29T19:54:10,24

"I am so sick of the damb double standard. If a democratic white house official or whatever miller is, said such a thing there would be wall to wall coverage about¬†autocratic liberals telling news to fire their pollsters. So so sick of this bs",Bluwudawg,2025-04-29T21:36:58,4

"When across the board polls say something, of course the trump administration would just pretend they are wrong. Honestly they are as out of touch with reality as their supporters.   Dent reality in the face of criticism, that is the MAGA way.",KazeNilrem,2025-04-29T22:55:09,1

It goes to show that you can suck up all you want; you are still a target. MAGA is just as much on the chopping block as anyone else.,brain_overclocked,2025-04-29T20:22:20,4
Lol what about the times the pollster had favorable info on Trump according to Fox? Was that wrong too? I need to take break from the stupidity of the daily newscycle. It's starting to make me irrationally (?) angry,lion_vs_tuna,2025-04-29T21:39:49,2
