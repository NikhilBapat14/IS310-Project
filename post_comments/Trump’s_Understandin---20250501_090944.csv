Trumps understanding of EVERYTHING is like a toddler.,Im_just_saying,2025-05-01T09:14:11,105
"He is a toddler. He himself has said he has the same temperament now as he did when he was in first grade. He has said his main strategy is to ""whine until I get what I want."" He has said these things publicly. Openly. Reapeatedly. He has said them in person, in written interviews, in televised interviews, on Twitter.  That so many fucking adults in this world continue to be surprised at how fucking dumb this guy is is something I cannot fathom.   Donald Trump has not lied about this. He has told everyone exactly who he is, he has explained exactly. how dumb he is, and he has explained in great detail the stupid, horrible shit he intends to do, and despite *all* that we still have all these credulous, stunned schmucks who can't understand what they're seeing.",StoppableHulk,2025-05-01T09:19:23,36
"Well yes. Due to senility and dementia, he has the mental age of, you guessed it, a toddler, and the understanding to match.",Harmless_Drone,2025-05-01T09:11:56,22
"His pathological narcissism just cannot comprehend that something can be good for two separate parties (e.g. trade), as there always has to be a ""winner:"" absolute toddler, and even they can at least be taught to share.",Groot746,2025-05-01T09:17:55,17

"100% serious: That's not fair to toddlers.   I legitimately think toddlers would have better economic policy than this. At least toddlers say stuff like ""Just give homeless food and a house.""",Odd_Jelly_1390,2025-05-01T11:25:11,3

Charlie Sykes radio show from the early 2000s is a huge reason why we have Trump! His bloviating trained his listeners to not listen to common sense and helped his listeners get addicted to political anger. Thanks Charlie!,jerrrrrrrrrrrrry,2025-05-01T10:10:59,1
"A 2 dimensional world view. I mean, Jensen Huang announced the building of operations here in the states with Trump beside him. That’s all Trump wants, an announcement. He’ll bring that up in every interview forEVER whether NVIDIA breaks ground or not in the next 5 years. Trump is all performative because he’s too lazy to do any work.",janzeera,2025-05-01T12:49:04,1
He shits his pants like a toddler too.,cmfia13,2025-05-01T13:14:50,1
"No, he’s worse. A toddler would be non functional and just sign off on stuff at random. It requires a certain level of targeted, willful incompetence to destroy the American economy this quickly. Even a golden retriever as president would at least maintain good will with our allies.",222Czar,2025-05-01T13:17:15,1
"He is a toddler, have you seen how he makes a fist?",Jarringly,2025-05-01T13:26:41,1
I'm pretty sure my 3 year old has a better understanding of the economy than Trump.,captaincanada84,2025-05-01T13:50:35,1
I don’t know…my 68 year old Dad thinks he’s just crushing it. As we are literally being crushed.,bob-knights-chair91,2025-05-01T15:23:50,1
Factories will not be built or reopened over night. Everyone maggot out there doesn’t understand that and dump is making it sound like factories will be opened when he’s ready,joystick-fingers,2025-05-01T18:35:35,1

"Did they maybe mean ""like a toddler**'s**""?  I don't think comparing a level of understanding to a young human makes much sense.",DiarrheaMonkey-,2025-05-01T11:51:21,0
Most underrated comment,SmugSchoolmaster,2025-05-01T11:16:59,2
I hate seeing these comments cuz it takes away from the fact it’s just pure narcissism and entitlement. And it disrespects the actual dementia and senile people who were decent humans,Defelj,2025-05-01T09:22:03,16
"My nephew understands sharing better than this dude.  Developmentally, my nephew is a Sociopath (as most children under 7 are) and he’s able to understand the concept of playing with a toy TOGETHER, and games with no clear winner.  Comparing Donald to a toddler is insulting to toddlers.  He understands things like exactly what he is, a shitty little Brat that made it into his 30s before hearing the word “no.”  I’d take a toddler over that any day.",aradraugfea,2025-05-01T10:30:25,7
"It's all of it.  Malignant narcissism, delusional self-image, body dysphoria, senility, syphilis, decades of cocaine & adderall abuse, all on top of the learning disabilities.",Caraes_Naur,2025-05-01T09:35:50,10
