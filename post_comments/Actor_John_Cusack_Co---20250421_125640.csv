"Bad take aside, it's always funny to me seeing this rhetoric (even some Christians do it for some reason) of ""blaming"" the people responsible for Christ's death. Like...do you understand what happens if He doesn't die? That would mean He isn't Christ.  Same thing for people that are ""pre-tribulation rapture"" that care about geopolitical alignments.

"He’s a socialist, as in the actual kind - he’s a member of the Democratic Socialists of America.  And you just got to love how they shove the word “democratic” in there just to make it taste a little bit less, genocide, death, murder, kill ~ish that comes with any socialism.",cliffotn,2025-04-21T13:50:29,6
"Ah yes because Pilate was the democratically-elected leader of the Roman colony at the time. /s  And Jesus was remarkably popular among the subjugated Jews. So any rabbis in cahoots with the Romans could be best compared to pedophile Hollywood/MSM/DNC ruling class.   In any case, sick of people using the life of Christ, a story that means so much to so many, to make some bogus political messaging.",slagathor_zimblebob,2025-04-21T14:35:48,75
If Cusack wants to bring up Rome someone should remind him that ancient Roman culture considered actors to be at the same level as prostitutes.,GlitteringFutures,2025-04-21T17:56:33,17
"It's a shame they never made a sequel for it. I think War, Inc was supposed to be considered one though.",JustinCayce,2025-04-21T18:37:59,1
"I really used to like Cusack movies a lot. But the last 10-15 years he has showed himself to be a jerk… I can still appreciate the movies, but he’s now compartmentalized for me as: a jerk who used to make decent movies. And more and more actors seem to be falling into that category these days.",Szorja,2025-04-21T18:48:16,3
"Pilate (who was the Roman governor of province of Judaea) was kind of in a bind though. Jesus was very critical of the powerful Pharisees (Jewish religious party that flourished in Palestine at the time) and threatened their power. There had already been many expensive (for Rome) uprisings by the Jews there, and Rome told Pilate that if there was one more uprising, Pilot and his entire family would be beheaded. So Pilate let the crowd decide Jesus' fate to avoid another uprising, and washed his hands of the whole situation.",GlitteringFutures,2025-04-21T17:52:12,10

Go dig up James Woods' Best Seller. Great movie and he's not a jerk.,JustinCayce,2025-04-22T00:05:36,1
"Historical arguments abound regarding Pilate’s role in Jesus’ crucifixion, from basically coerced by Rome and Jews to willing participant. The gospels portray him somewhat positively, I think for a number of reasons.   Prophecy surrounding the coming of the messiah is clear about his rejection so it would help to portray Christ as popularly rejected. Further, the Lamb is unjustly murdered so it would help to have Pilate basically accept Christ’s innocence but still be forced to sentence him to death. I also think early Christian Jews probably didn’t want to antagonize Rome any more than they had to, so best to present him as a man in a bind, as you mention.   But forgetting all of that, the Pharisees were quite popular in Second Temple era but, like you speculate about Pilate, they would have been under immense Roman pressure to quell any uppity Jews too, or face collective punishment. Also, Jews involved in the death of Jesus most probably associate with the Sanhedrin and the rest of the ruling political and priestly class. Pharisees to me relate to a school of early rabbinic Judaism, and I don’t think we’ll ever know how much popular support Jesus’ crucifixion got. I would like to/choose to believe it would have been fairly little, given what the writings say about his righteousness, and because he was a fellow Jew.",slagathor_zimblebob,2025-04-21T18:15:03,3
