"Well of course he does. He runs the world, after all.",sachiprecious,2025-04-29T13:37:13,56
All he has to do is ask. He doesn't want to ask.,YoungestDonkey,2025-04-29T13:55:51,32
Schrödinger's President:  He runs the world but he's also just an uwu smol bean who can't do anything.,Any_Mud6806,2025-04-29T13:38:52,25
Trump’s strength has waned considerably. He’s not the same guy as he was at 75.,ranchoparksteve,2025-04-29T13:38:20,7
"If Trump wanted it, it would happen 5 minutes later. He’s paying them for a service. But doing so would be admitting he made a mistake and that’s never happening",Initial-Toe-9512,2025-04-29T14:00:29,8
But he doesn’t want to.  Might smear his makeup to help someone.,Historical_Bend_2629,2025-04-29T13:35:59,7
The GOP is trying to flood the zone and make this story get forgotten. Dems like Van Hollen are ensuring it doesn’t.,Disc-Golf-Kid,2025-04-29T15:19:45,7
Given that he’s literally paying to have him held in prison,rorschach_bob,2025-04-29T14:30:54,6
"Why ""argues""? This is just plain fact. El Salvador is only imprisoning this guy because we are paying them to do it. This really isn't complicated.",PatchyWhiskers,2025-04-29T14:34:29,3
"He's literally paying Bukele 6 million per year   No reason he couldn't have been released from CECOT before he was moved   Unless Trump is literally the weakest president in history that he cant bend the will of the country of El Salvador who, and I cant emphasize this enough, is being paid by Trump",blues111,2025-04-29T13:50:54,7
"Im sure the Supreme Court is totally typing up a very angrily worded email, as they give Trump another three months to facilitate this",flirtmcdudes,2025-04-29T16:09:01,5
Of course he does.,ViolettaQueso,2025-04-29T15:31:39,2
"Trump claims he can twist the arm of any country by using tariffs, but somehow tiny El Salvador is beyond his abilities.",The-M0untain,2025-04-29T16:19:00,2
"No one doubts he does. The smirk on his and his surrogates everytime they say it's out of their hands and won't you think of El Salvador's sovereignty, fucking gross, and obvious.",pasterhatt,2025-04-29T17:01:55,2

"Yes he does. But that would be to break the spell, and once Trump loses just a little bit, he's going to fall the entire way.",ShoppingDismal3864,2025-04-29T16:28:13,1
"He could do it easily with a phone call. Which is precisely why he is denying the Supreme courts order, if he was doing even the most basic 'facilitating', this would be done.",LabRat_X,2025-04-29T17:12:06,1
...he very obviously does. ,brickout,2025-04-29T18:40:03,1
"That guy is *still* in El Salvador? Went on holiday for a few weeks and got a bit disconnected. Didn't the US Govt get ordered by the courts to facilitate his return? Jesus, what a shitshow.",Relevant-Farmer-5848,2025-04-29T18:46:09,1
"Trump been ordered to return  García,  Bar license  need to be on the line especially AG Bondi because that bloody Moo Is probably responsible for what happened in Oklahoma with  ice agents and US Marshall  with a American family  being terrorized",Ok_Sound9973,2025-04-29T20:50:23,1
I say they should stick to music.,boxcar17,2025-04-29T21:47:54,1
"Well based on what a recent interview with him from today, the President agrees, apparently.  He just won't.",iAMguppy,2025-04-29T23:49:41,1
"He will NEVER ask because it would be an automatic admission that everything his 'administration' has done to Abrego Garcia was not merely an 'administrative error' but, in totality, is literally criminal conduct which rises to the level of impeachable offenses (& not just of him, but Bondi, Noem & other thugs).    Besides...when has Trump EVER admitted he was wrong about ANYTHING in his life?    He never admitted that he lost the 2020 election & that 'Stop The Steal' was just his latest P. T. Barnum-type hoax/scam. Because he knew just what type of corner he's painted himself into with this. ",HansSolo69er,2025-04-30T09:31:22,1
No shit. Water is wet.,FuckRepublicans10,2025-04-29T16:34:22,0
"Of course he does. He just doesn't want to.   After Trump dissolves Congress, Van Hollen will be out of a job.    He can get a new one as Captain Obvious.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-29T18:12:23,-1
"Right? if the most powerful man in the world can't do something, then I question his description.",LostBob,2025-04-29T20:32:54,3
"Apparently you can even cold call his phone and he'll just answer with a ""who dis?""",TheGreatHornedRat,2025-04-29T14:05:13,6
It is understood that US and El Salvadoran governments have *some* sort of contract or treaty or agreement but nobody on the outside has seen it. That has to change. Release the treaty!,ReporterOther2179,2025-04-29T17:26:34,4
