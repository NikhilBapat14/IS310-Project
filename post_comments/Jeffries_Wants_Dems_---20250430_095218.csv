"I can't stand this guy. Dems absolutely should not back off this issue, as it's something they should actually stand up for. You know, a 9-0 supreme court decision, standing up for the right to due process etc. etc. and also just being morally right. Backing off of this will just continue to paint the party as do nothing cowards which is already an issue with the majority of the party.

"Friendly reminder that we have **no proof of life** for **anyone** who was sent to CECOT except for Kilmar Abrego Garcia. Remember Andry Hernandez Romero, the makeup artist? Remember the person with an autism tattoo? Remember the person with a soccer tattoo? Remember the 19-year-old who was taken by ICE even though ICE agents were overheard saying he wasn't the guy they were looking for?  **We don't know if they're dead or alive.** They have had no contact with family, friends, and lawyers. They were falsely accused of being gang members with no due process.  I guarantee you, if Hakeem Jeffries had a family member who was stuck in CECOT with no contact, you bet he'd want to take trips down there until they were brought back!! But because the people there are just random strangers to him, he doesn't care!  Also, I need to respond to this part:  >But some Democrats also worry that Abrego Garcia has become a less-than-ideal poster child for opposition to Trump’s immigration policies after it was revealed that his wife sought a protective order against him. She recently said in a statement that she acted out of caution because she had suffered domestic violence in a previous relationship.  >“This is not the right issue to talk about due process. This is not the right case. This is not the right person to be saying that we need to bring him back to the United States,” Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), one of the party’s more conservative members, told Fox News Radio.  First of all, Abrego Garcia had a judge's order from 2019 banning him from being sent to El Salvador. No matter what happened between him and his wife, he had a judge's order banning him from being sent to El Salvador. Why does the fact that he had a judge's order banning him from being sent to El Salvador not matter? Why is it okay for the trump admin to violate the judge's order banning him from being sent to El Salvador? This needs to be said over and over again! The deportation was against a judges order and so far, no one has been held accountable.  Secondly, how dare anyone use Abrego Garcia's wife as a reason he shouldn't be brought back to the US, when she has over and over again gone on camera pleading for him to be brought back!! If you care about his wife so much, listen to her words!! She says she wants him back. Their children want him back too. This is a family that's been split apart and they're begging to have their husband/father back. No one else can speak for his wife. She can speak for herself. She clearly wants him to come back, so I suggest you actually start paying attention to what she's saying.  And the last thing I want to say is that if the trump admin can get away with not bringing back Abrego Garcia and the others, they can send anyone -- yes that includes US citizens -- out of the country and not bring them back. ""Oops! It was an error! Oh well."" Don't let the trump admin get away with this.",sachiprecious,2025-04-30T10:31:08,32

"That's my point though. Dems have a tendency to solidly get behind people and paint them as being entirely innocent upstanding folks when that may or may not be the truth -- the truth is that regardless of their circumstances they deserve the presumption of innocence until proven guilty and due process. When Dems gloss over that, paint someone as being upstanding and entirely innocent, and then it comes out that that even one of these people deported/renditioned has compelling evidence of a fraction of what's alleged, that's a major disservice to everyone who falls in that class of detainees.  The best way to approach this with the least exposure is to demand that all people in the US receive constitutionally required due process because {xyz} reasons including it could be *you* next, just for showing up to a constitutionally protected protest. After all, the stance the administration is taking is that if they get you on a plane fast enough, *oops*, you're somebody else's problem the moment the wheels leave the ground and there's nothing we can do. Even if you're an American citizen.  Which is mostly to say that Dems should be covering their butts a little here in how they approach this. Even finding out that Abrego Garcia had a protection order against him from his wife can very quickly take the wind out of the sails of a movement if the leading narrative from Dems is that he's a completely upstanding person. Which is the very moment many (not all, but many) people start tuning out about the rest of these deportations.  This is also just politics 101 that all politics are local. The most effective messaging is about how something affects everyone and that's why they should care. Otherwise this is just a thing happening to ""other people"" and doesn't translate to swaying votes come election day.  tl;dr -- we agree on the merits but I'm saying the messaging could be better and Dems could be better at seeing the forest instead of focusing on the trees.",Boomshtick414,2025-04-30T15:10:49,2

"The biggest hurdle for public polling is that immigration into the US is like a game of chutes and ladders.

There are people who are here legally under asylum but have to check to check a box on forms that says they're here illegally, because that's how the form works.  If Dems wants to have a real conversation with the American people about immigration, they need to cook up some flow charts and start explaining what all these different buckets of immigration status are, how many people are in each, and which buckets are the ones being targeted by Trump.  Until then, public polling might as well as be asking people their opinion of today's weather in Burkina Faso.

"If you think the 24hr speech would actually sway anyone, you are misguided. I'm sure that was very popular in moderate liberal circles, but I doubt that it convinced conservatives, independents, or left-wingers. It was a 24 hr speech that prevented nothing. It was empty platitudes. At least Von Halen was able to change the conversation and reveal more information about the Garcia situation. People HATE empty platitudes and promises. People HATE performative behavior. It comes off as insincere.   People who are ""swayed"" by ""obama is a socialist"" or Clinton ""is pro illegal immigration"" were already firmly in the conservative camp. There are in that camp become of decades of relentless propaganda and ideological messaging from right wing media. One 24 hr speech isn't swaying anybody. Trying to cater to them is an enormous waste of time and political capital  The only thing Democrats do by making empty promises or comprising with the right, or being friendly with the right (like gretchen whitmer hugging trump) is demoralize and discourage their base of support to vote for them. That strategy will lead nowhere.  Dem are so afraid of appearing mean or uncivil. They think it will hurt their chances. But look at the other side. The conservatives have abandoned civility, norms. They are in your face and aggressive. And guess what, they have been rewarded with enormous political, legislative, and judicial success. Their strategy literally transforms the values of the United States public. 20 years ago, 30% of conservatives wouldn't have supported Donald Trump. Some of them were even pro-immigration.
