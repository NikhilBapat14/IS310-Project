Canâ€™t they just give this guy puzzles or colouring books or something to keep him occupied?,Hi_Im_Dadbot,2025-05-04T21:54:11,17
What a moron. Itâ€™s going to cost a shitload to reopen Alcatraz.,overmonk,2025-05-04T21:54:49,7
How much is that going to cost? Trump loves to waste money!,Enviro_56,2025-05-04T21:57:53,5

"Oh, look!  A new shiny thing for the dirty masses to focus on!    The dude is straight-up and intentionally ruining America to try to remake it into some New Russian-like bullshit for Musk and their billionaire tech-bro's to run like wannabe kings, and this media gets posted and reposted to keep minds from thinking about what's really going on.    Fuck Alcatraz.  The departments and agencies that protect us and keep us safe matter.  The promise to our elders that their contributions to the State would not go in vain and leave them destitute at their most vulnerable moments matters.  The continuation of our democracy, with free and fair elections, matters.  Science matters.  Law and order matter.  Facts and truth matter.  Alcatraz does not matter.",IJustLookLikeThis13,2025-05-04T22:29:33,3

"Building a new maximum security prison typically costs $200 million to $500 million, or higher depending on the facility's size, security features, and location. Alcatraz has been closed over 60 years and is already due for 50 million in maintenance alone. This is just tough on crime symbolism, that's going to the taxpayers millions.

"He does not care. The whole point of cutting all social services and peopleâ€™s retirements, is so he can fund his goofy ass pet projects that are just straight up stupid. When his gone in a couple years, he wants weird ass memorable shit to be around so people donâ€™t completely forget his lame life and lamer presidency",OldPiano6706,2025-05-05T05:43:59,3

I doubt heâ€™s going full term. Once his ideas really hit the uproar is going to be insane.,overmonk,2025-05-05T05:48:04,1
"I don't think he cares to that level. He just thinks ""island prison, that's a great idea!"" and tells his minions to do it. The cost and taking funding from other things to pay for it aren't even part of his thinking, just that he shoukd get whatever he wants.",gollumaniac,2025-05-05T10:54:53,1
"You missed my point. My point was that's the kind of money required for upkeep as a park, how much will it cost to retrofit Alcatraz to modern prison standards?",Prestigious_Net_8356,2025-05-05T00:16:43,3

"Sorry, I guess my reply was a bit terse but I was trying to make the same point and fell very short.  Sleep deprivation plus sinus infection = my IQ decreases lol  I did some reading about what it would take to restore the facility; to fortify the concrete which essentially gets consistantly eaten away by the salty environment, not to mention earthquakes, then the cost of supplying the prison/inmates (because island) and all the infrastructure work would be in the mid to high hundreds of millions, if not more.
