Classic Trump move. He always takes credit for the good and blames others for the bad. It's like he never left the campaign trail.,UniqueBabeDoll,2025-05-04T10:06:37,5
"The truly ironic thing is all he had to do was just do *nothing*, and take credit for Biden's economy, which would have kept going up and up. Everyone would have let him have his little show, and been relieved he was staying out of the way and letting the adults do their work. Give him little pats on the head, let him do his little media appearances, let the cultists have their delusion.   But no. This guy is such a fucking insecure little dipshit he feels like he *has* to do his own thing, but his own thing is always fucking stupid, because he's fucking stupid.   It's no different than what he did during COVID.   People think he has some master plan, but he just doesn't. Do you not remember COVID?   Obama put together a world-class pandemic response team. Some of the best virologists and epidemiologists around.   All Trump had to do was just let them do their job, and take all the credit for it. Just urge everyone to be calm and follow advice, and then he could be the man who saved the world from COVID.   And instead, he insisted on demonizing his *own administration*. He undermined all the expert advice because *he* wanted to be seen being the smart guy. He couldn't handle Fauci saying smart things at the podium, so he had to get up there and say the opposite.   Millions of people died because of this fat fucking fool's ego. Millions. And millions more are going to die now, and he won't even get what he wants out of it. Because he's a fucking idiot. He's just really that stupid.   There was no advantage to him doing what he did during COVID. It cost him the presidency. It wasn't a smart move. It wasn't 4D chess. People think he plays 4D chess because the things he does are so stupid they *Have* to be moves. But they're not moves. He thinks this is a good idea because he's incapable of seeing what a good idea actually is.   He doesn't make smart moves. He's a really, really fucking stupid human being. If people haven't figured that out by now, please figure that out now.",StoppableHulk,2025-05-04T10:21:45,4
"""The tariffs are going to make \*us\* rich"".  Umm... Yes,  tariffs will generate more money for the GOVERNMENT. They are only going to make US poorer. Us, the citizens, the taxpayers. The government will have more money available. More money for him to WASTE. More money for him to deFRAUD the government of. More money for him to ABUSE the system to line his pockets with.  We watched him do it his first term, he is doing it now, and he is scaling it up in every way he can. The giant orange turd is a genius, but not intellectually, he is a genius grifter and a genius manipulator. The KING of WASTE, FRAUD & ABUSE.  Biden improved the economy. Period. Dump is destroying it one step at a time. He dismantled the programs that the Biden administration put into effect, the programs that were CREATING jobs. Now not only is Dump tanking our economy, but he is systematically dismantling every protection for wildlife and wild lands, getting rid of the regulations that protect endangered species and animal habitats, regulations that ensure clean (er) air and water. How long will it be before we all have water as bad as what Flint Michigan had(/has?)?  Dump's goal is to destroy the good jobs that support our families and make us so desperate we have to work for slave wages, making his cronies even more money and making us all too tired and hungry to fight back.",SatoriFound,2025-05-04T12:15:06,4

A decade?  His whole shit stained lie of life.  I would rather have morals and dignity than live a constant babbling lie while being “rich”.  Guy is a thief at best.
