So what happens when a kid has gay parents?,rottenavocadotoast,2025-04-22T12:28:40,8
I thought it was ‚Äúleave it to the states/school board.‚Äù   I‚Äôm sure the conservatives wouldn‚Äôt legislate from the bench like they like to whine about.   The judicial restraint approach is you must pass a law in the school board or other body of government to ‚Äúopt out‚Äù of the curriculum.   But I guess we‚Äôll see.,Done327,2025-04-22T12:20:24,4
"It's not far from ""Let the parents opt out of their kids receiving information that LGBTQ people exist"" to ""Schools can never mention LGBTQ individuals at all.""   HOWEVER.  If we force these parents to accept that they have no say in what their children are exposed to, it's a VERY quick and dirty slide to ""Christians"" enforcing adherence to Christian dogma, because the precedent will have already been set.  ETA: This feels like a Red Herring. ""Don't talk about LGBTQ issues with certain kids"" feels BAD. So we're inclined to say that it's more reasonable to have a set curriculum and that's that, just like you can't opt your kid out of math class. But is someone just covering up the real plan to enforce Christian Nationalism?",Frickin_Brat,2025-04-22T13:09:04,5

"It‚Äôs a compelling argument. Of note is that it‚Äôs not just Christians, but Muslim parents also saying this is a first amendment infringement.   A Supreme Court ruling in favor of the parents would be a fantastic legal precedent for anyone who doesn‚Äôt want their child exposed and taught about Christianity in a public school.  Because that is the largest demographic of religion in our country last I checked. So it would be a wonderful blow against states that are trying to incorporate it.  If it‚Äôs a red vs blue battle, so many Reps are short sighted looking at this as a win, when it does long term damage to their stated goal of having religion in school.   I am a firm believer in inclusion, and also a firm believer of keeping these things separate. Plus it‚Äôs just asinine for a parent to think they can prevent their child from learning about LGBTQ community. So ban a book, do long term damage to the opposition and kids still have the opportunity to break free from being forced to believe in a fallacy as a code for living life. Or they can just say they believe while acting against it, like so many people do.",CrankyOM42,2025-04-22T14:02:31,1

Clearly the gay ‚Äúparents‚Äù are just groomers and then child protective services are called so the child can be relocated to a godly house hold,abraxius,2025-04-22T12:40:36,2
"Don‚Äôt worry, pretty soon that won‚Äôt be a thing when they get sent to the camps.   Can‚Äôt believe how fast this country is turning back time.   I bet they‚Äôve already started manufacturing the ‚Äúwhites only‚Äù and ‚Äúcolored‚Äù signs.",Area51_Spurs,2025-04-22T12:46:35,4

It‚Äôs already happening here in Texas in our schools. They‚Äôve approved a curriculum that includes Bible-based lessons and stories. They passed a bill to allow teachers to pray or engage in religious speech in the classroom and they passed vouchers which will take money from public schools to pay for children attending private schools and churches are already lining up with schools to grab that $$. Texas is just a testing ground before they spread it nationwide.,anita-artaud,2025-04-22T13:25:55,4

"Then if SCOTUS rules that parents can opt out of teachings on the basis of religion, I'd hope that the left will line up around the block to sue for the right to opt kids out of religious indoctrination.",Frickin_Brat,2025-04-22T13:28:35,5
