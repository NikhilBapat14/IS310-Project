Honestly I'm surprised there is even that many refineries left in cali. There will be a tipping point where car and gas producers just refuse to do business in cali even tho it's a massive market and it will hurt the vulnerable people the democrats claim to represent.,eschwifty,2025-05-01T20:34:09,1
