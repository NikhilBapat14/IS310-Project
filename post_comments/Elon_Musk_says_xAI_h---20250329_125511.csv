"Do you all understand what this means????  X will start creating more accounts that ""look like"" real people to spread more lies about Trump and other Radical Republicans.   We live in an age of 1 percent of all people are needed to sway power.  The Republican party will have a much larger drum beat than they do now. What will Democrats do to counter act this????",OtpyrcLvl1,2025-03-29T12:58:22,139

"He bought Twitter with Tesla stock, and now Tesla stock has crashed.   I honestly don't know how this figures into it but selling it to ""another company"" means the Tesla stock has no bearing anymore? I dunno but it has to be something to do with it.",ToasterOven31,2025-03-29T20:30:05,6

True. But it won't increase the number of real users on x. It doesn't matter if those fake accounts aren't influencing real people.,aninjacould,2025-03-29T18:14:12,9

The only person valuing Twitter at this price is himself though,RellenD,2025-03-29T20:07:55,3
Thats what i was wondering too,deathmetalreptar,2025-03-29T21:15:01,1
It sadly might boost the Tesla stock price.  But that all depends on whether AI investors value Musk’s leadership and democracy.  His companies have competitors. Many tech companies are investing in AI.,Good_kido78,2025-03-30T09:57:12,1
That benefit you described is true.  However that pales in comparison to the Billions of dollars of government contracts they get because he will deliver votes,OtpyrcLvl1,2025-03-31T00:12:28,1

All the fakeness and shenanigans are not going to attract legitimate investors who trust management.  This is why dictators resort to mafia states.,Good_kido78,2025-03-30T09:49:56,1
It's about swaying 1% of the population.  Most people who are on X will never know if the account is a real human or not.,OtpyrcLvl1,2025-03-31T00:10:21,1
