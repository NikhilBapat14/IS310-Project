"It first started during the roman times because a pope then had a roman name that could be tangentially related to the old roman religion and gods. After the 10th century is when it became popular since a lot of popes started appearing from other countries like France and Germany and they chose Italian sounding names or the names of Saints to be closer to their predecessors. Since then most new popes (not all, although the few that didn't funnily enough had names that a previous pope already used so they continued a line anyway) have chosen a name based on how they might wish to emulate a former popes rule with the same name. Specifically in the issues they focused on and such.",ThiccDiddler,2025-05-09T04:25:55,3
