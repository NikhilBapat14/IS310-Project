There was a time when talking about using military force to annex an ally's territory was something that would get you impeached...   I appreciate how the right wing downplays Hitler comparisons as their guy literally talks about doing just that because the territory is somehow needed for our security.,Grey_0ne,2025-05-05T13:33:47,38

"US, don't be so cruel! Stay away from Greenland! A third of all Greenlanders live in Denmark proper and several thousands of Danes live in Greenland as does a lot of people from the Faroe Islands. There are no Greenlander who does not have family in Denmark. It's a realm and has been for hundreds of years!  How would the Americans square that circle? Denmark already juggles three languages but Amerika wants to stir a fourth into the equation? Families will be split and some would have to adhere to foreign legislation and alien customs and will need visa to visit each other. None of these peoples want a forced citizenship or a flag from a foreign country! Erfalasorput is Greenland's flag!  The USA can't just convict them all to be Americans, rob all of them of their current citizenship - that is too hard a punishment for having done absolutely nothing wrong. A hostile takeover, creating adversaries in all 3 countries, the rest of Scandinavia and in the most of Europe too. This idea really is utterly outlandish, Greenland does not need any regime change!

"Just contract it out to [Milo Minderbinder](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milo_Minderbinder).  > Eventually, Minderbinder begins contracting missions for the Germans, fighting on both sides in the battle at Orvieto, and bombing his own squadron at Pianosa. At one point Minderbinder orders his fleet of aircraft to attack the American base where he lives, killing many American officers and enlisted men. He finally gets court-martialed for treason. However, as M&M Enterprises proves to be incredibly profitable, he hires an expensive lawyer who is able to convince the court that it was capitalism which made America great, and is absolved only by disclosing his enormous profit to the investigating congressional committee.",Minguseyes,2025-05-05T14:18:10,1

"Trump couldn't keep soldiers in Greenland for more than a set number of days. Without Congressional approval.  But, SCOTUS has removed the shackles of the Presidency from criminality.  As for the Troops. A certain amount of them wouldn't follow such an order and would be ""jailed"" and discharged. while other percent would follow orders.  It wouldn't really be a huge Constitutional battle.   It might actually help Trump to trim the Armed Forces of ... actual good soldiers and leaders. Allowing him to replace those that would go against him.  It's a fairly common tactic of dictators and the like.   Just do something wrong. Find the people that disagree with you. Remove those people. Fill in the areas with people that do agree with you and then your golden.",HonoredPeople,2025-05-05T13:40:47,11

"Perhaps, but perhaps that's not the point.  So, they do that. Then that high-ranking Air Force official is then punished and removed. Pretty harshly. Something, something, endangering the troops, something, something.  That, 1, makes an example of what happens when someone does that. 2, opens up a high-ranking official slot for replacement and 3, allows for the general concept of Trump's ideals.
