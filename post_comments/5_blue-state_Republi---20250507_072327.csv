"That's why going to Town Halls and yelling at them is a no-lose scenario. Best case, it causes them to do the right thing. Worst case, at least you get to scream at them.",theneumann64,2025-05-07T08:03:52,143
"And Trump would give them a phone call, and they will fold.",nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-05-07T07:26:48,109
No they are not. They just pretend to be so they look like they are acting in the best interest of their constituents.  They'll tow the party line and tell the lie that they didn't have any choice.  The only way to get any of them to do their job is to start voting them out.,PillowPrincess314,2025-05-07T07:32:46,52
“While this bill doesn’t get everything we want it’s better than nothing so I folded and voted for it”,hdiggyh,2025-05-07T07:41:09,17
"I know most folks believe these Republicans will fold but I’m taking the contrarian view.  I think they will successfully hold out as a group and get the SALT deduction added to the tax bill.  If they don’t, they will lose reelection and they know it.  Plus, let’s dispense with the notion that Trump and the Republicans care about the deficit.  Just add the SALT deduction to the tab and come up with some fancy or not so fancy way of pushing the bill through reconciliation.  They can worry about the ballooning deficit when there’s a Dem President.",pollingquestion,2025-05-07T09:44:09,10
The Hill is always faking the rosy world as if we are on the right side of the history. The result of 2024 election says otherwise. Americans want dictatorship and they love authoritarian.,Intelligent_Teach247,2025-05-07T08:14:33,9
I can’t even imagine being willing to vote on a $4.5 trillion dollar tax cut for the wealthiest Americans in exchange for getting rid of health insurance and food benefits for poor people.   These 5 folks are maybe even worse than the rest of the Republicans because their objection is that people with high home values *won’t get enough of a tax cut.* Super gross. I don’t understand why people vote for these sorts.,finallytisdone,2025-05-07T14:23:21,3
Good for them. This Salt issue was nothing more than a means to rob blue states and redistribute their money to red states. It’s all it ever was.,-Gramsci-,2025-05-07T12:35:45,2

This level of unseriousness is so irritating as to be complicit with the criminals.  Protest for real or roll over and show your belly. Stop playing games because none of this is fun or funny.,lesmainsdepigeon,2025-05-07T09:27:06,-11

It does.  Republicans are trying to jam it through using some “innovative” accounting approach.  Essentially not counting the expiring tax cuts as part of the debt going forward bc they are not new.  I assume they will find utilize additional tricks to jam through the SALT deduction.,pollingquestion,2025-05-07T12:08:59,2
"From a policy perspective there is more reason than ever. (But the overarching policy furthered is federalism).   Who do you trust to spend your hard earned tax dollars more intelligently right now? Your local government or this comic book villain iteration of the federal government?   I’ll divert as much of that money to my local government as I possibly can. To provide me with valuable goods and services. Education, police and fire services. Nice parks and programs for my family to enjoy. My local library. Business infrastructure.

"The deductibility of SALT at the federal level has no impact on the amount of state taxes that you pay. It only changes the amount you pay federally   As long as the benefits from state taxation are federally-exempt from income, then the taxes used to fund those benefits shouldn’t be deductible. That’s how we treat every other transfer in the tax code, other than SALT",Obvious_Chapter2082,2025-05-07T16:52:58,1
