"McDonald‚Äôs went from consistent cheap, familiar, and filing. To consistent expensive, familiar , but kinda ick. Maybe a bit more affordable if you like click some deals on an app, but then it‚Äôs not really what you wanted, or it‚Äôs too much.   They did this to themselves to maximize profits at the expensive of their brand. And them chickens do eventually come home to roost.",leontes,2025-05-01T07:56:28,136
"Fuck them. They used Covid as cover to raise prices, and now think they're entitled to those larger margins. (During that time, their sales decreased but they said that they were happy because the higher margins more than made up for the lower number of sales.) They've increased prices, downsized portions, and lowered quality - and now they're surprised that we don't want to buy what they're selling. A fair product at a fair price would probably work in their favor, but everyone knows that that's the last option they'll choose.  Their current pricing is just fucking insane, btw.",barneyrubbble,2025-05-01T08:04:11,107

"In 2020, businesses in America told you national supply lines were disrupted. Goods were scarce and they had to increase prices. In 2021, we saw the largest inflation rate in history. They continued saying there were long-term supply chain issues. In 2022, we saw the second highest inflation rate in history as businesses continued to increase prices. By 2023, everyone agreed COVID was over and supply chains were normal - but companies continued increasing prices beyond normal inflation rates. Prices never went down even when supply and demand was corrected.   In 2025, Trump enacts tariffs. Companies tell you they have to increase their prices to mitigate the cost of business. In 2026, they‚Äôll tell you there are long-term effects from the tariffs and they have to increase prices further. In 2027, we will all agree the tariffs are gone and over but the prices will continue increasing by design.   They are recreating a post-COVID economy to steal money from you, again. If a McDonalds combo was $9 in 2019, but it‚Äôs $13 today, it will be $18 by the end of 2028. Businesses want uncontrollable inflation and growth while they still get to pay you peanuts.",brakeled,2025-05-01T13:45:56,3

Makes sense even before the recent economic issues McDonalds was seeing consumer blowback since they massively raised prices. That was pretty dumb on their part the main reason people got their food was it was decent fast food for being dirt cheap. Now it is about the same cost to get a real meal or at the very least better quality food at most other restaurants and fast food places. Even other places that have raised prices are still more affordable for the most part. Hell Taco Bell is ranked really high for health and quality as a fast food restaurant and they're still affordable compared to McDonald's.,Arrttemisia,2025-05-01T08:32:07,2

"My go to impromptu fry extravaganza is usually penn station. A large fry is fucking ridiculous in size. That and a large coke is like 10 bucks,  which seems expensive but it's probably close to that at Mcd's anyway and it's so much better. Also I don't do it often, usually when I'm in one of those moods where I'm like ""well I could kill myself or just go eat a bunch of fries in the parking lot at work"" and I usually opt for the fries.",1950sGuy,2025-05-01T10:39:21,2

"Exactly. Got a Blackstone griddle 3 years ago, and learned how to make smash burgers. $12 spent on meat, cheese, and buns is enough to do 6 burgers. Takes me 8 minutes to cook, and clean up the griddle.",bvh2015,2025-05-01T09:50:14,10
"Burgers are ridiculously easy to do and cheap. A 15 pack of half decent (but still better than fast food) 1/3lb patties is like $20. Buns are cheap too (sometimes I just use regular bread I always have around) as are toppings. Could easily make one for less than $5 with frozen fries which come out good.  And hell, you don't even need a grill or anything fancy. Debatable if it is worse, but you can just as easily get away with cooking on the stove. Burgers are easily the one thing I try to avoid getting if I'm out and about given they're cheap and easy to do at home.",Frowny575,2025-05-01T23:28:08,1
"DoorDash used to consistently offer a free 10-piece McNuggets when you ordered a certain amount, which I usually did because I wanted to get 2-3 meals out of a delivery if I'm shelling out for it.  They changed that to ""Buy one 10-piece, get one free"" which costs ~7.50, but a 20-piece is about a dollar more so it's no longer a deal at all.  It actually killed my sometimes-habit of ordering from them, since I was only justifying it when I got free nuggets.",SidewaysFancyPrance,2025-05-01T11:33:25,2
