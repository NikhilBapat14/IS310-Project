Meanwhile conservatives were the opposite. They generally wanted severe consequences for criminal activity, meaning long sentences and additional punishments even after release (like disenfranchisement). you would expect this to apply even more strongly in this case, because it was an attack on the capitol and conservatives in the past always had a particular emphasis on supporting symbols and institutions of the state.  So all things being equal you'd generally expect the right to be harsher on the Capitol insurrectionist than the left. And yet we're seeing the opposite in practice.
