They have taken every indefensible position and are just screeching in the corner at this point wondering why the American people aren’t that into them.    A major issue is the older population watching cable TV news that is so biased and twisted.  The stunt NPR pulled recently is a great example.,Chkrg,2025-04-22T07:52:57,3

"""The real emergency is the American people are getting what they want""  Such a great line. The Democrats are literally doing everything they can to obstruct the democratically elected President that even won the oh so precious popular vote. Sit the eff down like the American people told you to. Disgraceful from the party of ""protecting democracy"".",Zaphenzo,2025-04-21T21:04:13,4

Seems like every day there’s another story about Jennings crushing some narrative.  I love it.,j3remy2007,2025-04-22T05:38:30,4
