"The blame lies with Russia.  However deserved, blaming past administrations misses the point.  Coulda, shoulda, woulda.  The US has an opportunity NOW to take a position that rejects Russian claims on Crimea and the rest of Ukraine.",Algum,2025-04-25T22:12:52,167
Blame neville chamberlain for the occupation of czechoslovakia instead of... you know... hitler?,Dutchtdk,2025-04-26T04:39:19,30
"For all the talk of Ukraine’s right to sovereignty, which it does have, and the importance of protecting democracy, none of that seemed to exist in 2014. If there is outrage over Russia occupying Crimea, then blame the people who allowed it to happen, not Trump. It’s been 11 years since Russia took control of the area and did so with minimal resistance. Moreover, Russia has been fighting a war with Ukraine, and a de facto war with NATO, for over three years. During this time, Russia has not lost enough battles to be forced to return the territory.   Is it morally wrong that the Crimean Peninsula is under Russian control? Yes, absolutely. Are Putin’s claims for why Russia should control Crimea valid? No, not at all. Should Ukraine accept Russia’s authority over Crimea? No. Should we want to live in a world where Crimea is returned to Ukraine? Yes.  However, the reality of the situation is that Russia controls it, and nothing has made them give up control of it in 11 years. So, as a realist, why, in a peace agreement for a war that Russia is winning — and most likely eventually will win unless NATO countries put boots on the ground and engage in a full-out war — would Crimea not be recognized as Russian territory?

"Exactly. If Ukraine wants Crimea back they need to win the war. Only problem is no matter how many billions in weapons and armor we give them, they are losing territory by the day. Shoveling more money into the dumpsterfire isn't the solution. Win the war or concede Crimea. That's it.",BlackScienceManTyson,2025-04-26T05:59:22,2
