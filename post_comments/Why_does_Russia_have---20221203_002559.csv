"Inequality and autocracy are not exclusive to Russia, nor was that fate pre-ordained for Russia. You might recall the most evil regimes in European history eventually yielded to peaceable democratic ones, despite the continent's long history with monarchism and despotism.  Had the Liberator not been assassinated (motivating his son and successor to the path of illiberal and authoritarian rule), had the Bolsheviks respected democratic order, had the Allied intervention in the civil war been more competent or successful, had Yeltsin not chosen Putin, had Putin not liquidated liberal opposition... these are all choices, made by actors competing against opposition who managed to succeed.  The Soviet Union was the last great extractive colonial empire, which partially explains its brutal, imperial nature. Putin's Russia is much like any autocratic rentier state, like Angola, Azerbaijan, or Saudi Arabia.",Cleomenes_of_Sparta,2022-12-03T18:14:32,3
"Basically the country was repeatedly wrecked by the Mongols in the Middle Ages.  Which led to:  - (1) A deep cultural normalization of barbarity.  Terrible things will happen to the common people and there's nothing that can be done to stop it. - (2) A centralization of power.  The only way to somewhat protect yourself from the invading horde is to have a really strong government that controls every aspect of society.  All the crappy side effects are worth the price of protection. - (3) Militarization.  Expansion is super important because the terrain around Moscow itself kinda sucks for defenders.  Having a strong military is super important and worth any sacrifice, because Mongols.  Basically Russians know things are bad, but the whole society was so deeply traumatized by the brutality and destruction of the Mongolian invasions that they just passively accept whatever their rulers want to do.  Because things being bad is just the way of the world in Russia.  ""I'm not dead or in prison, so the government must be doing something right.  Therefore I support them."" -- the average Russian on the street, probably.",white_nerdy,2022-12-09T12:35:17,3
"Russia isn’t really part of Europe, but isn’t entirely separate either, so Renaissance Humanism and the Enlightenment reached them in a very belated and bastardized form. (Isiah Berlin once wrote that the Russian people essentially went through the Enlightenment and the Romantic Revolution simultaneously, and this put Russia on a very different trajectory than Western European nations.)  Serfdom was kept in place in Russia for a much longer time than in Europe. Serfdom prevents the peasantry from becoming mobile — it’s against the law to leave the land you work. (The landowner doesn’t exactly own you, so much as he owns your labor — you can’t sell it to someone else.) New ideas do not spread easily through such a population.  Further, Russia is primarily a land power. They did not take much part in the age of Exploration and wars with the Japanese prevented them from developing a powerful navy until the mid twentieth century. Sea powers tend to be more cosmopolitan and democratic.   There’s also the argument that because Russia is such a vast territory, composed of such varied people, more autocratic forms of government were necessary to hold the nation together. I don’t agree with that assessment, but it’s definitely an argument that Russian leadership have used to legitimize their power.",pluralofjackinthebox,2022-12-03T19:27:21,1
"Russia's autocratic bent isn't particularly novel in the scope of world events.  The unique situation in Russia can probably be traced back to the fact that Russia was a feudal society that was jerked rather violently into the modern era with no real time for society to change along those lines. The Russian people were thrust into a situation they weren't prepared for and they fell back on what they knew. That's not to say that Russians are somehow stupid or inherently dictitorial but if you take any society that's been accustomed to some form of ""orthodoxy, autocracy, and nationality"" for a long time and relatively suddenly introduce radically different ideas from above there's going to be some disruption.",HeloRising,2022-12-04T13:50:38,1
"History is often contingent. Why did Russia develop a serf system at all instead of a more Western Europe-style feudalism? There's not always a ""reason"" in the sense that yes, Russia could have chosen to do different things. Stalin could have chosen not to purge. Or immediately after Stalin's death, the power struggle could have ended up differently. Could Gorbachev have chosen to continue his predecessors' decisions to compete with the US instead of the unilateral concessions he actually did choose? Of course.   *Why Nations Fail* by Acemoglu and Robinson really makes this point heavily. History is just contingent. Sometimes good outcomes happen because people make that choice...and sometimes they don't. We can look back and analyze the factors that weighed into decision making, but every pattern *could* be broken, and we've seen examples of it time and time again. There isn't some guiding hand of fate that pushes human beings in a certain consistent direction.",mormagils,2022-12-05T09:32:33,1
"Interesting question!  You can actually answer this question with some specific events in Russian history, but overall there are too many answers to list in all. One lesser examined one might be the destruction of the Russian republic, Novgorod. Novgorod was by all accounts extremely wealthy and a cultural centerpiece of medieval Russia. It could very well have become the capital of Russia in a slightly different timeline.  But, some Duke from some barren despotic state called Muscovy (Moscow) went ahead and eradicated Novgorod as a state. No more Republic!  (Disclaimer: This is a severe simplification of what happened here, but I cba to write an essay.
