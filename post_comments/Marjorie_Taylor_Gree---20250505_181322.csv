They drift from grift to grift and each one of them just sucks each other to the marrow until there's nothing left and then they move on.   They all fucking hate each other.

Empty space, loneliness, and a whole lot of fucking stolen money they can't even fucking use in any gratifying way.   NOTHING will fill these soulless and bottomless empty vessels.

"With a gun to my head, I’d take the neocon. And Around 2017-18 I was in the camp of people who thought shining light on the extremists and showing the true colors of conservatism would be the disinfectant we needed to inoculate ourselves from its potential dominance. I genuinely thought that the authoritarian masterminds would see their slow, deliberate movement toward their end goal collapse when their hidden objectives were exposed by the loud-mouth know-nothings broadcasting their true intentions to less politically engaged members of the voting public.   But all that really did was establish a permanent platform to normalize the fringes and unlock terrifying new possibilities. It also turbocharged the pipelines for recruiting and radicalizing a lot of people who were previously disinterested in politics — including a lot of groups I would have expected to be activated in a progressive direction when exposed to the right’s unfiltered vision for the country and of its perceived opponents.   Though I wouldn’t call it accountability, a neocon during their peak years would still be pressured to resign when caught up a scandal for something like infidelity, whereas a MAGA dominance means celebrating their members doing far worse and using their self-victimization as currency to further punish the actual victims and investigate the investigators.

"There’s a fundamental difference between “JD Vance got jealous over the popes lively padded sofa and killed the holy father in a lovers quarrel” and “JD Vance has a thing about fucking couches because the kind of females he prefers are so young that their face is out of his line of sight and all he sees are the cushions.”  Both the statements are hyperbolic examples of insults touching on very emotionally fraught topics. But one is clearly hyperbole ad absurdum; no, Ava ce didn’t literally kill the pope.  And the other is hyperbole that comes across as uncomfortably believable, and so causes an emotional reaction (for or against your position, it doesn’t matter which) and ultimately harms the pursuit of logical and rational discussions and solutions.    In other words: “It’s clear that MTG lacks a fundamental baseline understanding of the intricacies of properly serving in her position” is fine. It puts forth an opinion, but that opinion is supported in the statement itself by referencing the various and repeated examples of where she just does a shitty job. “MTG doesn’t actually have any thoughts; her brain was replaced by an AI engine from a secret middle eastern anti Israel alliance, but its first generation tech and full of bugs” is fine. It shares the belief that she is literally incapable of abstract thought, but does so in a hyperbolic way that is applicable but also absurd, not creating any dissonance in the position. “MTG  literally doesn’t think, she’s just basically a flesh suit furby, repeating the most recent phrase said to her” is problematic. It’s clearly and evidentially not true, but it’s close enough to a believable argument that it doesn’t come across as purely absurdist hyperbole, and so the person making that claim has now moved from “the actions she’s taking are harmful” to “she’s stupid”, and there’s no further path there for any form of constructive goal.   If the only thing you want to do is scream impotently into the void, then I guess that sort of statement might suit. But engaging in that behavior in that way is just prolonging the situation.

If you've found someone who will actually have a discussion about MTG's voting record with you, the presence of others engaging in non-""proper"" rhetoric isn't going to move the needle on that discussion. Whether or not that discussion goes ""well"" and they actually listen to you is up to who your discussion partner is, personally.  And the rusted on MAGAs aren't gonna listen to you. That's not because people on the internet called MTG ugly.",ChemicalRascal,2025-05-06T15:01:58,1

"????? First of all, allow me my first amendment right to be immature and uncaring.  It’s one thing to be a vapid and vile vessel that spews ignorance and filth but then at least be easy on the eyes- à là Nancy Mace, Tomi Lahren. But to do all this while being painful to look at is a crime against humanity. Trump is a salesman first. He understands that the messenger is often more important than the message and in many cases the messenger is even more important than what they are selling. There’s a reason your average female television host, journalist, commentator and even weather girl is probably a 6.5-7 in her prime. People are more amenable to attractive people, especially women. You wanna sell something to a man, use an attractive woman. You wanna sell something to a woman, use an attractive woman. Marge will never have a position in his cabinet. No shot he will wanna talk to or have to look at her in person on a consistent basis.",XSwaggnetox,2025-05-07T00:14:24,1
Yeah I thought net worth was only $ 4 mil. She’s doing well with all the insider trading tips,walker1954,2025-05-05T22:40:03,9
Then she stupidly thinks she’s all that!,walker1954,2025-05-05T22:31:55,1
Meh.  $22mil is admittedly more than I'm likely to ever have in this lifetime.  I just don't consider that to be really wealthy.  That's just a successful orthopedic surgeon with a good financial advisor wealthy.,happyinthenaki,2025-05-05T23:06:32,-2

"Which is funny, because being the media tank has always been Trump's true role. Anytime Trump says something asinine or makes an insane proposal, you have to check what is going on behind the scenes, because nearly everything he does is a distraction.  His father groomed him as a child to be as bombastic and attention drawing as possible and used Donald as a smokescreen for his own shady real estate dealings.  Honestly, Donald Trump is the greatest troll of all time, and these other clowns are living in his shadow.",PaddleFishBum,2025-05-06T08:44:35,2
