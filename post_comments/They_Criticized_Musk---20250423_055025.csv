"Freedom of speech now comes with a tier plan.   Basic Free Speech plan - people can say *whatever they want*. However they can still be arrested, deported, and silenced at any point by anyone who has the exclusive Iridium Speech plan. - The ultra wealthy and the current Government. Basic tier users *can* protest, but only performatively and with memeable protest signs, but nothing of actual consequence.   The silver Speech plan allows you to perform A  *light criticism* of Iridium trier people. You earn TBPs - Trump Brownie Points - which allows you limited topics to critique. This right can be revoked at any point if critism is deemed “too critical” or “too accurate” for Iridium tier folks to handle. These are people who lean into trumpism 99% of the time, retiring GOP officials, and a small number of Democrats.   The Gilded Speech plan - this is for government officials not in the Shite House as well as current Cabinet members and Supreme Court Justices - with this plan, they *appear* to have Free speech, but only if they say it quietly, with no one around, and not in public. In return, they receive stock tips, kickbacks, and comfy “positions of power” that nets them millions of dollars, which allows them Silver plan criticism with restrictions.  and finally the Iridium Tier plan - invite only - people in this tier can change the meaning of free speech at whim. These rules. Targeted at a single person, group, or society, “free speech plans can be revoked at will and at the sole discretion of the iridium plan member. They can ignore and invalidate all lower tiers plans speech and utilize the government to hunt down and remove any of their choosing. There is currently no restriction to speech with the iridium plan.   The company free speech plans reflect personal plans but are placed based on revenue generated for the country.  Small business remain on The Basic plan  Small regional chains with those with limited donations to the GOP - silver plan  Large companies with national reach and a moderate funding of iridium tier members personally- gilded tier + appointment of loyal members to government.

Fortunately I was able to find another job that gives me free time to pursue art, but I literally gave up on my dream in dropping Twitter.

I didn't delete mine as I want to keep the user name locked down but I only log in enough to keep it active. Never post never view anything. Hell I never posted anything on Twitter long before the 2016 election but I looked at it bit more.   Now if anything my account hurts the value of Twitter accounts as it does not generate add revenue or any revenue so drives down the per account value.   Fuck Twitter. Hell fuck Facebook as well but I at least have a use for that one and the adds there are still relative to me and the stuff it shows is still relative.

No you don't.

"I was the same, I stuck around there til just after the election as I didn't feel there was a replacement. Then when there was a big exodus to Bluesky after the election, I was glad to leave with them.   There are 35 million users on Bluesky now, and I've noticed more and more people like academics and researchers come over, as well as journalists, artists and people from various other communities I'm interested in.   What I kind of love is there's almost an unspoken agreement on Bluesky not to even engage with right wing trolls - they do pop up from time to time, but the majority ignores and blocks, so it's very hard for them to get a foothold.   I feel like there are enough reporters, organisations, artists etc on there at this point that it does replace Twitter for those on the left and in the center - and it's only going to keep growing. (I do get concerned that Trump will come for it at some point 😅)  My stress levels came down massively after leaving Twitter - the place feels like poison to the spirit now. I mean, all the political news is still awful on Blueskyof course, but it's a much more pleasant atmosphere and people there want to keep it that way.",seleona,2025-04-23T07:48:44,14

I also got the chance to tell Elon to go back to playing video games and recommended The Last of Us. He probably never saw it but it felt good.  Mind you, I was suspended twice.  Can't imagine why.  I maintain my account on BluSky to stay among sane people. Or mad people who aren't monsters like myself.",CT_Phipps-Author,2025-04-23T09:13:54,6

"Macy's doesn't make it's money from you being in there and looking at ads. that is the difference.

"The algorithm doesn't know whether your comment is trolling, it just counts any interaction with a post as ""enagement"" and decides to put that post in front of more eyeballs. So when you're doing your trolling, you're ultimately just becoming another view/comment and getting that account more views and money.",bringy,2025-04-23T13:43:56,5
"It's pretty straightforward, so I'll overexplain it.  You say you're trolling.  If you keep a handful of people -- most of whom aren't going to be using an ad blocker -- engaged for an extra few minutes, you do more harm than good.  Active user count, post and comment engagement are metrics used to drive ad sales.  Ad campaigns are paid on a budget where views and click thru drain the campaign pool, but the money is already in X's account.  You're kind of an ideal user because your browser never requests the ad that you were never going to click on anyway.  Which lets that ad campaign money go toward one of the people you are engaging instead.    Like, I'm not saying you're a big personality on Xitter, but just for the sake of argument, if you ran the Beyonce user account, do you think they would care if your one account blocked ads?  If you keep five people enraged and engaged for 5 extra minutes and all you did was login for 2 mins and shit post, you probably didn't help anything.  Ad blockers are catastrophic when a large percentage of a site's traffic is savvy users that block all ads, but Xitter isn't hurting for people to show ads to, even now.  Unless you're actively making people quit the site, you are probably doing more harm than good generating engagement and improving the click thru rate among browsers who request ads.",EndTimer,2025-04-23T13:47:06,3
