"Some of that does come from trouble defining ""left wing"" and ""right wing"" as these terms are very much based in local cultures and don't mean consistent things all the time.   ""Right wing"" is starting to have a populist connotation attached to it, at least in the English speaking world for example. That has really not been the case for much of democratic history. But I digress.   Left wing authoritarianism is usually used to refer to the USSR or China as obvious culprits, but there are dozens of other examples. Post colonial Africa is full of anti-colonial crusaders preaching equality only to become more brutal dictators than the colonial powers were. And often times they will evoke the idea of colonial powers as some justification for why their regime needs to be so brutal, trying to rebuild or reunify a country the white man tore apart, or something along those lines.   Or take Syria's Assad regime. It's called the Arab Socialist party. People in Syria pay no taxes, housing is heavily subsidized, so is gas, and honestly before the war, most needs were tended to by the government. What many might see as left wing. But simultaneously, dissent was not tolerated, secret police ensured politics were not really an acceptable topic of conversation outside of praise of the government, and generally, the opinions of the people only mattered insofar as preventing rebellion.   But if you're looking for examples closer to home, those are a little more difficult to find, but more importantly they run into local biases. What you see as legitimate government use of force is to someone else, an authoritarian crackdown. Canada has made what I would say are some concerning steps recently, but what others would say is totally justified. Holland also seems to be ignoring big segments of its population in order to pursue climate goals, a more left-wing objective. Are those authoritarian countries? Hardly. But nothing is ever really that binary in the real world.",notpoleonbonaparte,2023-07-02T14:14:04,34
"A lot of the replies here are not describing the concept of right (left) wing authoritarianism (RWA or LWA) in the academic sense. This is fine, but from what you write about, I assume that you are talking about the social psychology constructs, or - individual level authoritarianism.  In social and political psychology authoritarians are defined as people who are (1) submissive to authorities they believe are legitimate, (2) want others to submit to these authorities and (3) are aggresive towards those who do not submit to said authorities. Whether this is right wing or left wing depends on who the person believes the relevant authorities are. You can be a hardcore supporter of Trump and think that everyone should support his policies and be aggressive towards those who do not. That would make you a right wing authoritarian. The same could be said about a Sanders supporter who wants everyone to do as he says and is aggressive. That would make you a left wing authoritarian.  That being said, authoritarianism is a trait found more often among right wingers (at least in the West), and I think that's why some people have a harder time grasping that it can exist on the left too. If you are interested in this stuff, I can always recomend a reading list, but, of course, it might seem a bit too dense, as most academic stuff is.  Sorry for any mistakes, English is not my first language :)",[deleted],2023-07-03T14:25:18,6

"Your problem here is associating “left wing” with good and “authoritarian” with bad, so the phrase sounds like “good bad.” They are neutral terms with colloquial meanings.   “Authoritarianism” - the enforcement or advocacy of strict obedience to authority at the expense of personal freedom.  “Left Wing” - the section of a political party or system that advocates for greater social and economic equality, and typically favors socially liberal ideas; the liberal or progressive group or section  Examples:  1) Typically any policy that results in monetary re-distribution that is enforced by the state. Eg. *Progressive* taxes  2) Mask and vaccine mandates to protect a class of people, such as the elderly. These could be considered right wing under different excuses.  3) Mandating that businesses must make reasonable accommodations for and serve all classes of people.   4) The Supreme Court’s decision against Alabama can be considered left wing, and it can be considered authoritarian because the fed acts as a state actor over the individual states.  5) Honestly, a lot of the intellectual types out of Harvard, Yale, etc mean well but can have very authoritarian/statist/technocratic mindsets.   Right-wing authoritarians get a lot of coverage in part because they’re dangerous to democracy but also in part because a lot of the media leans left. Many sections of the progressive movement are actually quite authoritarian.   It’s up to you to decide whether certain decisions, policy positions, or ideologies are acceptable or desirable, regardless of the terms applied to them by intellectuals or pundits.",[deleted],2023-07-02T14:18:46,15

"Genuinely curious what you'd think of the Soviet Union if you're asking this question?   Left-wing politics is the politics of equality, or supposed equality anyway, rather than the politics of freedom (which is liberalism). If you take a moderate approach to equality or a lib-left approach to equality then typically it can have benefits towards freedom and it's why lefties and liberals often get on.   As you become more extreme in trying to achieve equality, you have to become more authoritarian and move away from liberalism. People have different wants, needs, desires, skills, mentalities, philosophies and handicaps. A central power can't equalise all of those things without forcing people. It's the height of arrogance to believe that a central power can work that all out and decide or correct it for people.   Thus a movement of liberation (from poverty or racism) towards equality can morph into one of oppression.",hungoverseal,2023-07-04T18:37:52,2

"It's kind of a fuzzy concept because once you start going authoritarian *period,* the specifics tend to blur a bit.  If you wanted to be seriously broad, the dividing line could probably best be described as an individualist focus (right wing) vs a collective focus (left wing.)   This is also a bit squishy given that many forms of right-wing authoritarianism often are leveraged on collective principles (fascism leans in that direction) but I think you can broadly say that a more left-wing authoritarianism tends to have a more all consuming view on the individual. Your own sense of self comes from belonging to the group and your needs and desires as an individual are secondary to the needs of the function of the group.  If you want to take this to the absolute extreme, you could use something like the Borg from Star Trek as the ultimate personification of the tyranny of the group over the individual at the expense of the individual. There's some back-and-forth in the show about members of the Borg feeling ""welcome"" in the collective but whatever goals and desires they have as individuals is seconded to the needs of the collective as a whole.  On a more practical level, you can look at some of the more intense forms of big ""C"" Communism as on that path. North Korea's theoretical brand of Communism, *Juche,* recognizes the individual but pretty flatly states that the individual's first responsibility is to see to the needs of the society as a whole.   Once you start getting up into that strata of society, the difference between left and right tends to dissipate somewhat because the actual mechanisms that maintain an authoritarian state tend to be very similar regardless of the ideology that motivates them.  >On a more reasonable level, I could see stuff like socialist revolutions, violent protests, or just hyper-PC SJW types (the kind of split hairs over minor nonsense that benefits no one) as actual examples.   This...makes no sense.  How are ""violent protests"" or ""hyper-PC SJW types"" considered ""left-wing authoritarianism?""

"Authoritarianism can be left-wing or right-wing. Robespierre was left-wing, him and the Jacobins pretty much originated the term “left-wing.” He doggedly pursued a program of tearing down what he saw as unjust hierarchies, promoting equal rights for racial minorities, expanding universal suffrage, and derived all his legitimacy from a perception that he and his government represented the “general will” of the people. However, he committed horrible atrocities (despite his personal opposition to the death penalty) because of his belief that it was necessary to create an egalitarian utopia and stop conservatives/reactionaries from resurrecting the ancien regime and enslaving the people.

"Electoral college isn’t due to slavery but because the framers thought that state governments would be better at selecting a president than the general public (*see* Federalist 68, Hamilton). Additionally, the bias in favor of small states in the electoral college was a result of small northern states like Rhode Island and Connecticut not wanting proportional power to each state  As for first past the post, nothing to do with slavery but a product of Britain using FPTP, the framers carrying over the British model, and alternative voting systems weren’t yet fully developed. Proportional voting assumes political parties exist and the first parties in the US didn’t form until after the constitution’s ratification, Madison’s “anti-administration” faction during the Washington administrations. Also ranked choice voting was a fringe idea at the time and wasn’t really applied anywhere until the late nineteenth century  As for the slavery, that was more just an example. That democracy without limits, Rousseau style, a majority vote/the “general will” can do no wrong, doesn’t work if you have an oppressed minority and a majority that supports the oppression; robust enforcement of something akin to the Equal Protection Clause and the Bill of Rights is necessary. Even if slaves could vote in 1860 (just hypothetical) it wouldn’t do much good in a state like Virginia where the 69.3% free population was pretty widely in favor of keeping up the repression of the 30.7 slave population)",[deleted],2023-07-31T08:30:13,1
"> what is so progressive about Kemal’s program?  Mustafa Kemal inherited a by-and-large ethnically and religiously monomorphic Anatolian society of Sunni Muslim Turks, and in a radical break with the past, unprecedented not just for Turkey, but in all human history, after the Turkish Republic was declared, and the sultanate abolished, the only thing that the republic kept from the past was the flag.  >“The politician who needs help of religion to govern is nothing but an idiot!”  >“For more than 500 years, the rules and theories of the Ancient Arab sheik Muhammad, and the absurd interpretations by generations of filthy and ignorant clergymen in Turkey, dictated all civil and criminal laws. They dictated the state of the constitution, the smallest of activities and gestures of citizens, their diet, the hours of rest and labor, the choice of clothing, the curriculum in schools, our manners, and habits, and even our most intimate thoughts. Islam is a rotting corpse, that is poisoning all our lives.”  >“There are many different nations, but there is only one civilization. A prerequisite for the progress within a nation is to be a part of that civilization.”  >“There are no differences between the orient and the occident, there is only the difference between backwardness and modernity.”  – Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, speaking like a contemporary radical US progressive, if you replace “Islam” with “Christianity”  In 1923, 80% of Turkey’s population lived in the countryside. 90% could neither read nor write. Ideas such as nationalism, republicanism, liberalism, progress, modernity, science, or secularism were something most people had never even heard of. A national identity didn't exist, and most group identities were restricted to clans, religious groups, and family structures within rural villages.  However, within a period of 14 years, the world of the average Turk was turned completely on its head.  0. On the 3rd of march 1924, Mustafa Kemal formally abolished the caliphate  The caliph was the spiritual descendant of Muhammad, representing his authority to all Muslims. The caliphate had existed since Islam itself existed. The title had gone from the Umayyads, to the Abbasids, to the Ottomans, and was seen as an integral part of the Islamic faith. Mustafa Kemal decided to abolish an institution that he thought of as “too backwards” to be reformed, and therefore had to be destroyed. But for him, that was just the starting shot. He followed it up by:  1. banning the fez, turbans, niqab, and burqa 1. banning the hijab in public spaces, such as schools and government buildings 1. telling women (who had been silent figures forced into the background by religion) to come forward and be public figures 1. closing all Islamic schools (at the time, all schools were Islamic schools, and the Sunni clergy held a monopoly on education) 1. opening new schools on an entirely secular curriculum 1. scrapping religion entirely out of education 1. making education compulsory 1. also making education compulsory for girls (previously denied any and all education) 1. granting all women legal equality before the law 1. abolishing the Islamic calendar 1. abolishing sharia law in its totality, in each and every corner of the legal code, be it civil or criminal law 1. ending special taxes for non-Muslims 1. ending restrictions of freedoms 1. ending prohibition of alcohol 1. ending punishments for apostasy 1. introducing freedom of consciousness 1. allowing Muslims to convert to other faiths 1. allowing Muslims to be open atheists 1. legalizing marriages between faiths 1. allowing mixed-faith couples to raise children together 1. abolishing the Islamic courts 1. abolishing sharia justices 1. abolishing the sheikhal Islam (the highest religious legal authority) 1. introducing a civil code of criminal and civil laws shaped after Western examples 1. banning the call to prayer from minarets at mosques 1. making all imams state bureaucrats, on government payroll, under control by a secular government institution 1. mandating state-approval of religious sermon content 1. abolishing preaching in Arabic 1. mandating preaching in the Turkish language 1. latinizing the Turkish alphabet (previously Persian Arabic) 1. replacing the alphabet at all state, commercial, and schooling institutions 1. mandating that all adults learn the new alphabet 1. mandating that all children be raised with the new alphabet  Government advisors cautioned Mustafa Kemal to do this slowly, and that it could only be done over a decade, but he had all of this pushed in 5 months. Next:  1. all Turks had to take last names (until then, there was no such thing as a last name or a family name) 1. Islam (the official religion of the state) was cut out of the republic's constitution 1. secularism was written into the constitution, defining the Turkish Republic as a state that separates religion and state (“secularism” here being understood as the more radical French “laïcité”, i.e. freedom “from” religion, and not merely freedom “of” religion) 1. banning religious dress from all government and public institutions (from parliament to school) 1. forbidding any and all religiously-inspired or -dictated social policy (either through private organizations or elected officials)  Society was torn down to then be rebuilt and modeled after the European states of the time, but Atatürk didn't just want to catch up with the modernity of his neighbors – he wanted to outdo them. At the turn of the decade, women's equality movements had sprung into action as they had never before in human history, and this is where Atatürk saw an opportunity to show off the progress of his new society to the outside world, and to even hint on how his new republic might soon overtake all the others:  1. mirroring how the ottomans had previously made a point of showing off their princes to the outside world, Atatürk adopted several young girls who showed promise in education and accomplishments, such as Afet İnan (who became an accomplished anthropologist and historian) and Sabiha Gökçen (who became the world's first air force pilot) and presented them throughout the world as symbols of progress within the Turkish republic 1. most countries represent themselves for national symbols such as a national animal, so Atatürk decided that the symbol of Turkey was to be a [modern, dark-haired Turkish woman, leading the nation to progress](https://i.redd.it/6ksz64bzsbz41.jpg)  These were the images that Atatürk wanted the world to see, so Turkey would no longer be seen as a weird, backward nation where veiled women are hidden behind closed doors, but as a forward-thinking republic where a female president of a university, and an acclaimed historian, can congratulate American women on receiving the right to vote and finally being the equals of their Turkish sisters (as you see in 1920s interview clips in the video).  Then, one of Atatürk’s biggest projects was his new capital – moved from Istanbul to Ankara. Ankara was a small town with a population of barely 30k, so over it he built a new city for a new state in a new century, inviting many modernist architects (such as Bruno Taut, Clemens Holzmeister, and Paul Bonatz) to build the futuristic Ankara that we know today, detached from many concepts of traditional middle eastern styles.  All of these reforms – the complete restructuring and reorganizing of a society, in such a radical way, like it had never been done before (or since) in human history – happened within 14 years, between 1923 and 1937. The goal behind them was to create a modern state, shaped after the European republics.  In Atatürk’s “educating dictatorship”, he saw it as his role to rule as a dictator until the public would finally be educated enough to see the validity of these reforms and elect them through their own volition. He saw himself as the first and last dictator of Turkey, the one dictator that the nation needed to educate it into never having another dictator again:  1. he encouraged opposition figures to found a liberal opposition party 1. he attempted to gradually democratize society 1. he established a national security council to intervene in the politics of the country if the constitution was ever under threat of being undermined  I don’t want to dig deeper than this to find more stuff, but do you see the “progressive authoritarianism” now?",Jtcr2001,2023-07-31T16:34:35,1
"I feel like you’re taking the word “progressive here” to mean this loose collection of ideas we can historically project onto people, or as this amorphous word which just means forward momentum. So I’m gonna tackle this just directly. You’re kinda buying Kemal’s nationalist propaganda here.   Being anti religious or a secular reformer doesn’t make you progressive, nor does being a nationalist who promotes education. There are tons of leaders who have promoted education in the past, or removing religious rights, but that hardly qualifies as the definition of progressive. He forcefully removed the veil from many - this decision was not entirely popular. And whether or not I support Islamic jurisprudence, Ottoman jurisprudence by the 20th c had already removed a great deal of arbitrary religious from the courts, and created a relatively stable common-law like system built around religion as a moral basis for laws supplemented by state law. In many ways, this is a really repressive decision - hence authoritarianism. But what makes taking away religious rights progressive? You can argue here he forcefully secularized the country for sure and assaulted those who would oppose it - but that isn’t progressive to my mind. I won’t disagree that adding additional rights and guarantees to the constitution is good, but freedom of religion in law had existed since the 1880s and de facto existed for years prior.   If we’re talking about the program of economic and political modernization (and here I use the word in reference to literature of political economy and development) which Turkey underwent you could call him a moderniser in the very classical sense. The aim was to copy western institutions, cultural affectations, etc because they were detested and seen as backwards externally. Internally, there was a lot of upset, but it more lay with how the Islamic courts and caliphate reinforced each other against the parliaments democratic authority. Several previous multiethnic multi religious constitutions had been attempted alongside more democratic authority, esp since the Ghulane Rescript. This was halted owing to the Caliph, backed by Western financiers who had taken control of Ottoman financing during the previous financial crisis. Economic modernisation was aimed at competing with Western economic and social prestige, and it was accomplished by seizing minority groups assets and redistributing them to Turks. So if this is “progressivism” then we better call Hitler “progressive” for his generous redistributive programs with Jewish gold and the useless eaters.   Education reform here is also a part of it. You need education to have a population like the West. But what’s important here is that ‘modernisation’ here is a political project - a distinct idea of where a type of ‘progress’ is going and how we should get there, via forms of classical economic and political liberalism, (not the liberalism you and I know today, but it’s less friendly night watchman cousin). Big buildings unrelated architecturally to previous historic traditions isn’t progressive - it’s modern. Cities growing bigger isn’t progressive - it’s modern. Educational programs designed to be funded on state taxes (a sophisticated system preceding the Turks that Kemal took from the Ottomans because their bureaucracy was so impressive, even by European standards) are a modern idea - which is also arguably progressive, but not enough in and of itself to claim this person is progressive. There are plenty of non-progressives who support education, even for the same reasons I do, though their conclusions and assumptions typically diverge. The alphabet is also instructive, owing to the need to distance themselves from any affiliation with Arabic, Muslims, or Arabs (who must be backward) by adopting a Latinized alphabet with new spellings from minority language in the region. How is this progressive? It was simply to modernize something seen as backwards inherently - not because it was progressive to do.  Atatürk inherited a collapsing multiethnic multi religious empire he converted into a nation-state built on expropriation, ethnic cleansing, and genocide of multiple internal populations (again - Armenians, Greeks, Assyrians, etc) who had their property taken, and were either forcefully or indirectly sent from the country elsewhere, to their deaths, or relegated into poverty. It was not what you described at all. The Ottoman Empire which preceded Turkey underwent such dramatic changes in those years that one can hardly call the two the same polity or even relate them outside of drawing historical lineages. The women’s movement was in action long before Kemal even was a child dreaming of joining to fight in WWI at Galipoli. There were plenty of women who walked without veils in society. This wasn’t a previously backward society. He constructed Turkish identity as a tool for himself and his party. Though he may have advanced “the nation” in some abstract way which can be observed in more concrete forms, his political project wasn’t progressive unless by progressive you just mean the word forward moving as opposed to static. Transposing a word like progressive onto a ethnocentric nationalist dictator who violently built a nation-state out of a multi religious multi ethnic empire is not really accurate in my mind. It just doesn’t really capture his politics accurately or adequately, which would be the point of using terms like this. It’d be better to say he was a ethno nationalist and an authoritarian, who sought to Westernizer and undertake a campaign of violent modernisation during the 1920s after a revolution. Atatürk wasn’t all bad. I’m not saying he was. But his political project was complicated.",ITrulyWantToDie,2023-08-02T08:27:48,1
"Thank you for the extremely informative reply, as I know very little about this subject aside from what I learned through that video series.  It does seem, indeed, that our divergence comes from different ideas of what progressivism is, because I still hold that Atatürk was significantly progressive. My view of what progressivism is comes from my formal education in philosophy, as a political philosophy that stands in opposition to conservatism and is closely associated with the reformist agendas of liberalism and socialism (mainly, but not exclusively). However, for a more down-to-earth description, I'll appeal to the first paragraph of Wikipedia's article on Progressivism, which does an okay job:  > Progressivism holds that it is possible to **improve human societies** through political action. As a political movement, progressivism seeks to advance the human condition through **social reform** based on purported advancements in **science, technology, economic development, and social organization.** Adherents hold that progressivism has **universal application** and endeavor to **spread** this idea to human societies **everywhere.** Progressivism arose during the Age of Enlightenment out of the belief that **civility in Europe** was improving due to the application of **new empirical knowledge** to the governance of society.  It is this political philosophy, diametrically opposed to conservatism (but without being merely reactionary), that I see in Atatürk.  Without undue assumptions, may I ask if your notion of progressivism is what is being referenced in the very next paragraph of the same Wikipedia article?  > In modern political discourse, progressivism gets often associated with social liberalism, a left-leaning type of liberalism, in contrast to the right-leaning neoliberalism, combining support for a mixed economy with cultural liberalism.",Jtcr2001,2023-08-02T11:44:06,2
I really like the dialogue between you both. It is informative and did not devolve into what I usually see in many other forums.,igankcheetos,2024-04-30T17:27:53,1
I am flattered! And glad that someone found it informative.,Jtcr2001,2024-05-01T17:56:26,1
