Constitutionally limited governance and separation of powers. Government can't exercise powers it doesn't have.   Notably progressives who are most worried about the rise of fascism are also the people most against constitutional limited governance because it is a massive roadblock towards their goal of rapid change and the idea that government should be able to do whatever it needs to advance their policy.,JudgeWhoOverrules,2024-06-19T11:33:33,13
"I’ll echo everyone else’s points about separation of powers and further offer [CGP Grey’s “Rules for Rulers”](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs) which covers what forms of government tend to form under certain conditions, specifically stability and instability in addition to how a large amount of “keys to power” makes it hard for an individual/organization have absolute power.",27_obstinate_cattle,2024-06-19T20:18:16,3
" No.  Same as you can't build an economical system that is immune to financial criss.   Political systems are not ""real"", they are a game with rules agreed upon by the people of the same country.   As long as the people keep playing by the rules, it works but ones strong emotions kick in, it's impossible to stop the fascism train.   Notice how all the populist movements in the west target the Supreme Court firs thing, inciting the masses againts it. It's their way to ""change the game""   The only real way to fight fascism is with quality education for everyone and minimize discrimination between different groups and demographics.   Populist fascist leaders these days do the exact opposite, they pray on the uneducated (uneducated = fearfull) and play on discriminated groups.",aurevoirshoshana66,2024-06-20T01:41:03,1

Pure democracy is always at risk to devolve into authoritarianism because people vote in their own self interest and the majority will always vote to take from the minority.,enemy884real,2024-06-20T13:48:00,1
"I'd argue that with Trump, we saw a democracy pushed to its limits, and the system we design protected us from Fascism. We got close, and a lot of people's rights were impacted and will continue to be by the Supreme Court that was chosen, but, those are things where legislatures can step in and there is ebb and flow over decades. Ultimately we didn't descend into Fascism even when the Capitol was physically invaded by Fascists.  It's about checks and balances in a multi-pronged system of government. In the end, even with conservative and liberal justices on the Supreme Court, we see a willingness to largely protect the bones of American democracy. Even when one or two Justices gets extreme, the other ones on their side of the bench pull to the center. That sad, we probably do need a system that keeps one president from nominating more than a couple of justices. That would really help protect us.   Agree with the above commenter who talks about military people who follow their oath. We know under Trump that leaders with access to nuclear codes said that they would never improperly launch a nuclear missile no matter what the president said.   Also agree with the above about education. Ultimately while some people may want to descend into Fascism, when the bulk of the population knows just how far is too far, we're protecting ourselves.",VoteSwappingUSA,2024-06-27T18:15:29,1
"Let's start by ditching the term 'fascism' and using the more accurate term 'authoritarianism'. 'Fascism' describes a specific set of mid-20th century governments and is only used in the modern day as a 'scary word'.  So how do we prevent authoritarianism? Probably the best solution is term limits - not just from the standpoint of elected officials but also most government employees with any sort of policy-related role.  The benefit of term limits is twofold.  The first is that they create a constant churn in government where no faction can easily assume control over any particular area of government. The foundation of authoritarian rule is stable factions.  The second is that a government official who knows they'll be leaving their position has to plan on what comes next. Whatever that official does in office, someone will be checking their work when they leave - and they'll potentially have to suffer the consequences of their misdeeds. If the official knows this won't happen for decades - maybe not even until after they die - they'll have an incentive to avoid doing things that they might not be able to justify later.",ViskerRatio,2024-06-29T07:25:51,1
"As a guess:  Separation of powers   A military headed by people who take their oath to the constitution seriously   Making sure the police (who will be on the front end of civil disobedience efforts and pro democracy riots) have a lot of ideological diversity and are not staffed with fascists themselves (84% of cops voted for Trump in 2016,  for example)  An independent judiciary who themselves have overseers and mandatory codes of ethics and requirements to follow the constitution. For example, when judge Roy Moore refused to follow a federal judicial order to remove the 10 commandments, Alabama judicial ethics panels removed Roy Moore from the bench  An educated population capable of critical thinking   Strong labor unions, student activist movements, and an alliance between the center left and far left to resist fascism together rather than infighting about purity tests (good luck with that)  An armed populace  Requirements that politicians be able to pass the same ethical, financial, moral and criminal background checks that intelligence and military officials need to pass to obtain security clearance.  A populace who is capable of organizing a coalition of far left, center left, and center right activists to engage in mass civil disobedience together.",Five_Decades,2024-06-19T18:39:09,0
>Notably progressives who are most worried about the rise of fascism are also the people most against constitutional limited governance because it is a massive roadblock towards their goal of rapid change and the idea that government should be able to do whatever it needs to advance their policy.  Which is why fascism from the left is such an insidious threat. It could easily be instituted as a defense against injustice from the right.,ddgr815,2024-06-19T18:00:14,3

"Fascism relies on an all powerful government. Increasing government power and scope is inherently left wing, because giving up freedom is the fastest way to make the changes.",enemy884real,2024-06-20T13:51:37,1
">Increasing government power and scope is inherently left wing  This is not true.  Some of the left-wing communes of France would have a huge bone to pick with that.  There are really *two* axes for political thought.  There's the left-right axis we all are familiar with, but there's also a vertical axis between authoritarianism and individualism that is often times ignored.  And I'd argue its not really a square (PCM be damned) but its more of a diamond - the more authoritarian you become, the left/right starts to fade as more an excuse for the power, not the reason for the power.  That's why the whole fascism/communism debate of Nazi Germany and the USSR is kind of potato/potatoe - both wanted absolutely power in the hands of the government; whom they ruled on behalf was a big difference, as was their methods to get there, but ultimately it was for their version of the whole.",AuditorTux,2024-06-20T16:42:43,2

"You're talking the vertical axis then.  You could also argue that the left/right could be more ""collectivist"" versus ""individualism"" in that context.  You could have a left-wing/collectivist freedom-based society (ancomm) sitting next to a right-wing/individualist freedom-based society (ancap).   At some point, as they get more and more on that vertical axis, they start to converge again, hence why I said its more diamond rather than square.",AuditorTux,2024-06-20T16:50:05,2
