That is a fireable offense at my job. We have higher standards than the dang white house,Mark_Pollock,2025-05-06T14:32:44,272
"NEW: Tulsi Gabbard, now the US director of national intelligence, used the same easily cracked password for different online accounts including a personal Gmail account and Dropbox over a period of years, leaked records reviewed by WIRED reveal.  The password associated with the accounts in question includes the word ‚Äúshraddha,‚Äù which appears to have personal significance to Gabbard: This year, The Wall Street Journal reported that she had been initiated into the Science of Identity Foundation, which ex-members have accused of being a cult.  Security experts advise people to never use the same password on different accounts precisely because people often do so. As director of national intelligence, Gabbard oversees the 18 organizations comprising the US intelligence community.

"> The password she used was ""shraddha"", a brute force attack against a password database would crack this password in about 3 hours.  Online password strength calculators are pretty unreliable and the speed entirely depends on how the password is hashed and how much hardware you throw at cracking. Using a [single 5090](https://gist.github.com/Chick3nman/09bac0775e6393468c2925c1e1363d5c) set to alphanumeric characters only, 'shraddha' would take on average:    md5($pass) - 8.25 minutes   sha1($pass) - 25.9 minutes   sha256crypt - 1.3 years   bcrypt(sha1($pass)) - 13.4 years   bcrypt(md5($pass)) - 13.5 years   scrypt - 446 years    But none of that really matters since 'shraddha' exists on pwnedpasswords' known passwords list, which would significantly cut down all these times since you always do a dictionary attack first (or check rainbow table for md5/sha1)",312c,2025-05-06T15:25:29,22
