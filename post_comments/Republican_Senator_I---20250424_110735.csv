"This is no hyperbole. Republicans, both politicians and voters, believe that welfare is almost exclusively people of color who refuse to work.

Medicaid has been subsidizing health care for big corporations who purposely don’t schedule staff with enough hours and keep wages low so they’ll qualify. It’s a grift that the billionaires have supported forever.,missmeowwww,2025-04-24T14:18:59,8

"You can read Medicaid data for yourself. It is there (or used to be, not sure if Trump removed it yet) in the SSA data archives. The thing is, the more peoples' healthcare it taken care of, the harder they work. The more health problems a person has, the less they work. This simple concept is the reason why universal healthcare is thriving in almost every single developed nation EXCEPT the USA. We, and we alone, are facing multiple health crises post-covid, almost exclusively due to relying on privatized insurance.  Every single dollar that goes into medicaid, AND foodstamps, is some of the best-spent tax dollars you can possibly have. And there would be MORE tax dollars available, if Medicaid and foodstamps were EXPANDED and better funded.",ragingreaver,2025-04-24T12:17:43,10

"As I wrote, anecdotal evidence isn’t definitive proof but when I left the military with an Honorable Discharge more than 42 years ago, I lost my healthcare because I stopped earning it. Neither my employer nor my neighbors should have to fund my life choices. If the value of my labor to my employer is insufficient to cause him to provide benefits - health insurance, paid vacation, breaks, etc - then I don’t get them.

Some parents don't make enough money to provide much in the way of child support. Some parents are dead and didn't have much to leave to support the family.  It's not just deadbeat parents. This is why we have social safety nets.,Professional-Can1385,2025-04-24T12:35:34,6
"Why not? If you’re healthy enough to be on a golf course - look at who is turning into their driveway during the middle of the day - you don’t get to have someone else contribute to your wellbeing. Now, if there’s a voluntary, non-profit charitable funded organization that wants to support this, then that’s their right. It is their money after all. But to confiscate the costs is wrong.

"""That's how capitalism fails.""   Fixed it for you.   We'd all be better off pooling resources and investing in healthcare instead of what we have now. That's how the rest of the developed world handles it for lower per capita cost and better outcomes.",Reasonable-Bus-2187,2025-04-24T15:53:33,2
