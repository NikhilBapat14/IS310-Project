After Vance killed the pope he went to India where there was a terrorist attack on Kashmir so I’d say they’ve got a handle on it.   /s,bassplayerguy,2025-05-07T17:58:17,2

"I'm not fan of Pakistan's government but they're the only side in this conflict calling for an independent investigation which is backed by several neighboring countries. India is rejected an independent third-party investigation. Modi, his party, and far-right militia that backs them repeatedly use anti-Pakistan and Islamaphobic sentiment in their rhetoric and the Modi's allies in the region tried to blame the 2002 train burning on an attack caused by an outside Muslim mob on orders from Pakistan, despite forensic evidence and multiple independent commissions determining the fire was internally started and dismissing all conspiracies.   If Modi gets the green light and international backing, his military, and far-right Hindutva militias will commit horrific atrocities in Pakistan and towards Muslims residing within India that will make the 2002 pogroms look like child's play.",papibigdaddy,2025-05-08T01:17:16,-1
