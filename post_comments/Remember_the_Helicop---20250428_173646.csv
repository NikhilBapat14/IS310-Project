Not gonna see this anywhere outside of this sub.,Baptism-Of-Fire,2025-04-28T19:21:53,248
Anybody with a brain knew it was the Black Hawk pilot’s fault. Cutting across the glide slope of a high volume class B airport is basic aviation knowledge you learn in your PPL course. The worst enemy to a pilot is complacency.,sunkenship13,2025-04-28T19:43:43,205
A tragic accident that was unnecessarily politicized.,bearcatjoe,2025-04-28T21:27:57,119

"We knew this the day it happened.  Everything around air traffic control is recorded and supervised. You can listen to the recording from that event yourself if you want, it's all completely transparent. Controllers can be held responsible for accidents so they diligently keep records to avoid any ambiguity as to who is at fault when the formal investigation occurs.  DOGE has been a waste of time and money but it's a fact that no controllers have been fired. The probationary workers (not controllers) that were fired were offered their jobs back.",raxitron,2025-04-29T10:39:04,6
"Yep! Here on Reddit I've seen both r\/Aviation and r\/AirCrashInvestigation actively removing any article, post or comments on the accident. What a strange anti-free speech platform we find ourselves on!",DogsLoveMeCatsHateMe,2025-04-28T19:49:57,160
Yep! Whenever the truth comes out the mainstream news media is quick to bury it.,Royal_IDunno,2025-04-28T23:34:46,27
She was on her 5th fucking attempt of this training exercise,spezeditedcomments,2025-04-28T21:06:03,132
Yep. Juan does a great job explaining what happened on his YouTube channel blancolirio. I just feel horrible for the 80+ people they killed. ATC is partly at fault too. I’m sure that guy is done as well.,Dupagoblin,2025-04-28T20:44:55,6

I found posts about it on r/Aviation.  They're still up  There are a few removed comments on the posts because politics aren't allowed,you_cant_prove_that,2025-04-29T11:10:56,13
I posted another story about this same thing only to have this subreddit remove it. I was shocked it went through this time.,Wing_attack_Plan_R,2025-04-29T10:42:42,3
Why don't they train pilots in the middle of nowhere before training them on big cities. Thank God the debris didn't fall on buildings because the results could be even more catastrophic.,dankhorse25,2025-04-29T00:19:33,70

"I don't know what the mods are up to here, I post good sources of events that conservatives would like to see and it just never gets through mod review, meanwhile the same few bots are pumping garbage articles all day and they get through.",Baptism-Of-Fire,2025-04-29T11:21:42,2
"Because she was an aide as well for the Biden admin, as a young attractive pilot.   She was arm candy and not some young stellar pilot.",spezeditedcomments,2025-04-29T11:14:30,7

I know. I’ve noticed the mods here will absolutely block any story I try to post concerning LQBTQ+. Even this subreddit thinks that they’re above being criticized.,Wing_attack_Plan_R,2025-04-29T11:26:35,3
surprisingly good takes in there,Baptism-Of-Fire,2025-04-29T13:11:08,1
