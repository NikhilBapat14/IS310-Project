"> The University of Pennsylvania violated federal civil rights law by allowing transgender swimmer Lia Thomas to compete on its women’s team during the 2021-22 season and use the female facilities, the U.S. Department of Education said Monday.   > The department has ordered Penn to “restore to all female athletes all individual athletic records, titles, honors, awards or similar recognition for Division I swimming competitions misappropriated by male athletes” or risk the loss of federal funding.  > President Donald Trump’s administration has already paused $175 million in funding to Penn because of Thomas’ participation. The university had said it previously had not received any demands to get funding restored.  > But it looks like that may have changed. In addition to restoring the records, the education department in its communication Monday listed two other requirements: the school must issue a statement to the Penn community that it will comply with Title IX and send a letter of apology to each swimmer whose record is restored “for allowing her educational experience in athletics to be marred by sex discrimination.”",nosotros_road_sodium,2025-04-29T00:10:17,-1

I do think it's an issue that can be solved rather easily.   Trans athletes should have their own competitions and only be allowed to compete with other trans athletes.  The fact that people defend allowing a male to compete with females is insane to me. It's unfair for the females. This is probably the only thing I'll ever agree with the trump administration on.  In any sports setting the male will always have an advantage. Always. This should be common sense but unfortunately I live in America in 2025.,Weekly-Trash-272,2025-04-29T00:18:05,-23

"Nobody is saying males should compete with females. The argument that trans women, who I should note are women, shouldn't compete with biological women is contingent on buying into the idea that trans athletes being at a biological advantage holds any weight. It doesn't. Tall people are at a biological advantage in basketball, but nobody says tall players should be banned from basketball. People with broader frames are at a biological advantage in power lifting - but nobody says broad shouldered people should be banned from power lifting. Biological advantage is not a valid argument in sports participation. Furthermore, some biological females also have high testosterone levels, but basically nobody says they should be banned from female sports competitions despite having the literal same advantage trans women supposedly have.",OtonaNoAji,2025-04-29T00:24:48,9

"People try to make the issue political and polarize it for their own agenda, but the issue is simple at the core.  You can have females that train their entire life in a certain sport and then have a trans male come in and one up them by many magnitudes. Not because the male is better, but because they're biologically equipped to perform better. It's simple science.  Nobody wants to say it's unfair for the females because then you're anti trans when in reality this is the reason we have different gender teams in the first place.  And to your statement, the ladies that are competing with this trans athlete are not okay with it. In fact many have come out and spoken against it. Others don't want to because they fear being targeted. The people cheering for the trans athletes give no shits about the other athletes.  Crazy world we live in.",Weekly-Trash-272,2025-04-29T00:27:53,-13
"""Don't be a science denier."" is just Trump for ""I have never read a study or had an independent thought.""  Trans people have never, ever, dominated any sport gendered or not. They have not dominated in any age bracket. There has not been a single world class solo-athlete at the Olympics or another comparable level of sport. You are not just denying science that has proven that their ability, after hormonal transition, which is when they are allowed into the sport, is equal to those of their cis-gender peers, but you are also denying reality in which no trans person has ever come even close to the feats you think they did.   This is just blatant, mindless hate on the basis of a feeling instilled into you by people that will grind you down into a paste if it so much as makes a cent more than keeping you alive. Your actions make women less save. Your actions make sports even less inclusive in a time where obesity is sky-high. You disgust me.",OzymandiasRaven,2025-04-29T01:31:02,16
