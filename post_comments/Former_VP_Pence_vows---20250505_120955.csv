I misread that as current VP Vance was going to get on Trump's ass if he isn't based enough. I can only hope.,Lord_Elsydeon,2025-05-05T15:01:11,42
"The do-nothing GOP is still angry that we're not nominating them to lead the party anymore.  Keep primarying incumbents, if they're still complaining then we're not done putting them out to pasture.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-05-05T12:20:32,141
"Pence is one of the last vestiges of the W. Bush neocon Republicans. The sooner that ilk is gone, the better off the country will be.",-DizzyPanda-,2025-05-05T12:26:43,86
If Mr Trump does something pence doesn’t like…  He’ll send in the troubleshooter…  pences pet……the fly 🤪  (For those that remember),tsoxiko,2025-05-05T16:34:44,10
"And so a familiar pattern develops again - vilification from the left when you're in power, followed by praise and ""respect"" when they line up with the left and admonish their foes. We've seen this play out countless times, from John McCain, to Mitt Romney, Liz Cheney and now of course Pence.  The fact he even shows up to accept a reward for kowtowing to the left over something like J6 ultimately tells you everything you need to know about his character.",WPWeasel,2025-05-05T12:37:30,40
"This man just needs to fade away into obscurity, much like his presidential campaign. He is a feckless coward that is so forgettable that most people won't even remember he was VP in 20 years.",VerusPatriota,2025-05-05T12:48:09,38

"Oh, great. I was waiting with bated breath for Pence to make this announcement. All is well now.......",Uller85,2025-05-05T13:09:28,7
Oh no he’s going to speak out… What did he do the past 3 years exactly.  He’s got nothing to say or he would have said it,MapleMonstera,2025-05-05T12:52:58,7
Oh noes!,Flare4roach,2025-05-05T12:14:55,7
"Remember when the left breathlessly warned that if Trump was elected in 2016, Pence was going to create electro-shock conversion therapy camps? What an amazing glow up he's had with them since then.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-05-05T13:17:07,6
Oh no... Anyways,woodm872,2025-05-05T14:32:33,4
"And Pence can STFU. Trump was elected because the electorate did NOT want the ""conservative agenda"". Where in the fuck along the lines did you guys forget you're there to represent us, we're not here to support you and your elitist ideas of what's best for us. Either support the policies we want, which right now means support Trump, or get the fuck out and let in some people that will actually represent us, and not the big money guys that put money in your pockets.  TL:DR - Fuck Pence.",JustinCayce,2025-05-05T15:53:54,3

He's going to be speaking a lot then since Trump isn't a traditional conservatives. Some overlap and some differences.,DogeBane,2025-05-05T13:22:37,0

Is it something in the air in Boston or the water they drink that causes Conservatives like Pence to  speak this way while there or was it just because he didn’t want to offend those who gave him an award?,Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-05-05T13:05:21,1

"Conservatives' biggest gripe with Republican politicians is that they're all talk, no action.  And here Pence isn't threatening to take action, he's threatening to talk.  Yes bro, doing more of what makes people dislike you is the way. 🤦‍♂️",Vektor0,2025-05-05T18:20:07,42

">We've seen this play out countless times, from John McCain, to Mitt Romney, Liz Cheney and now of course Pence.   Agree, these wanna be conservatives don't deserve the attention they are getting.  They've done nothing but aid and abet the leftist program of exterminating freedom and rule of law in America.",GiediOne,2025-05-05T16:12:05,6
"Disagreeing with Trump doesn’t make you a scumbag. If you can’t find one thing you disagree with Trump on, you should do some self reflection.   Pence is a principled guy and sacrificed his political career for what he thought was right. I don’t agree  with Pence on everything or even closely follow his talking points, but I respect him.",PM_ME_UR_VSKA_EXPLOD,2025-05-06T09:56:03,6
"The difference is he actually took a stand when it mattered, and most conservatives here hate him for it.",check_your_bias7,2025-05-05T18:28:57,-6
"He got Trump elected the first time. There is no way enough Evangelicals would have voted for him if Pence wasn't there. Pence was fine, justified in being upset with Trump for saying crap like he could stop the certification of the election. He seems like a standup guy who did his job, which was hard under Trump as a VP, never made a spectacle of himself keeping Trump in the spotlight. And his VP debate was killer too.",LeeroyJenkins11,2025-05-05T15:05:45,73

">Pence was fine, justified in being upset with Trump  Pence was clueless about the Leftist voting industrial complex that the goverment under the auspicious of USAID promulgated.
