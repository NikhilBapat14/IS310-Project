"""It's time to get her OUT and hire a new guy for the job!"".  It's amazing the grandeur of stupidity and evil on display but yet they continue to top themselves every day. Thanks mom, dad, inlaws for voting the Orange Menace into office.    The group, American Accountability Foundation, accused her and other library leaders of promoting children's books with ""radical"" content and literary material authored by Trump opponents.  ""The current #LibrarianOfCongress Carla Hayden is woke, anti-Trump, and promotes trans-ing kids,"" AAF said on its X account earlier Thursday, just hours before the firing was made public.

"Was gonna ask fucking why but   ""The Librarian of Congress serves as the head of the Library of Congress, a presidential appointment confirmed by the Senate for a ten-year term. They oversee the library's vast collections, its administrative functions, and its role in the US copyright system. They also have responsibilities related to fair use provisions, the appointment of the US poet laureate, and the awarding of the Gershwin Prize for Popular Song. ""   I think that part about overseeing the office of US copywrite and AI tech bros frothing for more training material for their AI gives me my answer ",blues111,2025-05-09T06:10:39,12
