For people saying that this is not a win for this admin cause the SCOTUS ordered them a due process must be provided:  This admin will use this as a win and stretch as far as they can and want. It is definitely a win and a huge loss for Americans.,nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-04-07T19:54:38,1

"Justice Jackson ends her dissent with the devastating condemnation of the Court’s use of the shadow docket and the horror of what’s happening-maybe someone else can interpret this at a 3rd grade level for Republicans:  “I lament that the Court appears to have embarked on a new era of procedural variability, and that it has done so in such a casual, inequitable, and, in my view, inappropriate manner. See Department of Education v. California, 604 U. S. _(2025) (JACKSON, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 1-2). At least when the Court went off base in the past, it left a record so posterity could see how it went wrong. See, e.g., Korematsu v. United States, 323 U. S. 214 (1944). With more and more of our most significant rulings taking place in the shadows of our emergency docket, today’s Court leaves less and less of a trace. But make no mistake: We are just as wrong now as we have been in the past, with similarly devastating consequences. It just seems we are now less willing to face it.”",DC_cyber,2025-04-07T19:59:57,1

"Thank god the useless f\*\*\* Biden refused to ""stack the court"" when he was asked to. His first and only attempt at being useful was looking into how to fix the supreme court when he got in and the people who he charged with ideas for that basically said there was no real solution except stacking it and he frowned and refused to do anything. I still stand that he is just as much to blame for the death of our country as republicans because he sat there and did NOTHING along with the democrats in the senate for 4 years and then sabotaged the 2024 election for Democrats by refusing to drop out at a reasonable time.",ValentineLockheart,2025-04-07T19:56:27,1

How exactly could Biden have stacked the court? He only had one vacancy.,Reviews-From-Me,2025-04-07T20:33:50,1
Don't forget that he empowered Garland to do absofucklutely nothing to prosecute Trump for his coup attempt.  If I refuse to do my job then my boss would fire my ass. The conclusion here is that Biden didn't want Garland to go after Trump for whatever reason. My personal guess is that he was afraid that it would set the precedent that all elected officials could be held culpable for crimes and that didn't sit well with both the RNC and the DNC.,red23011,2025-04-07T20:05:20,1

"I meant more that he refused to even entertain the idea and was hardset against even trying it. The democrats consistently have been making fools of themselves for years with childish political stunts (like what they did during trumps stupid congress speech) while refusing to pull meaningful political stunts like publicly raising an outrage and going onto news programs and media to discuss the republicans attempting to destroy democracy by not letting Obama appoint Supreme Court justices during his final year in office. That should have been a cause for borderline political civil war but instead they just shrugged, went “what can you do?”, and acted like it never happened. Then they did nothing while congress pushed through ACB weeks before trump left office with 0 meaningful pushback. We have 2 parties at this point, Nazis and cowardly children. Why do you think Bernie Sanders is getting so much attention and praise right now? It’s because he’s one of the only big names not associated with either failing party",ValentineLockheart,2025-04-07T21:23:35,1
