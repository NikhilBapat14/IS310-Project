"People who do not vote get what the people who did vote voted for.    If they want to be heard, then they need to make noise - real noise. Not just vibe fests at rallies.  Voting is the only thing with teeth.    If people want their interest looked after, then they need to demand it from their politicians. And hold them accountable. Instead of sitting out election after election.    Two statistics:  - about 80% of the country completely ignores primary elections  - we have over 10 times the number of never-voters than always-voters    Not voting isn't helping. We have already accomplished not voting, not participating, not being involved, and not caring.  I think we can say that this plan of inaction has been as much of a success as trickle-down economics.",Rude-Strawberry-6360,2025-05-01T10:21:12,4
"Your theory of the case - and correct me if i’m misunderstanding- is people need to vote and then hold their elected officials accountable. I agree.  However, I think that way of looking at it may be putting the cart before the horse.  The way I see it, politicians need to convince people to vote for them.   I think this idea carries much more power in turning out voters than the idea you put forward.   Trump sure is good at giving people a vision to go out and vote for.   I’m asking again, what in your view, is the vision put forward by democrats over the last ten years that would turn people out to vote?  edit: letter",LongLiveFDR,2025-05-01T10:25:13,0
"I'm actually very tired of this inspiration argument. I have two huge problems with it.    First in the 2016 primaries we had an inspirational candidate in Bernie and I watched as primary after primary result came in and the turnout was anemic. For all the inspiration there was a 25% decrease in the primary turnout. They rallied, they posted, they engaged on social media, they complained  - but they did not vote. Inspiration wasn't enough to get them to the polls. Instead they spout to this day how they were kept from voting by the DNC, not only is this demonstrably false but a cop out.   Nobody stopped them from voting except themselves. And they were inspired. But it didn't help.    Secondly, we are adults. Needing somebody to inspire us to take care of basic responsibilities is an immature and childish position. Do we need the grocery store owner to inspire us to buy vegetables? Do we need the gym owner to inspire us to work out? And further if a person only works out once or twice every 2 to 4 years, or more likely never at all, do you think they will have strong muscles?  Or more likely weak and ineffective?   Civic engagement is a responsibility. At least for Americans. It is built into our constitution and our culture.   ""Of, by and for the people.""   The problem is right now we have a good 40%+ chunk of our population that sees no relationship between the government and their day-to-day lives.",Rude-Strawberry-6360,2025-05-01T10:46:56,4
"Very fair critiques. My rebuttal is that while it may be unfortunate that people are so apathetic to going out to vote, that is the current state of affairs. Further, Trump has proven he is able to inspire people to vote. If democrats can’t do the same, then does it really matter how we feel about whether inspiring people to vote is good or bad?  If the goal is winning, then we should do what is needed to win.  edit:   “ Democracy has disappeared in several other great nations--not because the people of those nations disliked democracy, but because they had grown tired of unemployment and insecurity, of seeing their children hungry while they sat helpless in the face of government confusion and government weakness through lack of leadership in government. Finally, in desperation, they chose to sacrifice liberty in the hope of getting something to eat. We in America know that our own democratic institutions can be preserved and made to work. But in order to preserve them we need to act together, to meet the problems of the Nation boldly, and to prove that the practical operation of democratic government is equal to the task of protecting the security of the people.”  -FDR   https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/fireside-chat-15",LongLiveFDR,2025-05-01T10:55:19,3
"Easy enough. Just get some moderate white basic male.  He'll be elected. We will win but we will continue to have the status quo.    Those are the choices in America today. Put up a basic white guy and have things remain pretty much the same, or get people out to vote and participate actively for actual real change.

Obama was a moderate. He is more centrist than Hillary Clinton. And more centrist than Kamala Harris.    Americans are more centrist than either extreme would have you believe - at least the Americans who vote.   You said you want to win. This is what it takes if people don't bother to vote. We have to put up somebody that will win with the people who do vote. And that is a centrist.,Rude-Strawberry-6360,2025-05-01T11:04:27,2
"Obama was a moderate, 1000%. But did he campaign as a moderate?  Hope and change doesn’t sound too moderate to me.  edit: you say again that you have to be moderate to win. But again, presidential elections don’t show that. The people who win presidential elections promise big change.  edit 2: offering people the ability to go to the doctor when they are sick is not an extreme, it’s widely supported by all americans. offering people a wage so they can feed their family isn’t extreme, it’s widely supported by the american people. The only ones who tell you that centrism is the only way to win are centrists. And they keep losing at the presidential level.

"When I canvassed in 2015 in rural areas i met a lot of people who said they like trump, and bernie. Anecdotal, of course.   I think centrists as a whole tend to overstate how centrist americans are.

"Americans on the whole, how centrist they are is actually debatable.    However, the Americans who do actually vote are more centrist.   If we can't get a good chunk of those 45% never voters to the polls, then we need to run a campaign which will appeal to the Americans who vote.  And that is not a progressive, a liberal, a liberal woman or a woman of color.  We're not far enough out of the dark ages for that.",Rude-Strawberry-6360,2025-05-01T11:35:04,2

"I’m not sure if you are genuinely saying sanders isn’t inspiring or if you’re using the fact that the DNC unfairly put their thumb on the scale as proof he is not inspiring.  I hope everyone notices that centrists will claim all day that progressives aren’t popular because they don’t win. But the same centrists - not necessarily here in this thread but in general- will totally brush off any centrist loses. the centrists could never fathom that their losses are due to their centrist policies being disliked and uninspiring.   To the centrists, they claim progressives losing means voters want centrism. Also to centrists, they claim centrists losing only proves more that people want centrism and that the people aren’t smart or this or that.  Yeah i am able to admit progressives haven’t been winning a whole lot. But neither have centrists. What the progressive response to losing? Doubling down on organizing, doubling down on fighting, and doubling down on offering a bold vision.    What’s the centrist response to losing? blaming voters.

Voters are at fault for the outcome of elections. That’s why we have elections. So that voters can make the decision.   When progressives lose, you blame boogeymen like the DNC.

"I'm not ignoring the lessons and takeaways. The lesson is that America won't elect anything besides a basic white guy. And as long as the nearly 45% who refuse to vote continue not voting, then it better not be anybody seriously controversial. Then the independents will be able to vote for him.   And when he doesn't fix the problems fast enough, then the independents will slink back to the Republicans because they offer the new package of change.    Wash, rinse, repeat.  And as long as the non-voting and uncaring 45% think they are unaffected by politics and they can neglect their civic duty without consequence, then this is the pattern we have.
