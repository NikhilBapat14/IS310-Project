"Given that 58% of Cubans consider themselves Republican, Miami-Dade comes in slightly lower than the general population of Cubans.    MAGA isn't a conservative Republican movement, though - it's reactionary and white supremacist.  Historical membership in the Republican party doesn't count for much if you are a Spanish speaker - they don't consider you to be white, so you've got to go.  My only recommendation to Cubans in this climate is to dye your hair bleach-blonde and take classes to hide any accent you might have so you can ""pass"".",Mindless_Listen7622,2025-05-05T14:44:15,0
