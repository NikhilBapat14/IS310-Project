"Libertarians have these theories about freedom from government. It is especially popular among the super rich like Musk and Bezos, the Uhleins, the Mercers, the Trumps …  They think everything government does is some kind of imposition. They hate regulations and inspectors and taxes. They don’t give any thought to how the system actually protects their wealth. The SEC protects their investments. The county records show where the property lines extend and the courts are our recourse when people violate any of it.  They take all of this for granted and complain about the government and the taxes.  I once had an argument with a co-worker who claimed public libraries are unfair because he doesn’t use them and should not have to pay for them with taxes.  But this kind of thinking is only possible in the cocoon of a republic like the USA which tolerates their nonsense and gives them a hearing.  If we actually went full theoretical libertarian we wouldn’t have a government nor a court system, we wouldn’t have a recourse in disputes. If anyone owed someone money (for example) they could not sue, they would have to hire thugs to collect. It would be a dystopian nightmare.  Society would be like a street without lanes or traffic signals.   This kind of thinking is only possible when we live in a relatively free society where we can be dreamers at our leisure. We can play ‘what if’ and imagine a world free from the abuse of public libraries and fire departments.   They are like fish in a bowl railing about the glass wall which prevents them from going where they want whenever they want.  In the real world if we give up our government someone will impose one on us. If the people said “government is the problem” and “we don’t want a government anymore” some enemy or some superior force would swoop in and give us one worse without our consent.  The problem right now is those idiotic dreamers voted for a con man, and he is ‘giving us’ a government which is much more imposing and abusive than before. If they have any sense they would know that we are heading into arbitrary authoritarianism, which is in no way anything like their dream.",Hesychios,2025-05-06T04:48:28,6

"I'm not sure if ""No True Scotsman"" is the way out of this.  From libertarianism.org  > When ordinary people aren’t careful to respect their neighbors’ privacy, or presume to boss other people about or physically interfere with them, those of us concerned with justice and civility object. We might say: “Stop that. Mind your own business.” But the agents of the state act like the same rules don’t apply to them. Once they decide they want to do a thing, they generally don’t stop to consider whether doing it is any of their business in the first place, or whether they’re going about doing it in a way that disrespects the dignity or autonomy of their fellows. Legislators, bureaucrats, police, and other agents who enforce the state’s commands treat other people as pawns on a chessboard to be maneuvered into whatever configuration they deem best. Too many fail to see people as independent agents with their own desires and plans. That’s true even in relatively free societies.  What this screed fails to cover is _who_ keeps your neighbors out of your business? The rallying cry of ""the state is oppression!!"" is more important than explaining how things _should_ work.  From the libertarian party page:  > Libertarians oppose any government interference in your personal, family, and business decisions. We are here to fight the corruption in our systems, the corruption in our political classes, and remove the barriers they have created to societal, cultural and individual success  Okay.

"Knowingly polluting a river could cause others to become sick, which would violate the NAP. Looking through the lens of libertarianism, that would be against the tenets of the party.  As for _who_ should be keeping your neighbors out of your business, the answer is quite clear. There is a need for enforcement in every civilized country. Even in a home, you'll see this play out. A child steals money from their sibling to buy something they want. Who enforces the rules? A parental figure. But where an authoritarian figure may look to physical reprimands or yelling (is it any wonder why Republicans lean towards spanking as an acceptable punishment?), I think we'd both agree that a more open minded individual would take a less invasive and aggressive approach.  I apply the same mindset to 'the state.' Should we have facial recognition cameras on every corner? No.  Should we try to anticipate _who_ will commit a crime like Palantir seems to be aiming for? No.  Should we still entertain the death penalty? No.  There is a solid case for enforcement but it quickly gets out of hand and unconstitutional. Look at what is happening right now with deportations. Look at what has happened in the last with ICE, the DEA, and ATF. There is always overreach. Does that mean that they are entirely bad? No. But there is no enforcement for the enforcement, and that is dangerous for the liberty of all.  If a right has to be *given,* it is not a right.",Xperian1,2025-05-05T22:15:58,-1
