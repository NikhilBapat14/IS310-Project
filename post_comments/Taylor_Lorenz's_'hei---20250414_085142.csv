Taylor Lorenz herself disgusts everyone.,triggernaut,2025-04-14T09:15:06,33
No different from the same crime against an abortionist. They would justify it as a crime to prevent a greater crime. It's amazing they never think of that.,AppState1981,2025-04-14T14:19:20,5

Everyone deserves a fair trial and legal representation. But she's a scum bag to defend his actions from any level of morality.,JurassicParkFood,2025-04-14T10:22:57,9
Actually I think people on this sub should watch it.  It's a great time capsule of how stupid everything got during Covid Woketopia.,TedriccoJones,2025-04-14T13:35:07,6
