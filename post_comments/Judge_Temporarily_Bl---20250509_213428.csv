"It used to be when these stories came out, the headline would read ""judge blocks."" Now they always add that ""temporarily"" as if it's a given the next judge will reverse the ruling.",backpackwayne,2025-05-09T21:37:18,10

"No, it's temporary as in the order itself is just temporary. It's a two week pause.",FantasticJacket7,2025-05-09T22:34:19,12
"No, itâ€™s because this is one of two kinds of judicial ruling. A judge can permanently block something by making a formal ruling on the decision. Itâ€™s their decision and itâ€™s final. It can be appealed or it can be accepted but the judge is done hearing the case and ruled on it.  Then there are temporary stays, because the judge has not done the full hearing of the case yet but it came across their docket along with the request by the plaintiffs to temporarily pause any action from being taken by the defendant until the judge is done hearing the case because itâ€™s time sensitive. In those scenarios the judge makes a temporary block basically saying â€œpause everything, do nothing, until Iâ€™ve heard the case and made a final decisionâ€œ. This usually happens when the defendant is trying to do something that will take place in the next couple of hours/days/weeks, on a faster timeline and the judge would be able to hear all the information and make a final ruling. Itâ€™s also significantly more likely for the grant a temporary stay on the surface level it looks to the judge like thereâ€™s very reasonable odds that the plaintiff will prevail.   Judges either accept the plaintiffs argument for a temporary stay, or sometimes they deny a temporary stay and continue on with the case otherwise.",sargonas,2025-05-10T00:26:01,4
"TROs and temporary blocks or injunctions are generally only granted when there's some combination of a) person seeking said relief is very likely to prevail in a full trial, and/or b) irreparable or irreversible change/harm would be certain during the course of the trial just based on how long trials take.   Here is an EXCELLENT article that goes into all the details:  https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/temporary-blocks--what-you-need-to-know-about-tros-and-preliminary-injunctions",sp0rkah0lic,2025-05-09T23:31:36,2
