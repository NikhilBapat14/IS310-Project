"I think there's some truth to it, but it's not 100% true. Sinema got kicked out of the party for her showboating villainy, for instance. And it's **definitely** not what happened here. Democrats are openly calling for Schumer's replacement in leadership, and that's a bit too much heat to be fake (plus there was a screaming match in senate discussions that would have to be acted, which I think is implausible).   [Per AOC](https://bsky.app/profile/aoc.bsky.social/post/3lkeqn7u7u22c), there was an ""agreed-upon plan"" that Schumer broke. If I'm guessing, based on reporting, is what happened here is:  1. Schumer thinks ""There's no way House Republicans can pass a CR with only one defection, so if House Democrats all vote no that it'll fail and we can blame the Republicans."" 2. Some House Democrats are like ""I'm in a swing district and this is a tough vote for me. What happens if they do pass it?"" 3. Schumer tells them that if it passes in the House, Senate Democrats will block it and stand united, but he doesn't expect to be called on it. 4. House Republicans manage to pass a CR with only one defection. Schumer's like ""Fuck"". 5. Schumer flip-flops at the last second. House Democrats are legitimately shocked and outraged, to the point that centrists Democrats are giving AOC money to run a primary challenge against Schumer (that'd be in 2028) 6. Senate Democratic meeting turns into a shouting match so loud people outside the room can quote Gillibrand directly, with Senate Leadership trying to get Senate Democrats to vote yes  I don't know how much convincing the yes Democrats needed, or how many ""no"" Democrats are happy there's no shutdown, but I'd think more than half of Senate democrats are mad there's no shutdown and nearly all of them think Schumer fucked this up.",Chiponyasu,2025-03-15T10:57:18,55
"But they primaried Liberman. He then beat the Democrat to take seat as an independent.  So what could have been done differently to deal with the Liberman problem?

"It doesn't need to be appointed or coordinated tricky much to actually happen. You talk with your colleagues, you know X is going to vote so and so and you know the bill is doomed, so you vote the most politically opportune way. That the one dooming the bill is the one who has no ducks to give, is obvious - all others are ""hiding"" behind him. I doubt any vote isn't already 99% clear how it will go beforehand.

"I don’t think what happened here was the result of the “rotating villain” but rather the Democratic Party (particularly the Senate) is lost right now and doesn’t have a plan. It’s pretty clear that Senate Dems are pretty rudderless and that Schumer has virtually no political capital within the party. Schumer was a relatively weak Senate leader when he was in the majority, and he’s now a minority leader on top of that, so he can’t command the respect necessary to whip votes on bills like this. So what you get is every man/woman for themselves, not following the lead of the party but making decisions based on their own self interest or their own delusions about the process.   I don’t think they really even thought this out. It seems like they were betting pretty hard on the House not being able to get the CR passed, which would have resulted in a shutdown being triggered before the bill even got to the Senate. If the House failed to pass the CR then Senate Dems would likely have been able to drive a much tougher bargain to end the shutdown. Obviously that didn’t happen, and Senate Dems were caught with their pants down when they had just days to decide whether to fight or cave.",permanent_goldfish,2025-03-14T22:56:11,56

There's no rotating villain. I don't doubt for a second that there were strategic mechanisms in play to ensure that certain Democratic Senators would be shielded from a yes vote and that the bulk of the opposition would come from the House Democrats, but that's just strategic politics.",ClockOfTheLongNow,2025-03-15T08:25:41,14

"Given the various congressional makeups over the last several years, Democrats can only be as progressive as the most conservative Democrat in the caucus. They can't create majorities in Congress without conservative Democrats, so therefore, conservative Democrats are going to have a lot more leverage than others. There's no big conspiracy here, it's just about the way things are in America - if the Democrats want majorities, they have to appeal to conservatives, at least a small amount",AntarcticScaleWorm,2025-03-15T03:42:16,6
"Manchin was the last statewide Democratic elected official in a state that had shifted from Dixiecrat to Republican.  He was trying to play on his ability to win in spite of the odds by positioning himself as someone who could follow his own path.  Sinema won her seat in part by appealing to moderate Republicans and Dems.  Unlike West Virginia that has been moving into the dark red column, Arizona has been shifting purple to light blue.  Unlike Manchin who had decades in West Virginia politics, Sinema did not have much of a legacy. She was trying to find a way to split the difference and lost.  Progressives need to dump these dim conspiracy theories.  All politics are ultimately local.  That does not mean that every politician makes the right choice or has good odds of success.  The Democratic inclination to either go high or else get shrill does not help.  Neither tactic works.",I405CA,2025-03-15T14:08:42,7

"I think the issue is more that the Democratic party is a lot more diverse (in terms of politics) than the Republicans are, so it's harder to get all the senators/representatives to agree on things. In contrast, it's much easier to get the GOP to all be on the same page because they're more closely aligned to begin with.

"Thomas Massie is one of the only Congress members in either house to turn down an assigned AIPAC handler.  Not only is no money being funneled to him from Israel, but they have stated their intent to fund his primary opponent.  Any member of Congress that threatens to stop or slow the flow of money to Israel to wage its war, or to expose their money schemes, gets primaried.  It's actually somewhat telling that the far left and the far right agree on this point, but the moderates don't feel pressured because the ones calling it out can be dismissed as extreme or fringe.",trigrhappy,2025-03-15T07:12:13,3
"This sounds like a conspiracy theory that came straight out of the Kremlin or Fox News.   Machin represented a state that Democrats had no business winning and he had financial interests in his state. We know why he voted the way he did.   Sinema campaigned as a moderate, the far left has a revisionist history of her campaign because she was a cool bisexual woman. As she was in the Senate, we know she was also teaching at à local university on how to fundraise for political campaigns. She was always a swamp creature.   Lieberman also switched parties for a long time after that.   Democrats want to pass progressive legislation. Your conspiracy theory is so insanely toxic and blatantly false for obvious reasons. There is zero logical reasons why Democrats would not want to pass progressive populist legislation. This is a conspiracy theory straight from Bernie Sanders dirty campaign he ran in 2016,  that was entirely based on poisoning the well of the Democratic party. That one false narrative could have single handedly elected Trump in 2016. The far left that promotes it just can't accept that their sweeping conspiracy theories and narratives they believe to rationalize their helplessness are false.

"AOC and Bernie want a pointless fight because they're purists, Schumer understands that a government shutdown is bad for everyone and allowing it to go ahead will result in the Dems being *correctly* blamed for it.  Democrats have also been consistently against shutdowns in the past and if that position is going to have credibility in the future you can't go back on it now.  *Never interrupt your enemy whilst they're making a mistake* is a foundational principle in politics. Trump and Musk are making mistakes all over the place, and it's becoming obvious even to Republican voters. All a shutdown will achieve is interrupting that narrative, and giving Musk and Trump political cover for the problems they are creating.  Everyone will be upset by this, but it's the truth.  >rotating villain theory  Pfft. Politically, this was going through anyway, mainly because you also can't be publicly against shutdowns and firing federal workers and then be partly responsible for furloughing everyone. The optics are just bad because it's using federal workers as pawns. Even if the shutdown went ahead, you're going to have a few days of public mudslinging before you make a deal which looks like the CR anyway.   So you look at your caucus and see who politically needs to vote against this to avoid hurting their reelection chances, and they get shoved to the front.   The leadership understands that Bluedogs like Manchin and Sinema have a character to play, and playing that character helps both parties.

"I think that's a bit simplistic. The expression ""politics makes strange bedfellows"" has always been true. There are many influences that cause various members of Congress vote the way they do. That's largely because the political considerations for each member are different.

"No, based on the House Democrats' reaction they genuinely did not expect this one to go the way it did. The problem was as follows, they could:  1.  Pass the CR, and ensure the government is funded through September 30th. However, doing this funds DOGE and DHS' deportation programs, which are both hot button issues for Progressive voters that Democrats would really like to have turn out for several off-year elections this year (like the Wisconsin Supreme Court seat that will tip the balance of redistricting in the state). Or,  2. Block cloture in the Senate, and induce a shutdown. In other administrations this may have worked, **however**, those administrations did not have Russ Vought as the OMB Director. Russ Vought curiously enough is the author of the parts of Project 2025 that discussed both how to reduce the size of government and then how to ensure it doesn't grow back. Based on the House's recess schedule, a shutdown would have meant Vought would have had at least a 12 day Demolition Derby to lay off staff and shutter departments. Likewise, the DOGE staff could have been declared ""essential"" by the OMB director and kept on their current tasks (though waiting for pay until after the shutdown). Same for DHS/ICE.  So behind door number 1 you have annoyed progressive voters and continued DOGE work, and continued Deportations, and behind door number 2 you have annoyed progressive voters, continued DOGE work, continued Deportations, and a nearly two week metaphorical killdozer rampage through the executive branch on top of all of that.   As a side bonus, there's no reason you can't keep National Parks, Monuments, and museums like the Smithsonian open during a shutdown; nor do Social Security checks stop; nor does Medicare nor Medicaid. A prolonged shutdown with no obvious effects to most people nationwide might have broken the mystique of government shutdowns.  Initially it looked like the Democrats' leadership thought a shutdown was a better option, until their members reminded them that the nature of the current OMB would make a shutdown worse.",255-0-0-i,2025-03-15T19:05:48,1

"Say whatever you may or want to about GOP Rep. Thomas Massie (KY-04), but he's one of the most earnest, sincere, genuine, authentic, and ideologically consistent members of Congress -- certainly ever since Justin Amash is no longer in D.C. -- pulling no punches, even when it involves internecine intraparty infighting.  Speaking of intraparty infighting, I'm surprised Trump didn't incentivize Massie by offering him a spot in his Cabinet as Secretary of Agriculture, since it'd get him out of the House -- where he, unlike Chip Roy, Scott Perry, or Jim Jordan, is no pushover -- and thus, in turn, no longer a thorn poking deep in the side of Speaker Mike Johnson, who snippily and snipingly removed Massie from the Rules Committee.

"Chuck Schumer is being heavily criticized, but he's actually right. The Democrats allowing this bill to pass is actually the lesser of the two evils.  Capitulating here is bad, but the alternative is in fact worse.  During a government shutdown, DOGE would have even greater ability to force through its cuts.  The reality is that the Democrats were cooked the moment this bill passed the House unaltered (due to the House Freedom Caucus getting on board when they didn't in the past).  The Democrats have no leverage when the Republicans are united.  That's what happens when you're in the minority in both houses of Congress as well as the White House.  The difference in Trump's second term so far is that the Republican factions are not split, as they were in his first term.  Had the Republicans been united in Trump's first term, a lot more would have gotten done (an even more nightmarish situation than his first term already was).  My only question (which we'll never know) is who voters would have blamed if the government shut down, the Republicans or the Democrats.  Buckle up...this ride is only getting started.

Because Mark Cuban was key surrogate for Kamala, and he sells for a living. Bartender to billionaire.  >Nice buzzwords, mind defining what goalposts I shifted?   Sure you read a cogent argument you didn't like and attempted to reframe it, thereby shifting the goalposts from the actual argument to the one you wanted to make. I doesn't surprise that you're unfamiliar with key logical fallacies.  >Because democratic leadership is full of dipshits who don't FIGHT. They run to the gop framing of issues and lose.   It's almost as if you don't grasp the thinking of key blocs of voters needed to win an election and seem to think they should agree with you because you're right and they're not.  Perhaps, call me crazy, all voters don't agree with you.  >Kamala ran around with Liz Cheney and talked about stricter boarder control.   Immigration and getting moderate Conservative to turn out for Kamala being presumably unimportant. It's not like those votes were the difference between winning and losing.

"My position has been the same the whole time. You are simply incapable of responding to it, so you pretend that I have a different one. None of what is happening here is some secret conspiracy. It’s all completely standard political behavior. It is legal and above board. It is business as usual. You need me to be a crazy conspiracy theorist because you have no arguments against my actual position, and no capacity to engage with what I am actually telling you. Citizens United is not a conspiracy. Lobbying is not a conspiracy. Politicians, including Democrats, act in the interests of the people that fund their campaigns. That’s why those people fund their campaigns in the first place. That is how the American political system functions at its most basic level. It’s not an evil plot, it’s just politics.",Past_Hat177,2025-03-15T15:05:43,1

I know you can't be reasoned with so I won't go back and quote you, but your far left conspiracy theorist peer was using the existence of campaign contributions to mean that all Democrats including AOC and Sanders can all be blackmailed so that is why they are keeping this conspiracy theory a secret(the one OP is asking about).

"No...

"I worked for the Democrats for two years. My boss was a former lobbyist, and specifically left, taking a substantial pay cut, because he couldn’t accept being a part of that system. My knowledge and beliefs about the American political system come directly from his experiences and my own. I know exactly what I’m talking about because I fucking lived it.    Your entire belief system is based on half remembered talking points and a desperate need to see the Democrats as salvation from this mess. I hate to break that illusion for you, but it has to be done. The American political system is fundamentally intertwined with the interests of wealthy donors.

"You have made two arguments against me. First, and the one you kept repeating over and over, is that a conspiracy made up of thousands of people would be extremely difficult to keep covered up. This is a terrible argument because I never alleged a conspiracy that needed to be covered up. Strawman fallacy, and ill-constructed at that.   Second is the assertion that every donation by corporate interests to politicians is to “help them write highly specialized legislation.” This is such an absurd argument that I wanted to ignore it for your benefit. Everyone, even the politicians themselves, admit that money in politics is a problem.  “The fact is we all should be working to overturn Citizens United and reduce the role of money in politics.” -Nancy Pelosi  Do you know what that thing above is? It’s called a quote. It’s something that can be used as evidence to support a claim. An alternative solution would be links to sources. I thought I should let you know, since you haven’t been using any of them. You have made barely any arguments, your main one is a fallacy, and the rest are completely unsupported by any logical reasoning or evidence.   Now that you’ve had your face rubbed in by the fact that I have first-hand experience with what we’re talking about and am fundamentally more knowledgeable on the subject, you switched your ad hominem attacks to me being bad at argumentation. I know you don’t actually care about logical argumentation, and your reason for bringing it up is just more ad hominem, but let’s pretend for a moment.   You’ve written like half a dozen comments to me at this point. Your job is to find and quote a single segment of one of your comments that is a genuine counter argument to the actual positions I hold, is logically sound, and is supported by evidence. No strawmans, no ad hominems. I don’t think you can find one, because I don’t think you have written a single, genuine, logical counter-argument to my position. You can’t attack me for failing to respond to counter arguments that you haven’t written.   You have an emotional need to see yourself as this rational and logically minded individual defending truth against a brainwashed and irrational conspiracy theorist. But it’s just a fantasy. Your comments are illogical and unsupported by evidence, and I am a former professional in the field we are arguing about, with first-hand knowledge of this subject. As a result, you’re breaking down as the illusion breaks down. But please, if you think I’ve misjudged your comments, do as I said and quote one of them that has an argument you want me to respond to. If you can find one that isn’t a straw man or ad hominem, I will take it seriously and respond to it with logic, evidence, and my professional expertise.",Past_Hat177,2025-03-15T21:16:33,1
