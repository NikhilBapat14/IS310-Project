Ultimately I think Trump is willing to moderate his position but I have no doubt his ego has taken a hit that these tariffs are being universally pushed back on. Hopefully Navarro is locked away in some broom closet and someone is finally telling Trump it will take a decade to reshore the industries he thinks are going to start constructing factories tomorrow.   I would like to deals with some of these 100+ countries to bring a little stability and consistency into the market.,EliteJassassin101,2025-04-13T22:35:05,297

">*They‚Äôre exempt from the reciprocal tariffs, but they‚Äôre included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two*  My feet are kicked up while people are spamming the 1 or 10 button on IMDB.

"I think he needs to just go through with it and deal with whatever results the economy. The left and fellow conservatives already hate him regardless of which way he goes now, there's no reason to prolong the conniption.",kappacop,2025-04-13T19:59:45,-253
"I recommend everyone go watch some of the recent YouTube videos (or listen in podcast form) from Nick Freitas. There‚Äôs some really good explanation of what might be going on here. The extremely short version is that it seems likely that this is about bringing manufacturing back to the US, not about reciprocity of tariffs, and the whole situation is attempting to stop or at least mitigate a massive depression stemming from 50 years of negative trade balances. It‚Äôs both compelling and terrifying as discussions go but the worst part is that is that makes a ton of sense and is backed up by data and existing economic theory and principles.",deadzip10,2025-04-14T06:48:43,-62

I don‚Äôt like tariffs but I would almost rather see Trump commit to them than this flip flopping crap. At least that‚Äôs real policy with an end goal in mind instead of blowing up the stock market every other day for no good reason,Germy_1114,2025-04-14T07:31:15,61
"Trump has gut instincts about a lot of stuff, and that's generally how he governs. That's my theory.   So he has a gut instinct that illegal immigration is a problem. Entering the country illegally has to be stopped, and committing further crimes while already inside illegally is even worse.   And that's a pretty popular gut instinct.   He also has the gut instinct that trade deficits are bad.   This might be a *common* gut instinct... But it's just plain old wrong. There's no other way to say it.   I mean, how on God's green earth is the trade balance between the US and Vietnam ever going to be equal?  Vietnamese people earn like about 3000 bucks a year. They have no money to buy F150s and computer software!  Which is what the US sells!  When someone purchases something, they do it because they already think they're getting a good deal. I want a t shirt, and I see one on sale for 10 bucks, good deal, I buy it.   I don't then also want to sell 10 bucks worth of stuff back to Walmart to somehow make things fair...  Well I'm sorry, but ""trade deficit"" talk is *exactly* as stupid sounding as trying to sell stuff back to Walmart so you don't have a trade deficit with them.",Trussed_Up,2025-04-13T22:18:47,749

"Yeah he inherently thinks in his core that tariffs are good. Fine. Set it in stone. Dont do this daily back and forth - tariffs, no tariffs, pause tariffs, tariff exemptions for tech, no tariff expemtions for tech. What are the tariffs for? Trade deficit, eliminate the income tax, punish china, negotiations. No one rrally knows cause they dont know themselves. Theyre just winging it and playing with other peoples 401k and savings.  This can all be fixed by a functioning congress but theyre too busy writing bills on putting trump on mount rushmore.",happykim,2025-04-13T22:27:40,388
"Are we not an economy of consumers with expendable income? This reality would naturally result in a trade imbalance between us and other countries.  Tariffs should be used to force other countries to eliminate artificial trade barriers created by their governments. From there, let the free market decide on trade balance.",purplebasterd,2025-04-14T05:27:46,88
