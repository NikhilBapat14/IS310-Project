Super bummed about Florida. Hoping Wisconsin will be the nice ending after Cory Booker’s amazing 24 hours.,Penelope_Pitstop25,2025-04-01T19:26:50,3

Shout out to Wisconsin! Elon tried hard to buy that vote,Penelope_Pitstop25,2025-04-01T22:07:15,1

They are saying they’ve run out of ballots in WI. I hope that’s a good sign… and that nobody leaves.,Penelope_Pitstop25,2025-04-01T19:55:25,3
