"The thing that infuriated me the most is when liberals said we were murderers for wanting to go to church or our mother's funeral. But destroying the country by hundreds of thousands of people was totally fine. An over 100,000 person protest in New York City was totally okayed at the height of the pandemic by Fauci. That is what I am continuously infuriated about.",BossJackson222,2025-04-14T13:21:27,169
"This is a prime example of where RFK should be focusing.  mRNA-based vaccines are the wave of the future, if bird flu jumps to humans in a significant way, this technology will most likely be used as the basis for vaccines.  Longitudinal studies need to be funded to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mRNA.",SeemoarAlpha,2025-04-14T14:14:07,41

"I had Pfizer for my first shot, within a day or two I got a numb left side of my face and it lasted for 2 weeks or so. There was even a little bit of paralysis I think because I was biting my lip multiple times a day during the whole thing. Unfortunately, it comes back every time I get sick, and for the first year or two, it seemed like every month I was getting sick. At least when it comes back it's just my left ear feeling weird now instead of the whole left side of my face.  Oh and shortly after the shot my keratosis pillaris extended from my arms to my neck and back after it had stayed at my arms for 30+ years.  Pretty cool that I can't sue at all and even if I can at some point, will be hard to substantiate or prove by then. I found out many had my reaction and were around forums for neurologists and even their specialist docs were basically saying they didn't know. This was also in 2021 so a lot of their docs were probably very hesistant to relate it to the vaccine.  Yeah, wish I had just went with J&J... or heck, rather I could have had the means to say F U to my job and just not gotten the shot. I don't mind most vaccines, it just didn't seem like this one was worth the risk vs reward from the data I was seeing and the rapidly mutating nature of the virus, turned out I was super right on that one.",brucekeller,2025-04-14T16:08:57,10
I really hope we see some justice and help for this soon. It can be completely life ruining when it's severe. I am living it.,kaytin911,2025-04-14T13:16:58,13
This also happened with the swine flu vaccine. Some people got autoimmune disease that ruined their lives. Hence why I didn't get the vaccine and just decided to stay home.,ZoroastrianCaliph,2025-04-14T16:22:29,4

I truly believe that had it not been for the vaccine mandate Roe v. Wade would have never been repealed.  Can't claim medical autonomy exists when it comes to killing babies but doesn't apply to medical procedures that had a poor benefit/risk ratio for most people.,Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-04-14T15:58:00,19

"I didn't get the vax and went out on my job anyway. (It helps that I'm self-employed.) My job was also deemed ""critical.""  On the rare occasion I was asked about my vax status, I just said ""I'm good"" and let my clients come to their own conclusions. I did stay home if I was sick, of course.",Swiftbow1,2025-04-14T23:10:05,0
"Doesn't really work that way, unfortunately. The vaccine itself is no longer in your body. The effects of what it did remain, but it's not like you have a fluidic vax that continually runs through you. The mRNA alters the genes of the cells it comes into contact with and changes those cells (much like how viruses do).   You could theoretically take ANOTHER mRNA shot that would attempt to reverse the effects, but it's unpredictable which cells it would actually target. Which is the main reason the original shot often malfuctioned... it inserted the spike protein into the wrong target cells. This is what caused the myocardistis... heart cells with the spike protein didn't operate properly and caused damage to the heart valves. The shot wasn't SUPPOSED to target heart cells, but it was operating freely in the bloodstream for several days after the shot, and thus could accidentally target cells it came into contact with.  The spike protein also didn't behave the way it was supposed to even when the shot worked as intended. It added a spike protein to cells that was supposed to teach the immune system to target those proteins. Instead (in some cases) the body decided that cells with that spike protein were SUPPOSED to be there.  That's what resulted in a lot of the autoimmune disorders. Because the immune system thought the spike protein was part of the human body, it ignores the ACTUAL virus, which lingers and lingers and lingers.",Swiftbow1,2025-04-14T23:01:55,1

"Don't forget about all the people who were vaccinated against their will due to fears of losing their jobs.  If someone chooses to hold out their arm and cross their fingers that is up to them.  However, the right of informed consent and medical autonomy shouldn't be stripped by bureaucrats.  Due to the way vaccine damages laws are setup there wouldn't be much legal recourse to the manufacturers.  Employers?  That is another story.",Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-04-14T16:01:52,21
