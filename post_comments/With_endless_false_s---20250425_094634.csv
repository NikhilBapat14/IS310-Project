"Here is the thing. . .  Every one here is politically plugged in. So you are exposed to the deluge of bullshit.  Steve Bannon even said this as a strategy - 'flood the zone with shit'  And you know what? It Worked.  The politicos sieze upon everything - and the average person igonores everything because of life and bills and whatnot. They might catch abglipse of something on Fox news or Facebook about the thousands of trans athletes or the waves of illegal immigrants and think 'at least Trump is fighting the good fight' - and then they're back to their lives.  Uninformed voters rule this country. The uninformed are easy prey to propaganda.  So, what can be done??  You get people engaged. Persistently and consistently.  You ignore the trivium. Trump said something uncouth norntold a small lie?  Ignore it.  Focus on the big problems  Like how the tariffs are totally without planning and causing economic havok  Like how the Sec Def is literally a national security risk  Like how LEGAL residents can be sent to a foreign country with NO DUE PROCESS  . . .  People will question the big things.  Ignore the small stuff and hammer him on what matters.",neosituation_unknown,2025-04-25T21:37:12,229

"You do like Xi. You ignore the guy and you move on, silently to divest and trade with other countries.  A leader like trump will not build anything or develop a country.

"In my view it is a matter of credibility. Trump has none, he has nurtured a deep lack of credibility and lies constantly. Therefore anything he says can be assume false, exaggerate or imaginary. His regime is also filled with nakedly dumb fabulists as well though there is still some truth to those statements so I give them a 20% truth value. Still mostly false but maybe they could be saying the truth.   As it pains me to say this. The Chinese Foreign/Trade Ministry is far more reliable and therefore will believe their statements before anything from the Trump regime.   So, I accept that everything from the current US government is suspect and probably false until triple verified. On a day to day basis I need to make sure I’m not reading The Onion, but we (as a nation) have been here before. Now, their fascist paramilitary and gestapo tactics. That’s new and very distressing.

"It is surreal that in 2025 we are still treating Trump like a credible source while the man treats facts like a suggestion. Every crisis, every negotiation, every speech somehow centers around a warped version of reality he invents on the fly. The real danger is not just the lies themselves, but how they erode public trust, damage alliances, and poison rational debate. You cannot negotiate, legislate, or lead when reality is constantly shifting based on the whims of one man. A functioning democracy depends on truth being a shared foundation. When leaders tear that apart for ego or politics, it destabilizes everything. The world already knows to take China’s propaganda with skepticism , now they are learning they must treat Trump’s words the same way. This is not just embarrassing. It is actively dangerous.

"America has always had an anti-intellectualism problem,  Richard Hofstadter won a Pulitzer price in 1964 writing about this issue.   Many bad actors through the years have taken advantage of this problem, and in the 90's we saw the rise of a full blown propaganda network (Fox News) that created a media behemoth by catering to the anti intellectual crowd.   The internet and social media accelerated this problem and allowed Bad State actors such as Russia to influence things by flooding the internet with misinformation and pandering to emotions. Throw in people like Joe Rogan and the problem became even worse.   Trump is the end result of decades of anti-intellectualism mixed with manipulative media operations designed to draw in single issue voters, evangelicals, low information voters and the anti-intellectual portion of the electorate.    He is a symptom, not the whole problem. And I am am honestly not quite sure how we solve it, as I anticipate that polarization will continue to worsen.

"The question should be one of how you weaken him.  On the home front, that involves attacking his brand in a way that resonates with at least some of his supporters.  Abroad, that requires allies to see what he wants, then working to give him the exact opposite.  At home, the lukewarm supporters of Trump thought that he was competent, business-savvy and tough.  Fortunately, a miracle has happened and the message about Trump has begun to swing around to attacking his ineptitude and weakness.  Approval ratings are now falling as a result, as confidence has been shaken and chaos becomes a turnoff to the center and apolitical.  Turn enough public sentiment against him, and Republicans who are worried about losing in 2026 will become more willing to stand up to him, albeit on Republican terms.  They will prioritize their reeelection chances over the party or its leader if forced to choose.  Trump's idea of international relations is bullying allies (as he perceives them as being weak) and turning everything into a unilateral negotiation (since he is playing divide and conquer).  Stand up to him and unite against him, and his tactics begin to fall apart.  Stop focusing on the lies and threats to democracy.  Those tend not to resonate with the public and can actually turn them off as it can sound like Chicken Little.  Dems need to remember that they have 20 seconds to sell a message and the incompetence / weakness / failure angle should be the priority.  So there isn't much time for anything else.

This is just something Democrats say now in addition to accusing all of their opponents with being racist, sexist, homophobic, etc. or insisting everything they do is unconstitutional.  Democrats have just made these words completely meaningless.   That’s not to say that Trump isn’t frequently incorrect but being wrong is different from lying.  I do find it frustrating that you can’t just assume everything Trump says is 100% factually correct but I find those mistakes rarely matter to the overall point.   For example, I watched the Biden/Trump debate on CNN.  The network obviously had to go into crisis mode to deflect and chose to focus on Trump “lying” through the whole debate.  They cited one lie as especially egregious where he claimed taxes were at their lowest for Americans during his first term.  They were able to prove that 100 years ago taxes were very slightly lower for a very brief period of time.  That was their “Lie of the Night”.  In reality, Trump made a very minor error that in no way disputed the real point he was making about how exceptionally low taxes were under him but Democrats ran with it in crisis mode to distract from the *real* lie of the night which was, of course, the fact that those pointing out Joe Biden’s mental decline were conspiracy theorists, that he runs circles mentally and physically around staffers half his age, and just had a cold.",-Boston-Terrier-,2025-04-25T22:31:23,-13

"I don’t necessarily disagree, but a lot of what gets labeled “small stuff” isn’t small to the people it directly affects.  Take attacks on trans athletes. On paper, it impacts a tiny number of people. But it’s not really about sports. It’s part of a broader effort to normalize hostility toward trans and, by extension, all LGBT people. That affects a lot more people - trans people, their friends, their family.  Even if someone’s not an athlete, this kind of constant targeting creates a hostile environment. It legitimizes hate, and that has real consequences. Sometimes violently real.  People can’t just ignore it. Because once the outrage moves on from trans athletes, it’ll find the next target. And the next. And the next. That’s the whole strategy.  The folks at the top pushing these issues don't actually care about them. They just want us distracted and emotionally drained so we’re not focusing on the stuff that actually threatens what they do care about.  Immigration is really no different. ""Illegal"" immigrants are one thing, but we see it particularly even lately that far more people are getting swept up into it than that. Everyone with a non-white skin color or an accent has a reason to be living in a constant, even if only low level, state of fear. That does things to people. It creates trauma.  So it’s not about ignoring the “small stuff.” It’s about learning to fight it in a way that doesn’t burn us out or let it consume all our attention.

"I just told you that Trump frequently says things that are factual incorrect. In both cases he cited viral news stories that were fake. Neither error took away from the overall point though even if you’re far too partisan to acknowledge it.   I don’t remember which city he was referring to but while you’re hyper focused on that stupid eating cats and dogs story, the city’s population jumped something like 25% in a matter of months as the Biden Administration started bringing in migrants. Nobody was eating cats and dogs but increasing a city’s population that much has very real consequences. Housing prices go up, jobs become scarce and wages drop with cheap immigrant labor, classrooms become overcrowded, wait times increase in hospitals, etc. and it lead to very real conflict between the immigrant population and those who lived there before Biden’s lax immigration policies. Trump made all of these points and they’re all true but you choose to focus on the factually incorrect things he said that’s largely irrelevant to the overall point point for partisan reasons.   Windmills don’t cause cancer but they don’t generate nearly enough electricity to be a serious replacement for oil. More importantly, even if they did, nobody wants to live near them.

"Did you even comprehend what you wrote? Basically you're saying  >Yes we've had decades of illegal immigration. Now it's still present but not as high as it was in 2006 so I don't see the problem. 🙂  Immigration is an issue to many voters. It's literally one of the biggest voter issues in the West. Europe is taking a far-right direction because of it. Notably, in Germany, the xenophobic AfD was polling in 1st place. They were slowly rising in the polls and were seen as never getting so far. The AfD is the closest thing to the NSDAP that the notorious mustachioed Austrian led.  You can write manufactured all you want and it won't change a thing. That same thinking is why Western Gen-Z men are more conservative than their Millenial and Gen-X counterparts, and look up to men like Andrew Tate.   It was believed that the chauvinistic and misogynistic mentality would mostly go away with the Boomers but now you have part of a whole new young generation of men that think like that. And with the movement to wrestle away control from the institutions in order to give more control to parents (and right-wingers), these men will teach their sons this thinking with little opposition.   Maybe in a hundred years, they'll look back at this and say _this is why you tackle the voter's issues immediately instead of letting it snowball over the decades._ The AfD in Germany was unthinkable 10+ years ago. And it began with people raising concerns of illegal migrants. The authorities and media called them racists and continued on the same course as the racist card worked well. Now there's apathy so the racist card doesn't work with the Germans. **NOW** the political parties are trying to tackle illegal immigration but it's too late.  Remember Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.

"> Yes we've had decades of illegal immigration. Now it's still present but not as high as it was in 2006 so I don't see the problem.  Not quite. I'm saying that the **number** of illegal immigrants in the US today is a bit lower than it was in 2006. If you ask 100 people, 99 will tell you that this number is ""much higher"". People are operating on false facts which are being centrally pushed by anti-immigrant groups like the Center for Immigration Studies.  People are responding to false propaganda being deliberately fed to them on social media. Everyone would oppose immigrants kidnapping dogs and cats and eating them. That's ""common sense"". But it isn't happening. That lie is spreading because the people spreading it hate immigrants, and want others to hate them too. And that is largely working - to the detriment of the US, because the US being a welcoming place to immigrants is what sets us apart from other countries, and contributes to what people refer to as ""American exceptionalism"".",MoonBatsRule,2025-04-29T09:59:46,1
"> it’s the ones who drank their own kool-aid and think god signed their memo.  Fair.  (Edit) But if you really believe what you say, is it actually lying when you say it? Isn't that just being wrong?  > you think trump’s the first lunatic to steer an empire off the rails?  _An_ empire? No. The US? Yes. We're not talking about ancient Rome and its leaded wine, here.  > you’re still caught in that old comforting story where if we just elect someone slightly more ""sane"" the ship rights itself.  Nowhere have I implied that, but since you bring it up, yes, a sane administration would be preferred by literally everyone. I don't know why you think that wouldn't be an improvement. I guess because you're hung up on conflating sanity with honesty?  And since it seems to bear reiteration, I'm not approving of politicians who habitually lie and manipulate the public. My initial comment was the observation that the public at large already does that regardless of my personal feelings on the matter, and my second comment was trying to to point out that a demand for absolute honesty is unreasonable, not because it's undesirable, but because it's literally impossible whenever you have more than one human in a room. Call that naive if you like, then go read some research papers on how humans interact with each other in real life. Or just interact with some humans in real life.  The end point remains the same: Trump is a step or three removed from common liars. He lives in his own reality. He ""drank his own kool-aid,"" to borrow your expression, and moreover drinks different kool-aid every single day.    ETA: I should pick a different expression, really, because ""drinking the kool-aid"" implies some kind of conviction in a set of beliefs; I don't think Trump has any convictions apart from his own magnificence. That gets back to my first comment, where I said that most lies from leadership are serving some goal that they and the public both accept the legitimacy of even if they disagree on whether it's desirable. Trump doesn't do that. He's completely disordered.",Delta-9-,2025-04-26T12:24:47,3

">Not quite. I'm saying that the **number** of illegal immigrants in the US today is a bit lower than it was in 2006.   But are you talking about the numbers coming in each year like in your previous post or are you talking about the numbers currently present in the US? For the latter, it ranges from 11 to 16 million people.  >Everyone would oppose immigrants kidnapping dogs and cats and eating them. That's ""common sense"". But it isn't happening.  Only the MAGA camp believe it mostly.   >And that is largely working - to the detriment of the US, because the US being a welcoming place to immigrants is what sets us apart from other countries, and contributes to what people refer to as ""American exceptionalism"".  That is debatable. When it comes to the economy, you need a large workforce so immigration makes sense when the domestic population doesn't have enough kids. American women are having kids in their 30s now. Plus the economy and labor laws aren't ideal, so you need to put off having kids since the cost of living is high that the 2.1 replacement rate isn't feasible. We definitely need a reform system. I think we are only one of a few countries that is looser on who they let in. The Europeans let in refugees (legitimate or not) and skilled talent that is hard to find domestically. We let illegal immigrants in, sometimes give them a court case far off into the future, they have American kids by that point, and now it's immoral to remove them because you break up families. And the advocates know this. Some get court cases early and are removed but the others stay.",nigel_pow,2025-04-29T10:40:50,1

""saner"" leadership sounds nice on paper but in practice...sanity gets eaten alive by the incentives baked into the empire itself. doesn’t matter how smart or ethical someone starts out...the machine grinds them down or spits them out. it’s not an accident. it’s the design.  and no man...this isn’t some unique era of madness. history’s full of collapsing systems where everybody thought they were special until the floor gave out. we just dressed ours up with better graphics and debt bubbles.  trump’s not some weird outlier either. he’s what happens when the mask slips. when the polished liars can’t cover for the system’s failure anymore...you get raw narcissism right out in the open. it’s ugly sure...but pretending the old managers were actually steering us somewhere better is just nostalgia talking.  i’m not saying it to blackpill you for no reason...it’s just survival at this point. see it clearly. stop hoping for a hero to fix it. build your own life outside their game while you still can.",Famous-Garlic3838,2025-04-26T15:33:46,1

You keep referring to historical precedent as if it illustrates how normal Trump really is in the grand scheme of things, but you're ignoring how most of the cases in history where leaders like Trump appeared almost universally precede the destruction of the systems you insist they're a normal part of.
