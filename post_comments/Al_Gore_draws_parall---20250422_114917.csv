"**Summary**: Al Gore compared Trump's climate policies to Nazi Germany's ""reality distortion,"" condemning his administration's denial of science and obstruction of green energy. Speaking at SF Climate Week, Gore warned of dangerous parallels while urging action. His remarks follow critiques from Biden, Obama, and Clinton targeting Trump's policies on education and social security without naming him directly.",pharrt,2025-04-22T11:52:07,4
"Not just that but also   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoot–Hawley_Tariff_Act  So on two accounts history shows that these are failed approaches   But still try’s to sell them as wins  Can never figure out why he listens on economic strategy to someone that self quotes his imaginary friend Ron Varro to claim only his way is the right way, when clearly US history has showed exactly the opposite",nobackup42,2025-04-22T12:24:15,4

No one is claiming that he is but it's good to see moderate political leaders begin to join in saying it.,jimmydean885,2025-04-22T13:09:28,2

"So did Vance. So did RFKJr. The parallels are as clear as can be.  But note that what Vance said was that Trump had the *potential* to become ""America's Hitler."" That's what they're all saying. The parallels are to the way that Hitler seized authoritarian power. You can see similar things with Putin and Orban.   This is one way that democracies cease to be functional democracies. We're watching it happen from the inside.",KingKrasnov,2025-04-22T12:05:28,6

"> and i could do the same with obama and biden and clinton.   No, you couldn't. You could pretend to, but none of them did the kinds of things that Trump is doing that parallel the way Hitler seized authoritarian power.   > generally speaking, democrats are too worried about what might happen and not looking at what's actually happening.  What is *actually happening* under Trump closely parallels the way Hitler (and other dictators) destroyed a democracy and seized authoritarian power.",KingKrasnov,2025-04-22T12:11:01,8

"So, your parallels are that Obama gave good speeches and that Republicans wrecked the economy in 2008?  Yes, please go deeper because this ain't it.",Grandpa_No,2025-04-22T12:19:37,7
"> very charismatic, talking about hope and change and whatnot.   This isn't what people are talking about when they draw parallels between what Trump is doing now and the way that Hitler (and other dictators) destroyed a democracy and seized authoritarian power.  > claiming the country is headed in the wrong direction.   This isn't what people are talking about when they draw parallels between what Trump is doing now and the way that Hitler (and other dictators) destroyed a democracy and seized authoritarian power.  > him and hitler both came in during an economic crisis   This isn't what people are talking about when they draw parallels between what Trump is doing now and the way that Hitler (and other dictators) destroyed a democracy and seized authoritarian power.  > and then used favorable media to spread what one could call propaganda.   This isn't what people are talking about when they draw parallels between what Trump is doing now and the way that Hitler (and other dictators) destroyed a democracy and seized authoritarian power.  > among other things he did to help get us into the situation we're in now, the biggest is making it legal for the US government to use propaganda on its own citizens.   Explain?   And again, this isn't what people are talking about when they draw parallels between what Trump is doing now and the way that Hitler (and other dictators) destroyed a democracy and seized authoritarian power.  > i can go deeper   If you could have gone deeper you wouldn't have lead off with such a lame-ass list of non-parallels.  > please, give me the trump/hitler parallels.  So you denied the parallel without even knowing what it is that people are talking about when they draw parallels between what Trump is doing now and the way that Hitler (and other dictators) destroyed a democracy and seized authoritarian power?  Your favorite search engine would turn up as much as you care to see about it.",KingKrasnov,2025-04-22T12:23:33,7
