"That’s the thing, first it is just being in the country illegally, then it’s a drivers license. She has been driving likely for decades. Does that make it ok? No! Just like being in the country for 20 years doesn’t make it ok. There is no statute of limitations on being illegally in the country.",GentryMillMadMan,2025-05-09T13:03:22,21
"I keep getting attacked on Reddit for asking for sources when people scream about illegal deportations and people being grabbed without due process.   Every single case is someone super guilty so far… none of these cases are abnormal.  I’m open. I am SUPER against the idea of shredding the constitution because of the scale of the problems, but you have to base your opinions on actual facts or you’re just an idiot.  And the mainstream media is *clearly* incapable of presenting these types of situations in any form of objective way. They’re straight up just lying and shaping the narrative with their schools of descriptors (not a dog whistle, I mean stuff like calling an actual convicted criminal a “grandmother” or a “community leader” or similar) so openly and repeatedly it’s actually insane.",Blarghnog,2025-05-09T15:52:53,19
