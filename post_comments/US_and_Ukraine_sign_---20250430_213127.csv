"Among the key sticking point of the negotiations was the question of security guarantees – and whether the US would provide them as part of the deal. *Trump initially refused that, saying he wants Ukraine to sign the agreement first and talk about guarantees later*.  That was good for a laugh.  And I suspect Ukraine got the better part of this deal (they have better negotiators).  maga was just desperate to announce that some sort of deal had been signed.",dremonearm,2025-04-30T22:10:34,6
No deal with Trump will survive the next year.  He is not a credible partner and is very unlikely to survive in office for the next year.   Ukraine can and should stall for time by pretending to be interested in a deal.  But there should be no expectation that any deal will actually have any tangible results.,Beantown-Jack,2025-04-30T22:03:52,11

He signs mineral deal but did he leave tariffs in place on imports from Ukraine?,nature_half-marathon,2025-05-01T00:32:37,0
"And walking away after that statement was, and will always be, the right choice. In negotiations you hammer out every single detail before signing anything, leaving absolutely no ambiguity between the parties as what will follow. Had Ukraine signed then, they would have zero security guarantees offered ever, and full obligation to the mineral agreements that they made, all while Russia pounds their backsides.",KeviRun,2025-04-30T23:31:29,1
"That's really what this is.  It's a non-committal talking point killer for Ukraine with a small potential of upside. Costs them nothing, ends the 'he won't deal' non-sense.   I'm surprised the Whitehouse went for it as there's nothing here unless the administration actually wants to work with Ukraine.  Trump gets his win now, but he upped the costs of siding with Putin. There are still countries (and markets) holding on to a hope of a US course correction; it'll be the end of that hope if he betrays Ukraine.",nerphurp,2025-04-30T22:33:42,3
"Whos going to tell trump we wont see positive cash flow from this for at least 10 years Lmfao, he would instantly retract the deal like a baby",Individual_Space4533,2025-04-30T22:22:29,1
"I just hope Trump is prepared to square off against Russia, and it's proxies, alone.  Because that's what iappears might happen.",Postom,2025-04-30T23:10:25,0
"Good points.  Trump believes with all his heart that he is genius negotiator.  In fact, he is a terrible business man and negotiator who could not even make a go of a casino, which is the closest thing to a license to print money you can get.  Nevertheless, Trump is convinced that his legacy lies in ”winning” negotiations favorable to the US.  The point of tariffs, for Trump, is to coerce concessions from as many countries as possible.  Ukraine looks like an easy mark even without tariffs because it is in an existential fight for its existence.  Trump thinks he is a savvy negotiator because he wants to exploit Ukraine’s tragedy.   The reality is that Trump is not merely a monster, he is also an imbecile.  He wants to use tariffs to extort concessions, but all he has accomplished is killing the goose that laid the golden egg for American prosperity.  Trump is a wrecking ball destroying America, and this is not sustainable.  I don’t see how he lasts a year in office.",Beantown-Jack,2025-04-30T23:06:56,2
"As it stands, this deal is really more about tariffs than resources.  The fact is that Trump has given Ukraine all the cards it needs with his tariffs. Look at the line that Ukraine and the US will have no tariffs under this deal.  In the long run, that means the US will be able to buy raw materials from Ukraine without tariffs, so raw materials from Ukraine will be cheaper for Americans.  But in the short run, what's actually more important now is the fact that Ukraine produces food.  And zero tariffs mean that Ukrainian food will be cheaper for the US than anyone else's.  For Ukraine, getting into the US market only means that without tariffs, it will still earn more than with tariffs.   And for Trump, this means finally lowering prices on something (if, of course, he thinks of stopping trading companies from raising prices even on tariff-free products, because for corporations, the absence of tariffs will mean that they can squeeze out more profit (on the other hand, Ukraine is actually interested in its goods being cheaper on a potential new market, which means that Ukrainian special services will begin to interfere with American corporations).",Annual-Magician-1580,2025-04-30T22:55:46,3
"Why alone? Ukraine doesn't matter and won't help, you think? Hell, in fact, at this point Trump would only need to support Ukraine with air power to give Ukraine a strategic advantage on the battlefield. And if the US were to block Russian international trade from their other ports, that would be miles ahead of anything the US has done before.",Annual-Magician-1580,2025-04-30T23:30:17,3
But what would actually cause him to leave/get pushed out?  He's just had the worst 100 first days of any president ever. And all his colleagues lined up to kiss his feet and congratulate him. There's no way those pathetic spineless republicans will oust him.,SoulDancer_,2025-05-01T02:43:06,1
"I'll preface: I'm Canadian.  The US is extorting Ukraine.  The world sees that.  Former allies of the US don't accept the tactics.  They believe in a free Ukraine and would have actually sent more meaningful gear and help, save 1 or 2 members of the alliance that has supported from the beginning.    This is a rapie of Ukraine for minerals at gunpoint.  There are for sure former allies of the US that will refuse, just based on optics.    The US has sold out to Russia and is now reaping spoils, like they did in Iraq (Haliburton / Cheney).  ETA: preface.",Postom,2025-04-30T23:40:44,2
"Economic calamity would cause Republicans to look for ways to remove Trump.  A deeply unpopular Trump would generally threaten Republicans running for office at every level.  Since Trump is incapable of reforming himself or pivoting, the only alternative would be removing him.",Beantown-Jack,2025-05-01T05:01:06,1
"The detail is that look on the Internet for the text of the signed agreement. Personally, I have the impression that the US extorted money from Ukraine, and then Ukraine sent this extortion to hell and wrote its own version of the deal. Moreover, judging by everything, this version is such that soon you will again hear from Ukraine's opponents accusations that it is robbing the US.",Annual-Magician-1580,2025-05-01T00:12:22,2
I guess so...I hope so. I just have no faith in rebupicans ever removing him. He was impeached twice and they just voted for him to stay without even bothering to look at all the evidence.,SoulDancer_,2025-05-01T06:35:28,1
"You brush past the fact that no one; the US included; demanded repayment.  Ever.  90% of what Ukraine got were weapons unused or in garden sheds.  HIMARS?  It was believed to be ineffective.  Most countries had them in sheds.  Only 10% of the donations were new builds.  And I am in a country that supplied >200 new vehicle builds.  A lot of what Ukraine got was considered out of date.  Why should they pay?  They owe nothing.    Back to your original question: why are potential former allies defending the US?  Ever again?  We did once, and they made clear how they feel about any/all of us.  Straight talk: 9/11 the US was lucky to have Canada.  According to US NORTHCOM general, they still are!  But, they want to replay Russia's invasion on Canada.  They want to take Greenland from Denmark.  They have resoundingly proven unreliable to every ally they ever had.  After we all lived and some died defending them.    Once bitten.  Twice shy.",Postom,2025-05-01T00:25:36,1
They will if it is the only hope they have of surviving.  Tesla is looking for a new CEO for the same reason...,Beantown-Jack,2025-05-01T10:09:40,1
I think the issue is not about protecting the US or benefiting the US. The issue is what is beneficial for Ukraine to do. And the signed agreement does not actually give the US what they wanted before.,Annual-Magician-1580,2025-05-01T00:38:05,1
"That's not a good example, Tesla have despised Musk forever and would love a way to get him out. They won't let him get near any actual managing or designing or engineering work. Or financial decisions either, I guess (if they can stop him).   Well, hopefully it will come to that and republicans will be forced to act against trump. Instead of licking his boots as they all do now.",SoulDancer_,2025-05-01T22:34:28,1
"Actually, my original comment was about supporting the US, so it is about ""protecting the US"" if they enter into a conflict with Russia.  Which, they could likely be alone in the conflict.    But, to your first point, no deal benefits Ukraine when they are forced to negotiate at gunpoint; or, in this case, no defensive weapons until they agree.  In English, that's the definition of extortion.  Which, nearly no democratic country, accepts as a form of negotiations.",Postom,2025-05-01T00:46:11,1
"And the signed version of the deal literally does not have a clause on debts. The only debts that are possible under it are only in relation to future arms deliveries. At the same time, the US is obliged to help Ukraine attract investments, and any infrastructure and profits from the fund must be spent in Ukraine. Frankly speaking, it really looks like after the fiasco with the Tariffs, Trump is ready to sign anything just to be able to show the signed agreement to voters. Hmm, against this background, I am not even surprised that the American media do not write about what points are in the new agreement, while any references to the agreement itself are redirected to previous versions of the agreement and not to what is written. In fact, Trump is again lying that he persuaded Ukraine when it turned out the opposite.",Annual-Magician-1580,2025-05-01T01:01:12,1
"Actually, Ukraine had commitments already on investments and rebuilding infrastructure already.  All along, Canada, EU (and its constituent members), Japan, South Korea, and others had already committed to rebuilding Ukraine.  So, this point is a shell game, sadly.",Postom,2025-05-01T01:31:18,1
