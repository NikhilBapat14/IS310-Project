This is going to get really ugly. And it’s literally all self-inflicted for no good reason.,nav_2055_,2025-04-07T20:42:57,1
"Good. As an American, I fully support any ally OR foe retaliating to this horseshit. Don’t let Trump win. Pummel him into the ground and we will do to pick up the pieces when he’s finally fucking gone.",Woodrow_Finch,2025-04-07T20:43:40,1
"*From By Bloomberg News Reporters:*  China slammed the US for threatening to raise tariffs and pledged to retaliate if Washington follows through, raising the stakes of the trade war between the world’s two largest economies.  “The US threat to escalate tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake, which once again exposes the blackmail nature of the US,” the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said in a Tuesday statement. “If the US insists on its own way, China will fight to the end.” Read more [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-08/china-vows-to-fight-to-the-end-if-us-insists-on-new-tariffs).",bloomberg,2025-04-07T20:42:27,1

"Here is the thing, Tariffs would only work until a certain percentage, and like 104% would certainly be well over the threshold, after that is just basically embargo. So after that is just all the same thing.",nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-04-07T20:49:41,1

Trade wars can easily erupt into world wars and America has spit in the face of its allies and started this fucking trade war.,sedatedlife,2025-04-07T21:14:24,1

Aren't they the cause for fentalnol killing hundreds of thousands of americans,Scorned_Guardian,2025-04-07T20:51:22,1

Yes. But insulting them is not the way to work with them to address this. ,cmhsean,2025-04-07T20:58:58,1
"Well, the deindustrialisation of America was due to China's slave labour driving businesses over there which had a hugely negative effect on the poor/working class... causing systemic poverty driving them to drugs for reprieve?",Scorned_Guardian,2025-04-07T21:23:32,1
It's exactly how he should address it. Use the tarrifs as leverage. Not that hard of a concept.,Scorned_Guardian,2025-04-07T21:13:04,1
Except the tariffs aren’t being leveraged to do anything. Trump isn’t negotiating. He’s making demands after punching people in the face and threatening more.  No one is gonna listen to him and cave. This won’t have any effect on fent trafficking and will just fuck up the USA,LatterTarget7,2025-04-07T21:37:49,1
