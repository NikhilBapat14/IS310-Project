"What is the point of this post?   Seriously. What is the point?   When your house is on fire, you don't waste time expounding on how nice it would be to have a veranda or bigger TV.    We need to prioritize ending this fire, ensuring no fire comes back, and punishing those who started the fire. No reforms worthy of the name can happen before 2028. And that's if we get good new leaders. If we are very lucky, we might get a healthcare reform before 2030. Let that mediocrity sink in.   Media, donor, and electoral reforms matter so much more than actual policy ideas. Obama had 8 years and Biden had 4, but all their good policies were pointless because faux news and the Kremlin continued to stream out lies.   It's a revolting truth, but we will trip in the shit if we keep staring at heaven. ",DavidlikesPeace,2025-04-29T07:40:41,47

But I think Sanders is smart to keep health care in the public consciousness.

"We’ve seen that Democrats running on a message of “look at how bad Trump is, we aren’t Trump” tend to lose. Biden won with a “return to normalcy” campaign, but that was when Covid was making people particularly hungry for normalcy, and his administration failed at the task such that I doubt that strategy still has any credibility.   Obviously opposing and reversing all the insane stuff the GOP is doing will be a huge element of any future Democratic Party campaigns. But it can’t be the only thing. There has to be some plan for material change to people’s lives which voters can understand and appreciate; people need an alternative vision to buy into, not just a reaction to the right’s plan.  Healthcare seems like the easy answer for this. It affects everybody, and we all agree that the current system is broken. But if we’re going to run with healthcare reform, it has to be done in a way that is relatively simple and direct and beneficial to most Americans in order to get voters invested in it. Complicated regulations on insurance companies, tax credits for rural hospitals, benefits that some people qualify for but others don’t (and which many people won’t know if they qualify for) just won’t cut it.

"It's not because we are a capitalist country.  Most  other developed nations like Canada, Japan, Sweden, the UK ect  are all capitalist countries that have universal healthcare.   The reason we don't have universal healthcare in the US is because voters on the left don't consistently vote.    The Dems gave us a chance at single payer universal healthcare with the 1993 Health Security Act.  Then the 1994 midterms came along and as is tradition, the majority of voters on the left stayed home allowing the conservatives to win those midterms in a landslide.  The Republicans then shut that healthcare plan down.    But instead of understanding our history and correctly concluding that the reason we don't have universal healthcare is because the voters on the left stayed home in 1994 when universal healthcare was on the ballot, we instead act like the reason we don't have universal healthcare is because the Dems that tried to pass it were not leftwing enough.    When voters on the left stayed home during the 1994 midterms, that had long lasting consequences because damn near all of the progressive Dems in Congress that tried to give us universal healthcare were fired and all sent home packing.  Think about how much time and effort it takes to elect enough progressives in Congress to get a chance at single payer universal healthcare and the leftwing voters of 1994 threw that all away.  The reason why we don't have a lot of leftwing policies and especially universal healthcare is because voters on the left don't consistently vote.  But for whatever reason we don't want to hear that because too many voters on the left have severe apathy addictions or we think that not voting is some kind of valid form of protest.

"No. 1: We don’t want it  One key reason is the unique political culture in America. As a nation that began on the back of immigrants with an entrepreneurial spirit and without a feudal system to ingrain a rigid social structure, Americans are more likely to be individualistic.    No. 2: Interest groups don’t want it  Even as American political culture helps to explain the health care debate in America, culture is far from the only reason America lacks universal coverage. Another factor that has limited debate about national health insurance is the role of interest groups in influencing the political process. The legislative battle over the content of the ACA, for example, generated US$1.2 billion in lobbying in 2009 alone.   No 3 entitlement programs are hard to enact  A third reason America lacks universal health coverage and the 2016 candidates have avoided the topic altogether is that America’s political institutions make it difficult for massive entitlement programs to be enacted. As policy experts have pointed out in studies of the U.S. health system, the country doesn’t “have a comprehensive national health insurance system because American political institutions are because American political institutions are structurally biased against this kind of comprehensive reform.”   Absolutely nothing about the left not going out to vote.

In some cases, it could make sense to take the burden of payment for insurance off of businesses and allow the government to pay... it's possible this could allow business to allocate more money to invest in assets that will help the business be more productive than they would have been had the business taken on that payment.   I do think we need to be careful about who gets subsidized and by how much.

I didn't really want to be anything when I grew up besides doing my hobbies. I went to college and switched majors and did teaching for summers. That was it. Like most teachers. Ask a teacher what their favorite part of the job is. They'll say summers off.  Of course your on r/antiwork. That explains a lot. Once again. Things like curing cancer, entertainment, creating future technologies. All would vanish the second money was no longer involved.",AleroRatking,2025-04-29T20:26:47,1
">  And if UBI existed none of us would ever work again.... Things like curing cancer, entertainment, creating future technologies. All would vanish the second money was no longer involved.  except it wouldn't.  human society has existed for far longer than the concept of money and consumption.  most people write books, or create movies, or make videogames not because they want to make money.  the market is flooded with all of those things.  it's because they have a need to create something, to do something, to be productive and accomplish things.  before money existed, people in a society bartered for their goods... i'll trade you a dozen tomatoes and ears of corn for a chicken, i'll trade you a pair of shoes for two shirts.  but when society gets large enough, money is nothing more than a middle-man you're provided in exchange for your labor, so that you can get the things you need to survive.  but even if the basics of life were completely covered, people would STILL work to keep the society afloat.  they would still write books and make movies and cure cancer and create new technologies.  a single human might be lazy and not want to do anything other than their hobbies.  humans as a whole are an industriouis, innovative species that is always creating, always building, always *working*.  >Of course your on r/antiwork. That explains a lot.   maybe if you bothered to read some of the posts there, instead of assuming that ""antiwork"" means ""pro-laziness"", you'd realize that they aren't against work, just against exploitation.",kaett,2025-04-29T21:14:20,0
"Most people make books and movies to make money. Look at George RR Martin. Once he got rich he stopped writing.  And yes. People utilized trade before money. And they worked so they had good to trade for other goods. It was the same thing just without the middle man of currency.  So even if you got rid of money we'd still solely be working to make items that we can trade for other items. It's the exact same thing. All of history is people working to get ahead of other people, whether it's power or resources. And they use that power to get resources. Look at ancient Greece for example.  People do not work for enjoyment because there is no enjoyment in it. Id love to see your plan come to fruition and see 99% of teachers immediately quit and have no one educating your children.",AleroRatking,2025-04-29T21:18:18,1
