The administration should just start ignoring these ~~district court judges~~ circus clowns anyways. Let the Supreme Court rule on it later.,Razzlecake,2025-04-15T21:51:09,10

Trying to tell the President which reporters he has to talk to has to be among the most idiotic of many idiotic rulings weâ€™ve seen lately.  Especially after the last guy spent four years in the basement talking to no one.,cchris_39,2025-04-15T06:46:50,38

>Trying to tell the President which reporters he has to talk to has to be among the most idiotic of many idiotic rulings weâ€™ve seen lately.  They didn't. They just need to give them access. They could just let them in and very obviously refuse to call on them or acknowledge them. That or ban them for something that isn't content related.,cathbadh,2025-04-15T10:47:24,192

I donâ€™t remember the constitution giving press the right to have White House access. Nobody in the White House prevents AP from exercising their freedom of press. They just have to do it the old fashion way now. With binoculars and reading lips.Â ,Reuters-no-bias-lol,2025-04-15T12:40:07,-17

Look at all the brigaders... apparently they have nothing better to do with their time.  Nothing you said was untrue.,SonnyC_50,2025-04-15T12:35:10,-17
There is clearly established case law regarding punishing for the content of speech and press reporting. Decades of it.   Literally all they had to do was canel their pass and say it was to diversity the press pool or just stop calling on them or answer their questions. They would have no case or recourse.  None. Instead they clearly said they were punishing them for the content of their speech.,cathbadh,2025-04-15T13:22:38,110
