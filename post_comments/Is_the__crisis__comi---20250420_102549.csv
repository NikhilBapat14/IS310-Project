The supreme court delivered a fully unanimous 9-0 decision that the Trump admin had to do something and they are willfully not doing it and continue to assert that they will not do it.   Even if this man was a serial killer - they have to bring him back for due process. They refuse to produce any evidence in court - and are choosing to only try this case in the make believe court of public opinion.   Full on constitutional crisis and I'm not being facetious.   If Trump and his admin can ignore a 9-0 supreme court decision and face no penalties - what can't they do? Honestly?  We can stop asking about if - and when - he defies the supreme court - because they already have. Now it's a matter of what comes of it.,Duckney,2025-04-20T16:07:27,421
"I'm with some of the other early commenters:  I disagree with the statement that he's not openly defying the law.  He clearly is and has.     He has dishonestly and knowingly stonewalled the courts so badly that contempt proceedings have started.

"I would argue we’re in both a constitutional crisis and a crisis of truth. Many would say we’ve been living in a post-truth world for some time now. A combination of social media, reducing media literacy and increased polarisation have led to Trump being able to say whatever he wants to his supporters and they’ll just take it as gospel.   Constitutionally, this demonstrates the weakness of the courts. They have very few powers to enforce their rulings. Since Trump doesn’t care what the media says, simply branding it as “fake news”, the power of public opinion and general respect of SCOTUS can no longer be relied upon. He’s been looking for a showdown with SCOTUS, this might be it.",MiddleAndLeg_,2025-04-20T16:38:12,30

And, of course, the deportations without due process are the latest. and they won't be the last, until we work together to rid him from our government. constitutional crisis = violation of the 5th amendment protection of due process.

"The crisis of truth compounds the unfolding constitutional crisis. “Disinformation”--Intentionally flooding communication pathways with bogus claims--is designed to get people to give up trying to determine the truth.   Enemies of democracy, both domestic and foreign, use this strategy to manipulate the information environment in ways designed to deceive, disorient, divide, demoralize and bewilder the public. A constitutional republic cannot thrive without public support. Those who distrust even reliable information about politics will be less likely to defend the constitution. Public confidence in our democratic institutions, processes, and officials is breaking down.  Some say the marketplace of ideas will winnow out falsehoods. They argue that If rational citizens are given access to a full range of ideas, critics claim, they will accept true ideas and reject false ones. However, the belief that truth somehow emerges victorious from fair competition with falsehoods in public discourse is simplistic. President Obama said, “If we don’t have the capacity to distinguish what’s true from what’s false, then by definition the marketplace of ideas doesn’t work.” That’s precisely what disinformation seeks to do. People who are convinced there is no way to ascertain the truth will stop trying to find it.  Moreover, competition in economic marketplaces is not literally “free”. It relies on the government rules to enforce contracts, protect patents, prohibit false advertising and prevent unfair competition. Without these governmental safeguards, markets don’t work. Twenty-first century ""marketplaces of ideas"" now resemble “specialty shops” that are not open to new ideas but trade in only a few, pre-approved ideas. “Deep fakes” and AI-generated videos of people doing and saying things they never said or did profoundly undermine any semblance of a free marketplace in which people can evaluate ideas.",Fluffy-Load1810,2025-04-20T18:55:35,4

"One person asked where Trump was ""insinuating violence."" here is my reply:  >Where are they 'insinuating violence'?   Trump threatened:   * Liz Cheney with forced conscription (Let’s put her with a rifle, standing there with nine barrels shooting at her),  * [Mark Milley](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/111111513207332826) with execution,  * Social justice protesters with shooting (“Can’t you just shoot them?”),  * Journalists with shooting (“To get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news. And I don’t mind that so much”)  * Immigrants [left as exercise for viewer),  * Hecklers with beatings (“If you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you?”),  * [Democrats](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-suggests-hell-use-the-military-on-the-enemy-from-within-the-u-s-if-hes-reelected) with military action,   That is Trump himself. His administration is similar.   Sebastian Gorka, self-admitted neo-nazi and Trump’s senior director for counterterrorism,appeared on “Rob Schmitt Tonight” on Newsmax and said that those who publicly criticize Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s incarceration in a notoriously brutal prison in El Salvador could be committing a federal crime with a penalty up to death.   “And you have to ask yourself, are they technically aiding and abetting them?” Gorka said of critics. “Because aiding and abetting criminals and terrorists is a crime in federal statute.”   The administration's [attacks on judges](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/us/trump-judges-threats.html) have also led to bomb threats, swatting calls and even anonymous pizza deliveries to their homes as a veiled intimidation tactic.   Trump has also taken to using ICE as his personal hit squad. The current tactics used by this force include snatching people off the street while wearing plain clothes, and threatening legal citizens and residents for their jobs or political views. They have also sexually assaulted white female tourists from Australia and Germany. The plainclothes tactics have led to copycat ICE impersonators.

A clear violation of the Constitution. Nobody cared enough to do anything.  More recently Trump has invoked the Alien Enemies Act to justify his actions., It reads:  *""Whenever there is a declared war between the United States and any foreign nation or government ...""*  There is no declared war against any nation, and yet Trump is using that law anyway.

"> Arguably, we have not crossed the rubicon of a Constitutional crisis as the Trump administration is making up excuses for adhering to administered law by the courts, but not openly defying the law. He has not officially by words and action just declared he will ignore the law.  It is really not arguable. The only people that think we haven't crossed that line are people who believe the lies you bring up here:  > However, he has more brazenly lied about the law, than ever before, for example ""I won the SCOTUS case against deportation 9-0"" when he actually lost the case. Or making up lies about evidence that doesn't exist supporting his MS-13 claims for the man in question in El Salvador.  So the Rubicon is crossed. The SCOTUS is defied by the executive. You won't find many examples of dictators admitting that they have no intentions of following laws. It's much more beneficial for them to just dither and lie about it perpetually. They're never going to be like ""Ok, we're going to admit it now: We're totally authoritarian and the rule of law will never apply to us."" That's a fiction trope.

"A lot of comments are citing the SCOTUS decision about Abrego Garcia as proof that we are at present in a constitutional crisis because Trump is defying a Supreme Court order. For people making that argument, I have a question:  SCOTUS's order said that it is up to the district court to decide what is required to ""facilitate"" (no effectuate) AG's return.  Judge Xinis is currently in the process of deciding whether her order has been complied with or whether the government is in contempt. IIRC, the government has until this Wednesday to produce evidence that it is in compliance.  Suppose that the government presents sworn affidavits indicating that the administration requested AG's return and offered to cover all expenses, and that the El Salvadoran government denied that require. Then suppose that Xinis finds that the government's efforts were sufficient to comply with her order and that the government is not in contempt.  At that point, would we still be in a constitutional crisis (from this issue)? If that series of events ends the crisis, does it unwind things such that we weren't ever in a crisis? Does the crisis somehow survive despite a court finding that the government is in compliance with the court order?",bl1y,2025-04-21T18:37:46,1

Countries with good relations often have these kinds of discussions and work peacefully and professionally with each other because these kinds of one off things come up.  But if that didn't work, they could first just stop paying the amount they're already paying to house these people.  Second, if they still won't send him back, the US could then use tariffs to influence trade.... Oh wait, he's already shown he's bipolar on those.... The smart countries have started to see he isn't serious.  Third, the US being a huge economic power could put sanctions on them to leverage them, and could also sanction any other country working with them.... As long as other countries aren't organizing to work directly with each other without the US so that they can ignore those sanctions.

"That's an interesting observation. It's not just politics or power structures that create this difficulty we have in assessing the difference between what we observe, and what people are telling us we are observing. Right-wing media has spent decades telling their audience that reality is not what they can observe for themselves. Selling them on nonsense like a ""War on Christmas"", despite Christmas being the most heavily exploited marketing opportunity in our culture, where we get bombarded with Christmas messaging for more than a month before the day itself. They have sold their viewers on the idea that white men are an endangered species, despite the obvious reality that white men dominate all levers of power in our society.   So I don't think it's a failure in our education system (although, I certainly was never taught the point you're making, that authoritative regimes habitually pretend to not be authoritarian), but maybe a flaw in human nature?
