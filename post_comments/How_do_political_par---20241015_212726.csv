"I’m unsure exactly what your question is, but a lot of those dictatorships like Russia, China, North Korea, etc. are called totalitarian states. This means that your entire life, thought process included, is controlled in totality by the government. The freedom to elect a cat as mayor probably does not exist in those states",CapableWrongdoer221,2024-10-17T11:07:22,1
"Those “one party” states usually have more than one party. But in their elections, parties don’t actually get to dictate elections. People just run for office and will post their qualification resumé and people will vote for them based on the impression they left on their communities. People don’t vote for political parties, they just vote for people. In fact it’s probably closer to what our ranked choice voting will turn our elections into.  [Here’s a video that shows Cuba election process for an example](https://youtu.be/20DgWZtImUk?si=HKGT6xdD9mVOheiX).",CosmicMessengerBoy,2024-10-18T06:04:06,1
"Town tickets don't run on political tickets. However,  that leaves people at an impasse. It's what gave far right the leverage to infiltrate the local races. Ask questions, attend meetings.",bluewffle,2024-10-20T01:03:13,1
