"Putin's Russia is an enemy of the United States. Putin's government is actively engaged sowing division, spreading misinformation, compromising democracy, and penetrating key infrastructure in the United States. It is actively e gaged in weakening the United States in any way it can, including in ways as extremes as putting bounties on American soldiers. The next time someone who is not willing to sell out their country for perceived ideological common ground or personal benefit is in the white house, they are going to return to responding to such behavior with appropriate hostility.  In other words, the United States does not determine what the U.S.-Russia relationship looks like. Russia does.",K340,2025-03-19T16:01:36,24
"Donald Trump has relationships only with people, not countries. As John Bolton said, there's no other explanation for his actions: he just likes Putin, and he's always been that way. Surely, Rubio and the others need to explain his actions somehow—so they do that by inventing the China theory, which can't withstand criticism because:  1. Russia depends on China, and their fully autocratic regimes are natural allies. 2. There have been many concessions made not only to Russia but also directly to China already, such as stopping support for democracies in Asia and Africa, quarreling with South Korea and Japan, etc. 3. Alienating traditional allies and trade partners—those threatened by Russia—just to ""push Russia a little further from China"" doesn't seem like a good bargain, does it?  The future: if Putin fails to personally ""interest"" the next president in one way or another, then the latter will need to find a way to undo the concessions made by Trump and the damage done to Transatlantic unity.",Eminence_grizzly,2025-03-19T00:52:32,10
"I think it depends on who is running the US. And frankly, who ends up running Russia. Putin is not immortal.",Strict_Inspection285,2025-03-19T17:26:58,1
Does anyone else find it amusing that Putin continues to humiliate Trump in the most petty manner?  Like making him wait for their phone call while he finished a speech?,toastr,2025-03-19T18:54:28,1
America will sever its alliances but that will not make Russia an ally of the US. Russia will be glad the US shot itself in the dick and continue on as it was going to anyways. ,ScoobiusMaximus,2025-03-19T20:25:07,1

Putin is playing trump like a hooked fish. Trump is completely outclassed. The world sees it but trump’s ego is so big that he can’t acknowledge it. Trump isn’t capable of negotiating a peace treaty.,LolaSupreme19,2025-03-20T15:07:41,1
Russia doesnt produce a single thing that we don't already produce ourselves in spades.   Trump doesn't need the Russians for money he has the Arab OPEC states for that. See his ludicrous 2020 OPEC deal. no President with two connected brain cells would have signed that deal for 2 years. Cutting the equivalent of all USA oil production DAILY from OPEC's export production....Putin loved that deal as did MBS.  The mother of all pay days for OPEC which Putin and MBS used to fund their wars in Ukraine and Yemen.   Trump is a Russian asset because he's being blacmailed.,PreviousAvocado9967,2025-03-21T15:48:18,1
"I mean, by chance if AOC were elected he is immediately invading Europe again with Mina couple months. He has already stated years ago he considers the us political system to be bi-polar with inconsistent foreign relations, so the strategy is just continue creating havoc when a particular party is holding sway over the presidency.",SylvanDsX,2025-03-23T00:29:15,1

"You fundamentally misunderstand how China approaches intergovernmental relationships and their relationship with Russia. To understand China, you have to grasp a few things. In terms of foreign policy, they really only care about reclaiming Taiwan. In general, they seek to once again become the hegemon of Asia, not the world, as they were during Imeprial times. In that regard, they aren’t unlike Putin in his revanchist view of Russian and USSR imperialism. Otherwise, they are mostly pro-business. They couldn’t care less about soft power (since they have so little, relative to hard economic and military force) and will do business with anyone, whether you are the freest democracy in the world, or you’re North Korea. They are anti-American, but only because America is forced to resist China’s ambitions in Asia. China’s relatively passive toward Japan and South Korea, as other powerful Asian countries but they seek to dominate the South China Sea, which antagonizes the Philippines, and take Taiwan. The US has no choice but to oppose this, leading to our current conflict.  Russia and China are not natural allies. They are allies of convenience due to mutual anti-Americanism, but aren’t fundamentally aligned like the US and Europe have been. The USSR and China hated each other from Stalin’s death to nearly the end of the Soviet Union, which is how Nixon and Kissinger convinced China to side with them against the USSR later in the Cold War. They have fought border skirmishes and only in the last few decades, China formally ceded territory in the Northeast to Russia. China also doesn’t promote authoritarianism in other countries, and doesn’t see any kinship between itself and Russia of the back of authoritarianism. It merely sees it as beneficial for its own continued ascendancy. It is completely agnostic in other country’s affairs other than wanting to become more powerful and richer, and will support anything to further this goal.  When Nixon approached Mao, he knew that China disliked the USSR, and sought rapprochement to combat a common enemy, not because China’s ideology was in any way compatible with the US’s. The same occurs now, except China leverages Russia’s desperation to weaken the US and secure cheap goods/materials for themselves. Trump does truly want to break them apart to deal with China, but he doesn’t understand that China and Russia are economic partners more than actual allies, so any closer ties to Russia serve only to alienate European allies, not change the actual scope of Chinese economic ties with Russia. That will persist no longer how much Trump caves to Russia, so all he does is aid China in their rebuilding of relations with Europe and even other Asian countries. Already, important European heads of state, as well as Japan’s new PM, have met with Xi or talked about the necessity of increased mutual trade, which all serves to benefit China in stripping America of its global control over developed nations’ foreign policy.",danielisverycool,2025-03-19T16:54:23,2

Trump is transactional. If Putin and Xi think any agreements are going to last past his term in office they're more naive than voters that thought Trump would prioritize them ,Objective_Aside1858,2025-03-19T15:50:36,3
