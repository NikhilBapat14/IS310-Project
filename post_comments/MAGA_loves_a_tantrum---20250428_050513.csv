"From the piece:  > In the eyes of normal people, Mace, as her interlocutor said when he fled from this encounter, is a ""disgrace."" Most adults who act like Mace in public immediately wish to disappear off the face of the earth in shame. But not our Nancy! No, she's the one who posted this video online, proud of her emotional incontinence. She even offered a homophobic ""gay panic"" defense, by describing the man as ""wearing daisy dukes, at a makeup store."" (Sorry, Miss Nancy, they aren't daisy dukes until we see cheeks.) To people outside the MAGA bubble, it's a baffling choice. She's not even a fun villain. There's none of the sleek appeal of Loki from the ""Avengers"" franchise or camp glee of Ursula from ""The Little Mermaid."" Mace is serving pure toddler here. She likely wished to throw herself to the floor and start pounding it, but doing so would have meant dropping her iPhone. >  > Mace isn't wrong, however, to think that what most adults find embarrassing, the MAGA base will eat right up. The public meltdown, in which you declare yourself the world's greatest victim, is the preferred GOP method of political communication these days. Despite this effort, Mace didn't even come close to nabbing last week's gold star for the most histronic MAGA performance. She was outdone by Stephen Miller, whose usual register on TV is ""verge of a nervous breakdown,"" but got so shrill on Fox News Tuesday that Lauren Tousignant at Jezebel worried she'd soon have to ""look at Stephen Miller’s face as he pops a dozen blood vessels as his brain explodes."" >  > . . . >  > All this yelling and bellyaching serves a pragmatic purpose: to distract from how what they're saying makes no sense.",zsreport,2025-04-28T05:07:14,94
