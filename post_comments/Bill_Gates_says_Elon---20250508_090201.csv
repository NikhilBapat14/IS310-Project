"By Shane Croucher - Breaking News Editor:   Bill Gates accused fellow billionaire Elon Musk of ""killing the world's poorest children"" over the cuts to USAID, as the philanthropist brings forward a deadline to spend all his wealth on tackling global issues such as health and education.  ""The picture of the world's richest man killing the world's poorest children is not a pretty one,"" the Microsoft founder told the Financial Times.

"The 3 people that have donated the most to charity in the history of the world are Bill & Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett. Together they have donated over $120,000,000,000 to charity. Yep, that's $120 Billion with a B. Meanwhile, MAGA continues to lie about Elon donating the most but that's just another MAGA lie.  However, the Musk Foundation has also faced criticism for not distributing a large enough portion of its assets in charitable donations to meet the minimum requirements for tax-exempt status. In 2023, for example, the foundation failed to meet the 5% disbursement requirement, leading to concerns about its long-term tax-exempt status.  So basically Elon is doing what Trump does. They take money from their charities and use it as they want.   Elon & Trump only have a charity foundation for TAX EXEMPT reasons. They don't give a shit about the poor and needy.  Now I'm not a Bill Gates or Buffet fan but I am a fan of FACTS and TRUTH. So if my comment offended anyone maybe you should stop worshipping people like Trump & Elon and get thicker skin and learn how to accept the facts.",AmericantDream,2025-05-08T09:36:57,26

"A great explanation for why some people are like musk was something I saw here recently.  If there was a magic wand you could wave to make everyone on earth reasonably wealthy and fully healthy, most of us would say ""great, let's wave it!""  But Musk, and sadly a lot of people, would seek to destroy that wand.  They believe the world SHOULD have classes of people.  That some people are just inherently better and deserve untold riches and luxury, and that some people simply deserve to have hard, poor, awful lives.  Separate classes, with a large poverty class, is a GOOD thing in their world, that's how the natural order should be as far as they are concerned.  So when Musk cuts USAid to let people die, he shrugs and just says ""so what, some people are meant to be unhealthy and poor, and some of those are meant to be SO unhealthy they should die.  That's just how it works.""  You can even see aspects of that in his desire to have 1000 kids of his own.  He truly believes he is inherently better than other people.",BigMax,2025-05-08T10:39:57,9

" I feel like there is a lot of super ignorant pandering on both sides….that are missing the point, while being stuck in a colonial mindset.  	•	When Gates intervenes in African or South Asian health sectors, it’s automatically framed as moral duty, life-saving, and selfless. 	•	Musk’s cuts to USAID are framed as evil — but there is zero questioning whether USAID or Gates’s initiatives were imposed top-down without real local autonomy. 	•	The existence of billions in foreign-run health programs is assumed to be good — but no discussion exists about whether these populations had real say.  If Gates did this in London or Paris, the conversation would be completely different.  Imagine if Musk shut down a Gates Foundation project in Amsterdam or Copenhagen — would people accuse him of “killing children”? No. The question would instantly become: 	•	“Why was a private American billionaire setting Dutch health policy without democratic consent?”  The “poor” — here meaning mostly African, South Asian, Latin American populations — are treated as moral objects to be saved, not as full political agents whose autonomy matters.  In other words: Helping non-white populations is framed as an obligation. Helping white-majority populations is framed as interference. Also, in the comments section, we see zero discussion about whether Gates should have this much power over non-Western societies.  Why? Because intervention in the Global South has been normalized in Western consciousness. This is an old colonial reflex: 	•	The rich West “fixes” the poor non-white South. 	•	Questions about agency, sovereignty, or consent are considered irrelevant if the goal is “health” or “saving lives.”  If a Gates-like billionaire were overriding New York City’s public health agency? Mass protests, lawsuits, and angry editorials would follow instantly.  You guys. Some of you,  even assume — wrongly — that Musk’s hostility is racially motivated (“he wants white sons,” “he doesn’t care about non-white children”).  Whether or not that is true about Musk, the bigger hypocrisy is ignored:  It’s not Musk’s cuts that reveal racism — it’s the entire structure where non-white populations’ health and education are managed by foreign billionaires without democratic say. 	•	Musk cutting funding is an act of commission. 	•	Gates controlling global health for 20+ years is an act of omission — but it goes uncriticized because it wears the cloak of “philanthropy.”  The entire framing is: “If poor kids die, it’s because aid was removed.”  No space is given for the more uncomfortable question: “What if the structures put in place by aid were themselves exploitative, paternalistic, or undemocratic?”",therearefourlightz,2025-05-08T23:03:30,1

"The capitalist system inherently selects for individuals who are the most ruthless, obsessive, and singularly focused on accumulation—as if life were a game with a high score. This structure disproportionately rewards traits such as aggression and self-interest, while devaluing compassion, empathy, and collective well-being. As a result, those who rise to positions of greatest power are often those most willing to prioritize profit over people.

Empathy is weakness and mercy is for losers.  There is a deep NEED to become the biggest deadliest shark in the ocean, that is the one and only goal.

"Had to look it up: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerationism  Interesting you mention it because that’s how I’ve been feeling: that all of this insanity is happening at such speed for two reasons —  (1) Trump did promise to “drain the swamp”, and all his actions exposed us all to the monsters that live in it. Now we know exactly how they are and their intentions are very clear to us  (2) The system has been broken for a long time, but we had no idea how to go about it. This insanity is giving us ample time to see what exactly isn’t working, what do we want to have as a society and as a collective future, and we can all band together to make *better* things happen.   Reading you all posts here — while sometimes it’s a land of gloom, it makes me realize there’s a bunch of us good people that want to have a healthy functioning society.

"So you acknowledge that USaid does provide critical services to communities, but until more data comes into your view you're gonna assume that it's being successfully reduced without a loss of capability. So you're not the type to prevent harm, you're the type to do something after the fact. In this case, until there's a recorded spike in child mortality, you're comfortable in allowing things to stay the course.  You realize Elon's aim is complete eradication of USaid, de-funding is only the first step in that process. The issue is that there is no careful planning on what does and doesn't need funding, that's why everyone with insight to the situation is horrified.   The claim of harmfully impacting children lives through de-funding is based on the data USaid reports on from the communities it interacts with and how they've been impacted. Which frankly should be enough data for most to realize it's importance especially since it's one of the more open books on where and why on funding usage compared to other US programs and services. But you don't find that data legitimate until you see kids die?    Now I ain't no fancy data scientist with a long career like you claim to be, but must data scientist I read about try and use information and stats that have already been established to build a framework of probable scenarios to either avoid or prepare for.

So, before you claim these guys are some kind of white knights, brother, you’re sorely mistaken.   Do they provide critical aid? Yep. For sure. Actually, a lot. Lots of folks rely heavily on their support.   But let’s dig into it a bit. The claim is, Elon is killing the world’s poorest kids. Okay, my position is, that’s a very big claim. The rules of the game are big claims require big evidence. That’s the deal in every field, in every industry. Don’t even worry about data science, every field requires proof for big claims. Bill gates, is an extremely influential and powerful man. Making those statements, with no evidence, is bs. What if Elon said that the countless rounds of ineffective malaria vaccines that the gates foundations have put into people’s arms in Mali, Malawi, Myanmar and China have been chemically castrating kids. You’d expect some big evidence for a claim like that right? USAID put those vacccines in kids arms. Funded by the us military and gates foundations. You would expect a huge mountain of evidence to support an inflammatory statement like that right? Well, it’s the same thing.   Let’s change the claim all together just to “XYZ is killing kids”. You would expect that the person claiming XYZ, whatever it is, has the evidence to back up that claim.   By defunding programs that in USAID, you may not have all of the medical supplies or services they once had, but you need data to claim people are dying. It’s the worst thing that can happen.

And the evidence is based on   “The suspension impacts 222,000 people receiving daily HIV medication, 224,000 HIV tests performed daily, and essential services for vulnerable populations.”  What you fail to acknowledge is that, changing of funding doesn’t kill these people. It means that the providers will use other funds or not take 224k tests daily. You can perform 100,000 tests, weekly. 10x reduction in redundancy testing. Will someone die if they have had a test on a Monday vs a Friday? Nope, no they won’t. Is there a cure for HIV? No there isn’t. Will a 4 day lag in testing end their life? No it won’t. That’s not how HIV drugs work anyway. They lower titers which in turn decreases symptoms and makes you less prone to infection and spread.   So no, you present an opinion article; which wooosh.
