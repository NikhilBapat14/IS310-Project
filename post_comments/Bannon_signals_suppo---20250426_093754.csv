"Just Propaganda.  Yes, raise the tax on millionaires, but also ""adjust"" the tax code for more write-offs and deductions.  So the millionaires will not actually pay more taxes.",StopLookListenNow,2025-04-26T10:33:34,24
"More taxes for what? They keep cutting services. I don’t care if millionaires pay more, but between the tariffs and record spending while slashing everything, you wonder what they’re up to. I’m guessing government contracts to their buddies, but what else?",black_flag_4ever,2025-04-26T09:42:39,15
"This would be an increase in tax on the Bourgeoise millionaires, likely not the true oligarchs who don’t show much income on paper. Think doctors, lawyers, and small business owner types—folks with no real political power will see their wealth transferred upwards.",BobbySpitOnMe,2025-04-26T13:01:12,6
"Tax the millionaires to reduce taxes on the billionaires? That’ll work greeeeat, the millionaires are the local backbone of the Republican Party, local mayors etc.",PatchyWhiskers,2025-04-26T13:20:48,3
"Oh, they'll tax millionaires alright... but only the ""temporarily-embarrassed millionaires"".",squiddygoat,2025-04-26T10:48:27,3
"If a millionaire tax hike comes from trump I won’t reflexively be against it. It won’t, though.",jonermon,2025-04-26T11:08:21,3
"Yeah, by them paying him off to stop it.",bufftbone,2025-04-26T16:29:16,2
"it probably would be a win, honestly.  actually rich rich 9 figure+ people don't need w2 income and I don't think 7/8 figure folks relying on W2 are particularly trumpy.    Its a hard policy to attack.... 'But I'm just a middle class millionaire, do you know how little a million bucks is in 2025?'  it can be true and still not something anyone wants to hear.    He should do this and extend the child tax credit.",Late-Dingo-8567,2025-04-26T21:37:11,2
"Just a friendly reminder that federal governments don’t need taxes to spend - they create the money in the first place. State and local need taxes to operate. Also, taxes on wealthy are good because it reduces income inequality and reduces their capacity to drive up real estate etc.",CurrencyUser,2025-04-26T17:16:26,1
"No, it won’t help Trump. It will help the vast majority of Americans, but not Trump. So it won’t happen.",SyntheticSlime,2025-04-26T18:17:56,1
Actual criminal Steve Bannon wants to help actual criminal Donald Trump?,accidentsneverhappen,2025-04-26T19:43:01,1
"Bannon may unironically have a point here, given how popular taxing the rich is. May have an indirect effect on lowering inflation too.",jayfeather31,2025-04-26T20:10:23,1
Because there’s more non millionaires than millionaires. Meaning more people will be happy with this.    Which is the entire f’ng point.,dakotanorth8,2025-04-26T20:56:14,1
We want Bernie-like policies.  If it comes from Trump that’s fine and we will support it.,dbag3o1,2025-04-26T10:42:45,-7
"yep, this would actually be very smart - publicly raise taxes on millionaire ""income"" but don't touch capital gains, so that it appears they had their rates raised but their effective rate is the same or lower.",civil_politician,2025-04-26T20:10:39,3
