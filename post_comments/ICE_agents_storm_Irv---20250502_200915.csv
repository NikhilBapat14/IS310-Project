ICE is terrified of being doxxed?   That's on them for appearing in public without their hoods.,SerialBitBanger,2025-05-02T20:29:25,225

"Use a VPN guys. Use a No-Logging VPN. I use IPVanish. I think ProtonVPN is also good. You don't want to use a VPN service where they will hand over the logs to the feds. It's not foolproof but it's an important piece of a cybersecurity strategy. You can also use Tor Browser to connect anonymously to the Tor network for better anonymity online. But there is other data they can use to identify you. E.g., it doesn't help you to use Tor to check your Gmail, if Google already knows who you are and where you live.   Check whatismyipaddress.com. check where your IP address is showing up on geolocation. You understand that as being disclosed to the website host and potentially the government whenever you visit any site.",xXBassHero99Xx,2025-05-02T20:36:24,18

"They're going to have a progressively harder problem with that as time goes on. Trump's approval rating is plummeting, and his base of die hard support appears to have eroded from about 30% to 25% based on later polls. As empty shelves hit, the approval should drop even more. It's a card he needs to play early on since he's fucking incompetent.  What that means is if they try to occupy the US, they are actively losing support to make that happen on somewhat friendly terms. And the US is a giant country. We couldn't fully control Baghdad and Kabul, let alone fully controlling the entire US.",omgpuppiesarecute,2025-05-03T08:21:58,8
