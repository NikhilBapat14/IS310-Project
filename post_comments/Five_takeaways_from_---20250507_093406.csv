Trump is afraid of interviews like this.,Ok-Hello-0,2025-05-07T09:37:06,10
I heard the interview this am on a BBC radio news programme. Really interesting to hear. Thoroughly recommend a listen. Most of what he said was very insightful and compelling.,bickering_fool,2025-05-07T09:46:52,9
"The Biden administration had a lot of success and it's remarkable how little credit they get for it.  And I continue to believe that Biden was uniquely positioned to defeat Trump in 2020.  But he promised to be a one-term transitional president and the trappings of power led him to change his position, at the same time as those around him failed to act on his obviously declining capabilities.  And the unforgivable failure of the Biden administration will be, from a historical perspective, the inability to bring Trump to account for January 6.  That's on Biden and certainly on Garland.    So, at this point, the gerentocracy that is the Democratic Party is much of the problem.  While I can appreciate some wisdom from President Biden, I do look at what's happening now in the US and place some blame on him personally.  Let history be written.  Meanwhile, we've a democracy to worry about.",CrimsonFeetofKali,2025-05-07T10:10:17,7
"I think once biden slows down and isnt under pressure or extreme stress he can speak way more clearly and coherently than orange  Orange might be able to put together words easier, but his words make no fucking sense, biden stumbles a bit but hes coherent and intelligent still",PurpleStrawberry1997,2025-05-07T10:20:31,4
Interesting he had to do the interview with the BBC.   American news outlets are probably too risk-averse at this time to interview him.,473713,2025-05-07T10:02:29,3

Exactly right. The fact that the media went along with the narrative that he was failing mentally is infuriating. We are suffering the consequences now.,Curious-Learning-87,2025-05-07T09:51:32,18
It’s all not good when you keep in mind these guys were and are president.  I just am so taken aback when I see a speech from Obama when he was in office. It’s honestly so far removed from our consciousness that I recommend every go back and watch an Obama speech. It makes me feel shame for what we have today.,hmr0987,2025-05-07T16:34:19,1
"Let me translate this for the less politically inclined users; American ""News"" outlets don't  want to deal with the repercussions that would come from the US Govt/Executive Branch if they gave Biden this interview. We need to stop sugar coating shit. The US is now essentially no better than fucking Qatar/Al-Jezerra.",Glass-Shock5882,2025-05-07T10:09:25,9
It was done with the BBC to commemorate VE day. It was a platform however to voice his 'concerns' and disgruntlment.,bickering_fool,2025-05-07T10:19:45,0
Because he gave an interview he’s being brought back by democrats?   And Republicans are fascists.,rottenavocadotoast,2025-05-07T10:11:02,7
What a weird reaction.,Outside-News-5708,2025-05-07T10:26:31,4

"I’m no Trump fan and would rather have Biden in office if that was the only alternative but are you really saying that the trusted media reported much at all on Biden’s mental faculties?  We heard practically nothing from trusted sources about his cognitive state. It really wasn’t until the debate in June that we saw anything of major concern. We’re suffering the consequences of the Biden Administration hiding his cognitive decline. Can he perform for the camera for periods of time? Sure, but being president is a 24/7 job. And before you say anything I think Trump is just as problematic, his decline is clear as day.  Biden has lost a step and that’s fine, it’s the whole point. The guy is old. What should have happened is in 2023 Biden bow out of the election and let the democrats pick their next president. Not doing that is why we’re suffering.",hmr0987,2025-05-07T16:32:20,2
