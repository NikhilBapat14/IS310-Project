"A sub committee focused on government efficiency, spending meetings talking about legislation for ~ 10 NCAA athletes out of thousands , isnt really efficient   The committee is essentially a Karen committee for Marge.",swiftfoot_hiker,2025-05-09T13:17:28,16
"At some point, the media has to realize this is exactly what MTG wants.  She receives far more coverage than anyone else in Congress, and it it's playing right into the whole point she's in office: to use that office as a platform to spew her vile ramblings that would otherwise be drowned out by other right-wingers if she wasn't in Congress.  The goal is ultimately to launch a more lucrative career in a higher position, like the Senate, Georgia governor's mansion or most likely, the current administration.  Probably the only reason Trump hasn't appointed her for something yet is because even a lot of the Freedom Caucus can't stand her, and because she's openly challenged some of his actions.  But I would really rather not see her crap continuously amplified in headlines every damn day.",AcrobaticEdge5907,2025-05-09T13:34:36,5

"That issue should have never needed to go to a higher authority than the NCAA in my opinion.   If it comes up in any other organization, same thing. What ever the governing body says, that should be it.",Bruce-7891,2025-05-09T13:55:44,6

"I'm 100% with you, but we have to recognize that's what happened about 15 years ago. Then conservatives got big feelings they can't back up.   The fact people refuse to even build a case based on trans athletes, instead moving as swiftly as they can to talking about general male/female differences proves this.",rougepenguin,2025-05-09T15:00:41,4
The entire trans-athlete narratives were just an excuse by MAGA to be bigots and were a political tool by Trump and the GOP to manipulate those bigots into manufactured outrage.   .002% of athletes in the NCAA were trans. The NCAA is a private organization. They should be free to set the rules of their league without government dictation.  And they acted like trans-athletes were a new thing. Transwomen have competed since the 1977. Nearly 50 years.,JournalistRecent1230,2025-05-10T00:46:10,2
