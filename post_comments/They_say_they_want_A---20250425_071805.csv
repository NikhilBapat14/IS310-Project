"A short time ago, I wouldn't have believed it, but this is becoming a thing. Now these groups have the backing of the government. In just 3 months we've descended into a terrifying dark age. You can no longer sugarcoat or claim they are fringe. It's happening, NOW.   Interviews from the Pro Natalism Conference-  >Last month in Austin, Texas, many proponents of pronatalism met up at the second Natal Conference, known informally as Natal Con, where the mood was exuberant. Many there see this moment as a chance to advance their agenda through perceived allies in the Trump administration, including Musk and Vice President Vance.  >And generally, women should not have careers. They should be socially stigmatized if they have careers..""  >The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its progeny are probably the single most destructive set of laws in American history, and all should be wiped forever from the history of this nation...""   >On their podcast, however, the Collinses say reversing demographic collapse is not possible without addressing ""wokeness"" or ""progressiveness,"" which Malcolm refers to as ""the urban monoculture and its goal of cultural genocide.""  >Many national governments facing birth rate declines have launched policies to try to raise fertility, with mixed results. None has succeeded in sustainably raising birth rates above ""replacement rate"" without also drastically increasing maternal mortality and the number of orphaned children, as was the case with Romania's total ban on contraception and abortion beginning in the 1960s.  ..   >Some pronatalists agree and point to evidence that generous government policies raise birth rates. Still, they haven't always put their full support behind enacting those policies. As a U.S. senator, Vance suggested more than doubling the child tax credit to $5,000 a child, weeks after he skipped a vote on a bill to expand the benefit. Musk's DOGE has targeted funding for the Department of Health and Human Services and laid off employees who administer Head Start child care.  >But many more pronatalists, including Natal Con's organizer, Kevin Dolan, see their biggest allies as those in the White House right now.  ...  One supporter, Dolan , was kicked out of DOGE after his creepy online history -  >For example, he described love between men and women as a ""relationship between superior and inferior.""...""And that brings us back to where we started with selective breeding.""  >The idea is essentially that our society has become excessively effeminate, weak, compassionate,"" said Matthew McManus, a lecturer at the University of Michigan, ""and what they want to do is breed or elevate an aristocratic class that's going to be masculine, violent, not necessarily motivated by, let's call it empathy."" ... >""Women are to be subordinated to men. [They] largely are going to be responsible for managing the household, although with no real particular authority. And of course, they're going to have an awful lot of children,"" said McManus.  ...  >Passage Press, which sells books arguing Black people are inherently more criminal and less intelligent than white people. Passage Publishing's founder, Jonathan Keeperman, both spoke at and sponsored this year's Natal Con.  >In the past, Posobiec marched in and promoted demonstrations in Poland that included antisemitic, neo-fascist groups chanting support for ""white Poland."" Asked for comment, Posobiec has previously told NPR to ""enjoy being defunded.""   >""It's been my experience that if you are unwilling to include people who have been labeled [racists], that is functionally a choice to exclude an incredible percentage of people who are thoughtful and interesting and have something new to say.""  >Race suicide included fears that some people, like the poor, or new waves of Italian, Polish and Jewish immigrants, had too many babies, which led to widespread programs of sterilizing supposedly ""unfit"" groups in the United States. These and other American policies, like anti-miscegenation laws, went on to influence some of the ""racial hygiene"" programs of the Nazi party.  >The ""great replacement"" is a racist concept, promoted by at least one Natal Con speaker, that populations in majority-white nations are deliberately being ""replaced"" by nonwhite immigrants.   >""In their eyes, this is the path to what they term white extinction,"" ..  >To go and start calling a whole crowd of people Nazis seemed a rather odd thing to do,"" he told NPR.  >Dolan also featured speakers such as Jack Posobiec, a hard-right political operative who first gained notoriety after spreading the Pizzagate conspiracy theory during the first Trump term. Posobiec is close to the Trump administration and has used antisemitic memes on social media.  ... >There has been a deliberate investment by tech elites to rehabilitate these ideas.  ""We're seeing a far more publicly sanitized set of big arguments being presented at the forefront and different sorts of speakers coming to the forefront as public faces of the movement,"" said Feola.",SicilyMalta,2025-04-25T07:36:53,21
