"Maybe because transgender people only make up around 1% of the population.  Nobody is being forced to change gender and nobody is advocating for random gender reassignment of minors.  Just let them live their lives in peace and leave medical decisions up to individuals, their guardians, their loved ones, doctors and counselors, preferably in that order.    Leave decisions about eligibility in sports up to the organizations running the sport.  Trans issues are pushed by the right, as being championed by the left, because it makes people uncomfortable.  The right wants to keep trans issues front and center because it gives them another target besides immigrants.",BluWake,2025-04-28T08:29:02,729

"The only group that made politics about trans people were republicans. Then, because it was the right thing to do, democrats got involved to say, ""hey now, trans lives are important too! So stop attacking them."" This was followed by Fox News and republicans making it their entire identity to ""Fight For Women!!"" While simultaneously stripping cis gendered women the right to select their own reproductive healthcare, trying to strip their right to vote with the SAVE Act, and coming soon to a fascist state near you: force women to undergo invasive genital checks before playing sports or using a bathroom to make sure that trans women stay in their lanes.

"What sucks about this argument in the US right now is that the side against trans people actually includes 2 groups of people: 1. Those who are mostly neutral/don’t LOVE trans people and think they shouldn’t be in gendered sports. They also are usually against gender affirming care for children. Sometimes they fall for right wing talking points that make those topics seem like more of an issue than they actually are. They often don’t HATE trans people, they just don’t understand or “agree” with the “lifestyle,” and believe there should be some kind of regulations on certain scenarios. (Most Americans fall in this category) 2. The extremists who hate trans people. The ones who go on air saying “transgenderism should be eradicated from public life”, make up lies like the litter box hoax to get other people on board, suggest brutal legislation against trans people of all ages, are occasionally violent, etc. They create and parrot rage inducing articles like “Trans Leftists Want the Sun to be Renamed to the Daughter for Gender Equality”, which paints trans people and their supporters as insane and irrational.  Together, these groups make up a majority of the population. Negative + Neutral will outweigh Positive alone every single time.  Group 1 often does not care about trans issues beyond sports and minors. Their attention on the issue ends after those points. Group 1 is often listening to what Group 2 and believing it (again, like the litter box hoax). Group 1 will almost ALWAYS vote with Group 2, or often not vote at all. Once it’s done, they don’t care. Nothing about the situation impacts their lives further.   But Group 2 cares. They were on the attack, not the defense. And when they win- carried on the backs of neutrality and people who are “not AGAINST trans people, but..”- they get to do what they said they wanted to do from the beginning. So now we have these bills, Executive Orders, news articles, laws, etc. The smaller number of people who actively wish trans people harm/hate them are left alone to make the decisions once the moderates on the topic got what they wanted. Nobody ‘neutral’ will stand up and say “hey, this is wrong”, because they didn’t want the alternative of trans people in sports or hormone blockers for children.  Plenty of Americans don’t want the government to focus on trans people, but they also don’t want the “Gender Extremism” that Fox News tells them would take over if the left won. So they make their vote and don’t care what happens afterwards, because one side included what they wanted/saw as more reasonable.",funeralmarching,2025-04-28T11:53:54,0

So if they won’t shut up and let trans people quietly get whatever support they need to transition then we can’t shut up either with the loud support.   No one was giving children bottom surgery. That swimmer who whined about a trans athlete beating her tied with the trans swimmer in FIFTH. Trans people just want their hormones if they’re taking them and to be just left alone and be accepted.

Most likely, it sounds like for athletic individuals it would take longer to reach the same place, (maybe 6-10 years), or longer for height and bone density.  Which, oddly enough, probably means that in public schools they would remain on the team of their original sex if they wanted to compete in sports, but obviously should have no bearing in cross-sex sports. Some sports might not require that, however, such as shooting, where the difference is negligible anyway, or archery which would likely normalize after 4-6 years. Contact sports would likely require waiting around a decade.  All that said, IMO we need a system that doesn't actually rely on sex.

"tbh I think social issues only become a reasonable deciding factor in voting choice during times of comfort. The global economy issues in post-covid have been the main thing on the median voters mind in every election since.  My take is that: the main things that worked against the Democrats which the Republicans exploited in their campaign are two-fold:  1 - The Democratic campaign was so tied to protecting the reputation of Biden’s term that they wouldn’t acknowledge active financial struggles since it would reflect poorly on Kamala for being VP in that period. It was like saying “everythings fine, why are you upset?”. People are hurting and the Democrats didn’t really speak to that, Trump did.  2 - The Republicans and MAGA alike then proceeded to stir up an astronomical amount of fearmongering culture war bullshit. Trans rights, abortion, gaza, immigration, corruption, haitians are eating the cats and dogs, transgender surgeries on illegal aliens in prison, you name it. This immediately backs the Democrats into a position where they basically HAVE to constantly address these issues like “wtf is wrong with them, no of course we disagree”. Even then some of these did strike divisive chords among the party and voters like what was mentioned, so it wasn’t as quick to mobilize a response that effectively shut it down then moved on.  Both these factors contributed to an overall narrative that Kamala and the Democrats don’t care about fixing Americans’ economic hardships and would rather focus on “being woke”, while Trump and the Republicans don’t care for being woke and DO want to solve those issues. Obviously, this isn’t *really* the case, but that’s not what matters when optics play a pivotal role in deciding votes.   There’s of course the devout followers of Donald J(esus Christ) Trump, but the median population voted in alignment with this perception since economy is their current concern, and now that they’ve seen how that’s working out, Trumps public profile is tanking.

"This is why nothing ever gets done.   You're right, there probably were similar arguments made in Germany way back when, and those arguments are STILL valid. Whether you like it or not, people tend to not care about others when they can't buy food, can't work, can't provide for their families, or have good shelter. People DO care about these issues, but they will innately care about their survival more because if there is no ""me"" then there is no world, there is no caring. I can't exactly care about a trans child's rights when I am on the verge of starving, or losing my home due to factors I can't control.  But the way you picture it makes it sound like said desperate people are evil for not caring about someone they may NEVER see in their lifetime, and then you wonder why they keep getting pushed further right, and it's because of this rhetoric. Again, you're right, people really only care when its their rights being affected. But making them feel like villains for not caring about anything aside from their own survival will ensure they never do, it will make them close off their empathy simply because they feel like villains just for surviving. You're asking people to fight a war, when they're already fighting several.  Granted, the Germans didn't just go after Jews, they went after the disabled as well.

Well you could start by not advocating trans people en masse just lay down and die for the cause in the hope that with trans people gone liberals can win elections again.

"Ok, so you need to understand that nobody understands your medical situation. None, nobody.  Everyone believes that you're doing elective medicine - that is a huge hill you've got to climb very, very quickly. Its  going to be incredibly difficult bc they are manufacturing and enormous shortfall in Healthcare - if you require any money from the government, it will absolutely be ending, I don't even know you could still be getting it, tbh.

I hope that my work de-stigmatizes trans and GNC folks, raises awareness, and sheds light on the discrimination and issues we face.  I'd do more but I also got to keep a day job to be able to maintain the community work that I *do* do.  But if at least one trans person is hurt a little less in life because I was out there doing my thing and influenced the person that otherwise would have hurt them, it'll all have been worth it to me.

"I'm having two conversations about this in this thread right now. I've already spelled out that you don't need to spell out anything to me.  Im glad you realize that we may need all 3 boxes.  I grew up very rural - the work you are doing absolutely helps kids, I understand that bc I'm gay and I've lived out here forever - these are the most conformist places in thks country. Men can't wear pink unless it's for breast cancer awareness, Men can't drink Bud Light, Men can't be gay, people cant be Trans.  When I say Men cant be gay, if I open Grindr or Sniffies rn - there will be multiple profiles of ""Straight man for Straight man Discreet"" - thats incrediblely common. I get hit on by more married men, normally in sight of the wives - the psychological issues in rural communities is an epidemic, most of these people are so unhappy and hate their lives so much - they just want to blame anyone but themselves.  We've been given to them. Plus, being anti gay is great way to convince your wife that your not hooking up with the guys in your neighborhood.  Stuff like your outreach and the materials you bring to schools, end up in these echo chambers, where its used to prove that we are trying to make all the kids pink people. I'm quite certain many more people than you are aware of are aware of what you do. I dont know that a kid discussing any of that with their parents right now, would be good for them to do.   I insuinated that my brothers son could be gay, he doesn't know - I've never made him that mad. Im gay. It was interesting. Him and his wife, who is a stay at home Mom with a HS education are now going to be homeschooling their kids - bc that will stop him from being gay?? My brother is a GM - he's kinda of a bigger deal in a large Trumper clique, if he had a gay son, that would change, they would cancel him.  Im not sure what we should do. You need to know what you are actually up against tho - a mountain of horrible lies. Illogical and circular thinking bc people don't want to understand.",jakktrent,2025-04-28T19:08:02,1
"It changes everything. If we can get control, we can impeach him in 26 - we need at least one of the branches  to stop a lot of his moves.  It also should prevent US from being rounded up, if they win again, it'll validate what they are doing, they will escalate everything immediately following those elections.  I do not know that they will even be fair. So, we need to fan the fires for the class war. People are struggling to eat, we can get a revolution if we advance the class war far enough, and they shut us down.  We may need a revolution to stay alive.  I fucking hate saying this shit - if Im going to edge lord, I normally do it around stuff like I dont want leaders anymore, not ending the culture war.  This is politics tho - despite everything Americans know, politics is one of the most important things in life - bc it wields the power that sits over all of us. We need to win an couple of elections, like we can't lose them.  26 is only 2 years later, Americans have a short memory but they've latched on to the Trans issues bc its their justification for everything is Trump is doing, Ive literally read them discussing how bad their portfolios look but ""at least he ended DEI tho"" - I'd like that issue not to be the one we bank our lives on, rather the ""we are all broke"" one of those can't be argued, the other will be incessantly.  I really wish this wasn't going to be such a battle. Im going to have to fight the establishment Democratic leadership tooth and nail, just to get them to actually try to win an election and not di3 by their principles.

"> It changes everything.  No ... ... it doesn't.  At least to a person dependent on HRT.  When you're AMAB and your testicles have been removed (whether for vaginoplasty or just orchiectomy alone), you no longer produce your own sex hormones.  You need the estrogen that you take -- the hormones Republicans are trying to take away -- in order to have a normal life expectancy and avoid complications.  > We may need a revolution to stay alive.  Almost certainly we will, yes.  > 26 is only 2 years later, Americans have a short memory but they've latched on to the Trans issues bc its their justification for everything is Trump is doing, Ive literally read them discussing how bad their portfolios look but ""at least he ended DEI tho"" - I'd like that issue not to be the one we bank our lives on, rather the ""we are all broke"" one of those can't be argued, the other will be incessantly.  Sure, they can say that.  Why does ""getting rid of DEI"" also, in your mind, include eliminating healthcare for trans people?  I really just don't understand your need to enable the government throwing specifically us under the bus in this way.  > The whole time Trans people, and people pretending to be Trans people, will be acting like im k1ll1ing babies.   People pretending to trans people?  Why on earth would anyone want to do that.  We're like the most reviled population in the country.

Every direction we can go is a corner.  The worst part is that its not like no one knew this was coming.  Everything was clearly spelled in Project 2025.  There were clear warnings -- I know because I work with some of the people that made them and screamed them across timelines and in whatever interviews they could book.  People voted fascists in anyway.  Its just so disheartening, the level of disinformation and lies.  > When is this this is supposed to go down - the taking away of the hormones?  It'll come to different people at different times and people in [some states with statutory guarantees for gender affirming care](https://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/healthcare/trans_shield_laws) may be protected so long as their states maintain those guarantees in the face of federal defunding, but it all kicked off [last month](https://www.madycast.com/p/proposed-hhs-rule-would-ban-trans).  RFK Jr's HHS started the rulemaking process by opening public comment period for [new HHS regulations](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/19/2025-04083/patient-protection-and-affordable-care-act-marketplace-integrity-and-affordability) that among other things would remove gender affirming care from the ACA's essential health benefits list, which means ACA marketplace plans in non-shield states would start to drop it as soon as they could.  That comment period ended on the 11th of this month, so they can put it into place anywhere from a month from then to whenever, depending on their political preferences.  Once the rule gets an effective date, private group/non ACA plans in non-shield states will likely follow suit thereafter, either in the coming year's plan policies or the next thereafter, as there'd be no reason for them to cover things not on the EHB and not being covered by competitors unless they were getting some kind of pressure to do so.  The shield states themselves are the next risk factor at that point -- with gender-affirming care no longer on the EHB, states have to foot the bill for the people in their states on ACA plans that want it.  Some likely won't stay reliable -- New Jersey and Arizona's shield status comes from governors executive orders alone.  People in the effected areas just end up without access to the medication they need, unless they're resourceful and can mail-order their HRT from other countries like Brazil where you don't need a prescription, Walter White it together in labware from precursors, or find a very friendly doctor willing to risk writing them some kind of prescription for it for offlabel, non-gender-affirming care reasons that would still warrant coverage.",Elseiver,2025-04-28T20:49:38,1
"The more we've talked, the more I think its also to trap to do what I've been suggesting.  DEI being over doesn't really mean anything, so we all roll with that, exactly what I said earlier - get that distance that Newsom is trying for right now, start talking about the class war (not Newsom, just that dems pivot) and then this RFK stuff, the background changes will start taking effect.  Trans people all over the country will be in legitmate need of actual political assistance but all the politicians that actually would, will have just said what used to be meaningless words but will then be defined as trans in specific.   The term has intentionally been very vaguely defined so it could be applied to any non white man issue, its why I wanted to define it as the whole culture war itself. We, of course, dont have the power to actually define it tho, especially not if they are waiting for this pivot. This is some pretty devious shit.  It is important to note when the red states actually do start dropping off coverage - if it isn't immediately, bc based on their rhetoric, that is what ought to happen. If it doesn't, it means they intend to control the timeline of when everyone taking hormones start getting desperate.   I need to educate myself more on all of this. It was entirely my ignorance to some of the basic issues of your life that almost had me trying to move the whole party into yet another corner.
