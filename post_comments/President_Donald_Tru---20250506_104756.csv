"Just go here:   [https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/trump-approval-rating-by-state](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/trump-approval-rating-by-state)  Sorry, that data is old and so is the data in the article. They're citing Feb 2025 numbers.",CockBrother,2025-05-06T10:55:02,7
The fact that these numbers are not zero just goes to show that Americans are among the dumbest and/or most ignorant people in the world.,MinimumBigman,2025-05-06T10:54:21,18
Of course he's most popular in all of the worst states in the country.   The Confederacy...and states that wish they could have been a part of the Confederacy.,HPLREH777,2025-05-06T11:16:06,3
"I mean, if you get past hyperbolic ""His numbers should be zero!"" and look at it objectively, some of these numbers should be seriously concerning for Trump and Republicans: 53% in Florida, 50% in Ohio, 49%(!) in Iowa...  Because, given how partisan times have gotten and the almost sports team mentality that voters have adopted, there's no way his numbers will ever get below 30%. Even Dubya only hit 27% towards the end and he was so unpopular that Republicans were distancing themselves from, or even out right disowning, him.",Subliminal_Kiddo,2025-05-06T13:00:39,2

I thought most Americans are smart...Nah!!!,Galaxy_AI,2025-05-06T11:01:48,1
There's alot of them over 50%.  Hawaii and Vermont lowest at 26%.,White_Meteor,2025-05-06T11:21:10,1
"* so far.  Just wait: the economic pain, the empty store shelves, the ensuing recession has barely gotten started.",CloudsGotInTheWay,2025-05-06T11:29:29,1
"Good way to look for states that might be tolerable to live in. Hawaii, California, and Vermont look good.",smithpd1,2025-05-06T11:35:46,1
"Has anyone compared this to the electoral map from the 2024 election? Curious if any Trump states have ""flipped"".",wifeofsonofswayze,2025-05-06T18:27:38,1
Thank you. This is easier to read.,xHappyAcidx,2025-05-06T12:16:56,1
Don't forget how much racism/bigotry influences their choices.,DepartmentOfJustAss,2025-05-06T10:59:01,10
"America didn't vote for trump, some Americans did. The rest of us are just along for the ride.",AcanthisittaNo6653,2025-05-06T22:32:49,1
Are you joking or are you serious? Americans are dumb as hell. I mean they voting for this orange man twice.,Economy_Swim_8585,2025-05-06T11:04:03,6
"Washington State... the Western half. As good as Vermont, by my guess.",Impulsive_Artiste,2025-05-06T14:50:38,1
That is the main reason the love the policy if a white person male of course,truelogictrust,2025-05-06T11:06:04,3
You could kinda make an argument that even before Trump came into power Americans weren't the brightest bunch either.,Mobile-Olive-2126,2025-05-06T12:26:20,2
Apparently some aren't even smart enough to understand that not all Americans are the same.,ithacaster,2025-05-06T19:36:47,1
"Well its not like biden did much except continue to enrich the upper class at the expense of the lower classes. Why did we need a 2nd round of PPP?  Why did the Dems decide to make PPP completely tax free?  Why did they allow companies to qualify for ERC after PPP.  (ERC was supposed to cost $35B but after the changed ended up costing $350B).  Why did the Dems allow the SBA to throw about $500B in low-interest fix loans?  Rich got massive amounts of money that they used on real estate, crypto, stocks and other things to enrich themselves.  Then when it came time to tax the rich somehow some nobody from AZ said she'd vote no and we never heard about taxing the hedge funds in NY, CT, MA, IL, NJ and CA again.",giabollc,2025-05-06T22:39:23,0
