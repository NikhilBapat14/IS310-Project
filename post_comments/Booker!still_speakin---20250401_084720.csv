CALL  YOUR  SENATORS!  Demand they support Cory Booker! Look up your Senator and call their DC office if listed. I got through to someone at a DC office immediately for one of mine and left a message with the other. FLOOD THE PHONES.  “Hello my name is _____ I’m calling today as I’m watching Senator Cory Booker’s speech live on the floor. I was just wondering if Senator _____ had any plans to support Senator Booker’s  lengthy speech either with a public statement or more directly by taking the floor and asking him a question so that he may yield his time while retaining the floor? As her/his constituent I would love to see Senator _____ support Senator Booker’s efforts here.”  Edit: copy this script and reply to any comments voicing support for Booker you see in other threads too,Several-Candidate115,2025-04-01T11:50:19,6

"So proud of him.  I know this is just my hopium reflecting here but I've been thinking (way too long admittedly haha) about a silver lining to this... In 11 years, SCOTUS may turn from a 6-3 conservative majority to a 6-3 democratic majority, and it all depends on the momentum we're starting to see today.  Here's how:  First, if Harris won and the republicans held the senate/house (and then got further gains in the mid-terms in 2026 per historical norms), it's likely (given that we're overdue) a recession would still hit before 2028.... and a JD Vance or someone else would take the helm on the right in 2028 because Harris is seen as a Biden extension and an generally 8 years of someone is met with an opposite reaction (ie Clinton to Bush, Bush to Obama, Obama to Trump). Now, what does this have to do with SCOTUS?  Well, Thomas/Alito are the two oldest and two most stringent conservatives.  They are 76 and 75 respectively as of April 1st 2025.  There's no realm or universe in which they leave the bench before 2028.  Ego reigns supreme among the 9 (see RGB).  So in a ""long play"" sense of the word, everything in present day should hopefully swing the other way, from special elections in Florida's 1st/6th, the Wisconsin SCOW race today, the Virginia/NJ gubernatorial races in 7 months,  and finally the mid-terms and 28 election. If that happens and enough momentum is built and sustained, we usher in a newsom/shaprio/insert white guy here because dear god stop running women it's not happening anytime soon as much as I would love it....  So again... SCOTUS?  Alright so getting to that point, this then puts the above two SCOTUS members squarely into their 80's, meaning up until spring of 2032 (historical viability for nominations to pass through the Senate, Merrek Garland not withstanding), the two SCOTUS guys in question will be clocking 83 and 82.   Could they still be on the court by spring of 2032? Sure.  But is it possible one drops off (or biology happens) during the 2028-2032 years?  Yes.  Now hold onto your hats because even more crazy is this reality.  During 2032-2036 here are the ages of the current oldest SCOTUS members, if the 9 on the bench today stay on, as of April 1 2036:  Thomas - 87, Alito - 86, Roberts - 81, Sotomayor - 81, Kagen - 75.  So, to reverse engineer this...given that historically, incumbent Presidents have a big electoral advantage, then whoever is in position to nominate these 4 by or before April of 2036 is vital.  That person needs to be someone who won re-election in 2032.  In order to do that, they need to win initially in 2028.  To do that, we need backlash to help swing the mid terms in 2026 and carry that forward to 2028.  I know hope is seemingly dark and lost right now, but I have a feeling this is the Democrats Tea Party movement.  Republicans are complacent and feel they have a ""mandate"" when in reality, they had temporary, effective messaging against unlucky global backlash towards incumbents all across the world (ie right place, right time, can't replicate it again).  Can you imagine what would happen if the above scenarios play out and Thomas/Alito/Roberts all retire, with Sotomayor and Kagen learning from RGB and bowing out early/semi early? A fresh bench of 5 young under 55 Democratic members of SCOTUS coupled with Jackson who would be 65 by the time this scenario unfolds.  A solid 25-30 years of Democratic control of SCOTUS.  This CAN happen... and it all starts today!",reezick,2025-04-01T10:50:23,1
