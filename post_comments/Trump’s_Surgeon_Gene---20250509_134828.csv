"The ""MAHA"" movement is a propaganda worded bullshit thing to sound good on Fox News while doing exactly the opposite of the name.  So, no. This pick is perfect.  Excuse me while I go scam some idiots into buying my moonlight and lard soaked sugar crystals that cure autism caused by vaccines.  Also, smash that YouTube subscribe button and follow me on Instagram. My crystals are available on my Facebook Marketplace page.

"There are a lot of reasons to question President Donald Trump’s decision to nominate Casey Means to be surgeon general. She is not currently [licensed as a doctor](https://omb.oregon.gov/Clients/ORMB/Public/VerificationDetails.aspx?EntityID=1530903), failed to [finish her surgical residency](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/05/09/nx-s1-5392389/casey-means-trumps-surgeon-general), and has [voiced anti-vaccine opinions](https://www.caseymeans.com/learn/newsletter-35) and embraced unproven alternative medicine, including [advocating for raw milk](https://bsky.app/profile/marisakabas.bsky.social/post/3lomizvr6uk2j) and [talking to trees](https://www.caseymeans.com/learn/newsletter-32?rq=love).  But her questionable credentials are not the reasons why a large cohort of anti-vaxxers, extremists, and far-right figures are angry about the nomination, which Trump credits to health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  For figures like former Kennedy running mate Nicole Shanahan and renowned anti-vaccine activist Mike Adams, better known as the Health Ranger, Means is nowhere near extreme enough in her views, and is viewed as a “[Manchurian asset](https://x.com/NicoleShanahan/status/1920308773979353102).”  “She's not a health freedom advocate,” Adams [wrote](https://x.com/HealthRanger/status/1920263718736163076) on X. “She's not a vaccine truther. She'll never recommend natural cancer cures or remedies. She's basically cosplaying as a MAHA champion. In reality, she is an establishment pick, and she'll push the establishment narrative. 100% guaranteed. Count on it.”  [Conspiracy theorist](https://www.wired.com/story/donald-trump-laura-loomer/) Laura Loomer, meanwhile, who has enough influence in the White House to [get credit](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/national-security-council-staffers-fired-after-trump-met/story?id=120452752) for a recent purge of national security staff, called for the nomination to be revoked, citing what she says is [evidence](https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/1920584646292877482) that Means had been vaccinated against COVID-19 as proof of her unfitness.
