"Declaration of Broken Contract:The social contract has been broken.We,¬†the People, are no longer being protected by the government as required by the United States Constitution. The sacred promise of representation (Article I, Section 2), due process (Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments), and equal protection under the law (Fourteenth Amendment) has been violated.When leaders defy constitutional limits, disregard judicial authority, and use public funds to abuse, neglect, or silence the governed, the moral and legal legitimacy of their authority [collapses.In](http://collapses.In) this condition, taxation becomes exploitation, a direct violation of the founding American principle:‚ÄúNo taxation without representation.‚ÄùThis principle, enshrined in the Declaration of Independence and echoed in the Petition Clause of the First Amendment, affirms the right of citizens to withhold consent when governmental legitimacy is lost through systemic violation of the Constitution.Therefore, we assert that We the People cannot be compelled to fund a system that no longer honors its constitutional duties. To do so would be to participate in our own oppression, and further enable the erosion of our liberties.Until justice is restored, representation honored, and constitutional protections upheld, we reserve under our First Amendment rights, the right to withhold consent, demand redress, and pursue all lawful means of restoring a government that serves its people.LIBERTY OR NOTHING AT ALL1. Violation of Due Process Rights (Fifth & Fourteenth Amendments)What Happened:U.S. citizens have been wrongfully detained and deported without legal hearings or access to counsel.Examples:VML, a 2-year-old U.S. citizen, deported to Honduras.4-year-old cancer patient, U.S. citizen, deported with family.Kilmar Abrego Garcia, deported in defiance of court order.2. Violation of Equal Protection (Fourteenth Amendment)What Happened:Citizens of specific ethnic or national backgrounds disproportionately targeted for deportation or data surveillance.Why It‚Äôs a Violation:Equal protection requires non-discriminatory application of law and policy.3. Illegal Disclosure of Personal and Financial Data (Privacy Act of 1974 & Fourth Amendment)What Happened:Elon Musk‚Äôs Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) accessed IRS and Treasury data (SSNs, bank info) without legal basis.Why It‚Äôs a Violation:The Privacy Act prohibits disclosure of personal records without consent or proper authorization.4. Violation of ‚ÄúNo Taxation Without Representation‚Äù (Founding Principle; First Amendment Petition Clause)What Happened:Citizens are being taxed by a government failing to uphold constitutional duties (representation, due process, protection).Why It‚Äôs a Violation:Taxation becomes exploitative when representation and protection under law are denied.5. Suppression of Redress and Petition (First Amendment)What Happened:Citizens who speak out or file complaints about these abuses face delays, dismissal, or retaliation blocking their constitutional right to seek redress.Why It‚Äôs a Violation:The First Amendment protects the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances.We are quite literally living in tyranny",These-Photo-5731,2025-05-09T13:58:29,0
