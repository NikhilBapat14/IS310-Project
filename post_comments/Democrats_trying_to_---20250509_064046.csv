It is simple math take the cost of the item and divide it in half.  100% tariff is twice the price.  The important thing to remember is any tariff is a tax on the consumer.

This is good for a multitude of reasons first of all if you want to consider the political fallout of this that's great but the other key point here that seems to be overlooked on a lot of aspects is that when prices go up because of inflation or tariffs or anything else they don't come back down usually.   Having this quantifier will help identify that because there is quite a few businesses that are trying to leverage these tariffs and inflation to price gouge with no actual ramifications from those tariffs they just want to make more money.

"Not really. The companies pay the tariffs at the time they accept goods imported and pass them onto the customer. Very different than sales taxes which the companies don't pay any of it at all and the customer pays at the time of purchase.   If no one buys the product, the companies still paid tariffs ",VietOne,2025-05-09T09:09:18,-1
"We don't show material costs and labor do we?  I get it man.  Actual taxes have downstream things you need to do with it, the tariffs are informational.  Its not like we can claim tariffs on our taxes like sales tax. So all you are doing is putting additional burden on retailers.  Fine for the big gues but now ever Shopify shop is forced to display their tariffs.  Then what regulation would you put around it?  Penalties if incorrect?  What if the tariffs shift in percentage like they have been doing?  Now they have to keep a table that is updated for all their products?    Again, if retailers want to do it, Trump shouldn't be threatening them but we shouldn't be forcing every mom and pop to just because you want to show the impact without any follow-up.",MrBrawn,2025-05-09T09:16:26,-13

"Sounds like somebody’s listened to a little too much Fox News. We have had great partnerships with China for 30+ years. The most major instability in all that time happened in the last 3 months and is 100% attributable to one man. One very stupid man, who also happens to be a fascist.   I’ve been in business with China for over 10 years. I’ll tell it to you straight. We handed China our manufacturing in the 90’s, starting with agreements like NAFTA and it ain’t coming back.  If we were smart as a country, we should have held on to high-tech manufacturing, and continued to push R&D. China did just that, and basically left us behind.   There is literally no way to bring those jobs back here now. It’s a pipe dream. I’ve tried multiple times just to have my simple products manufactured here. We are not small-business friendly here in the US. We literally let the corporate giants submit legislation that THEY WROTE directly to our legislators. Mostly Republicans. They literally write their own laws. They ARE the deep state the MAGA morons are so scared of. All the billionaires Trump picked for his cabinet and all those other billionaires he surrounded himself with at the inauguration, THAT’S the goddamned deep state. It could hardly be more obvious.  Anyway, China’s middle class is exploding like ours did In the 50’s and soon many of those jobs are going to get priced out of China. Many already have, but they’ve got a lock on high tech manufacturing. They’re able to manufacture things we can’t. It would take us 10 years just to build out the infrastructure.   If you haven’t noticed, our middle class is taking a beating. Is that what you want?  Trump handed China another massive win with his moronic trade policies, because he was too stupid to consider that China might tell him to go fuck himself. It didn’t help that JD called them a bunch of peasants the day before. Vice President Moron can’t not shove his big clown shoe in his mouth everywhere he goes.   As if to underline the right wing’s complete failure to see China for what they are, our own leaders fail to see it either. China is not a nation of peasants. In fact, their infrastructure in general puts us to shame.   Here in the US, we’ve been struggling for years to build the first couple hundred miles of high-speed rail. China already has 25,000 miles of high speed rail.  Trump basically handed them the keys to the castle while burning all the bridges with our allies. His isolationism is absolutely, positively, beyond the shadow of a doubt, going to hurt our economy and us regular folks a lot. And I mean a LOT! I know. I keep my eye on what’s going on because I’ve got $20k worth of inventory sitting in China that Trump wants to tax ME, NOT CHINA, almost $30k to ship it here. If you understand the shipping market the way I do, you’d understand how these tariffs hurt us American citizens the most. American’s can’t skirt them.

There's literally zero moral or practical reason to not put the price due to tariffs onto the price of items, it keeps the consumer informed, and adding the difference onto the cost is a minor inconvenience for the retailers at the most.

He’s talking about the tariffs. There isn’t a line item that says “cost of goods $10” “tariff cost $10”  the cost is $20. The customer isn’t seeing the additional 100% import fee they’re seeing the flat cost of $20.,duckydan81,2025-05-09T08:46:26,6
How is raising the item price not representative of the cost of the item?,VietOne,2025-05-09T09:18:43,1
I'm not sure if I am being clear.  Trump should not have pressured Amazon not to.  Just like any other retailer shouldn't be forced to if they don't want to.  It serves no practical purpose and would have little to no enforcement.,MrBrawn,2025-05-09T12:15:59,0
"It's not a minor inconvenience, think of it in practice.  This isnt a situation where they just say 145%.  it is far more detailed than that.   I make a toy.  The toy is made in China.  Easy, 145% tariff.  I make a toy.  Only a few parts are made in China.  My tariff is what?  The percentage of that toys cost?  So now a business owner to comply with some new thrown together law has to calculate based on an ever fluctuating percentage of total cost.  OK now I just need to keep tariff tables updated BY EACH PRODUCT, the prices can only reflect the tariff at the time or materials purchase, and your table better match your competitor because the prices will fluctuate and you will be in constant price wars.  Now multiply times however many SKUs I have which can be thousands.    It's not like tax tables where it is uniform and doesn't change much.  This is highly subjective by company by product and there is no enforcement because how is an auditor supposed to adequately hold a retailer accountable with accurate reporting when everybody is different.    It's not practical.",MrBrawn,2025-05-09T13:15:03,1
But there should be. Just like there is a line item for sales tax. You’re paying it. It has nothing to do with the retail price of the item. It should be separate. Because it is a separate tax applied as a percentage fee.,searing7,2025-05-09T08:58:58,2

"These companies already know how the tariffs are increasing prices and by how much. All they need to do is take that very data and add a       Tariff addition: $0.00   item to the receipt. That's it, it's simple, can be made automatic and automatically adjust as the tariffs fluctuate, and they are already entire capable of doing so. For online purchases they can add the tariff costs to every item individually with ease.   It's not that they can't, it's that they won't, and anyone who doesn't is either being dishonest outright, scared of Trump, or being strongarmed by him.

Not arguing that - I think if people saw that the tariff was a surcharge they’d wake the hell up -but stores won’t do that because it may be seen as political. Look how quickly Amazon changed once it was reported they were considering it.,duckydan81,2025-05-09T09:03:28,1
