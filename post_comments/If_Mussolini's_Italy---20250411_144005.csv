"In order for Mussolini to have stayed in power, the Allied North Africa campaign would have had to have ended in failure. This would mean no invasion of Italy and not diversion of 100,000s of German troops from the front lines with the Soviets in 1942-43.  Would this have changed the outcome of Stalingrad? Probably not. The Nazis never recovered from that battle and never regained the offensive initiative outside a handful of disastrous battles. The inclusion of the North Africa/Italian troops would not have changed that dynamic.  The major impact would have been Stalin becoming deeply paranoid of the western allies' commitmment to opening up a second front and may have fractured that alliance. Should that occur and lead-lease shipments cease to the USSR, then perhaps the Nazis would have had a chance to stem the bleeding or at least prolong the conflict.  The Americans were also pushing for an invasion of France as early as mid 1943, it was only because of Churchill's insistence on invading Italy instead that Operation Overlord was delayed until 1944. So a buildup of Allied forces in Britain and a naval invasion of France would have potentially occurred a year earlier to greater resistance. This may have caused the failure of the invasion and possibly result in Britain suing for a truce.  So overall, it's entirely possible, but not terribly likely, that if the North Africa campaign failed that the knock on effects would result in a Nazi consolidation of central and western Europe while the Soviets seize eastern Europe. World War III would then inevitably erupt as soon as both sides rearmed.",DKLancer,2025-04-12T07:36:50,23
"The outcome was a foregone conclusion even before the war started.     The Slav steamroller (to borrow a term from the Kaiserreich era) was bearing down on Germany from the east, Allied bombing raids were carving the heart out of Germany industry and even with the divisions sent to Italy begin moved to the Eastern (or Western) Fronts the biggest change is probably that the war lasts just long enough that the USAAF is able to create a mushroom cloud over Berlin before it does so over Japan.",DanforthWhitcomb_,2025-04-12T00:35:10,9
Mussolini had trouble beating Ethiopia and would have lost in Greece had Hitler not bailed him out.  The Italians were a very very weak ally. ,baxterstate,2025-04-12T11:51:09,2
"Best that Mussolini could have done to help Hitler was staying neutral. As an ally, Italy was just a drain on resources.",siliconandsteel,2025-04-13T12:59:25,2

"Italy is easier to defend on a geographical standpoint from an invader if they are attacking north.  The mountainous terrain makes any mobility a serious challenge.  Besides the hedgerows, large rivers and the waterworks in the Low Countries , Western Europe hasn’t any serious defensive topography. If Italy hadnt been invaded those 20 divisions would have been deployed to the western front .  Second, In 1940 General  O’Connor with 2 divisions and two brigades smashed 10 Italian divisions and took over 130,000 prisoners.  This was why Hitler sent Rommel to North Africa.  The Italians were not fighters.",Aromatic-Salt2208,2025-04-13T13:41:30,1
The Italian army didn't have any heavy tanks capable of stopping the allied advance.        most of the Italian army was butchered by rommel in north Africa     what was left in italy were ill equipped and untrained conscripts who had no desire to be used as cannon fodder like russia soldgers are.,RobotAlbertross,2025-04-13T15:59:25,1

"Maybe.  But I think it's possible the air campaign would have continued up to the point atomic bomb production was scaled up.  We might have been looking at 4 or 5 German cities hit.  Would have seen a heavy shift to b-29s for 1945 and 1946 bombing, probably followed by surrender by 1947 or earlier.  I mean heck.  We might have dropped a nuclear bomb on Rome to get Italy to surrender.  The end of the war was coming one way or the other.  Even if a bad DD invasion had cost over 100k lives, I think we would have kept on.  Uboats were getting increasingly imperiled due to longer range bombers.  B-29 range and coverage would have guaranteed most U-boats that attacked in 1946 would have gotten sunk.  Germany had no response to the US air campaign.",Drak_is_Right,2025-04-13T16:32:53,3
"> The outcome was a foregone conclusion even before the war started.   The UK was on the brink of collapsing in 1940. The subs in the Atlantic were crippling England.  If the German's hadn't ignored the radar, the RAF would have failed to get 10 to 1 ratio and Germany's Operation Sea Lion would have gone forward to invade England.  With air superiority it would have very likely succeeded.  You can only fight as long as your people are willing to support the war and with air superiority the British would have been hit even harder than the Blitz.  So no at the START of the war it was not a foregone conclusion. An ""uphill battle"" to succeed but not certain failure since the US stayed out of it until Dec 1941, and in 1940/41 the Germans were dominating with superior technology and tactics.  A number of one of lucky events aided the Allies such as the sinking of the Bismarck, the ignoring of England's superior radar after the initial attack on it, the extreme severity of the Winter of '41 which was the worst of the 20th century thus far hampering the Germans, Hitler pausing the attack on Dunkirk so that hundreds of thousands of the British Expeditionary Force escaped, etc.",Tb1969,2025-04-12T21:06:35,-3
"It’s also the same Italian army that the French beat when it tried to invade southern France in 1940, while the bulk of the French army was committed in northern France to fighting the Germans.",DanforthWhitcomb_,2025-04-13T23:16:56,1
"B-29s would have been largely useless against U-boats for the same reason the B-17 was—they were far too heavily focused on the high altitude bombing role, which meant that their low level performance suffered. The nose design by itself would have largely precluded using them as patrol bombers, and the pressurization system and complicated defensive systems would have simply been deadweight.   The more likely outcome if the war somehow lasts that long is the USN accepts an unpressurized B-32 derivative adapted to the role than anything else.",DanforthWhitcomb_,2025-04-13T23:14:16,3
"> This is a false belief.    It really isn’t, and the fact that you’re resorting to bad history simply confirms it.  > The UK was on the brink of collapsing in 1940. The subs in the Atlantic were crippling England.    Wrong. The uboats did not reach that level until early/mid 1942 due in large part to a delayed decision to focus on them (Raeder preferred surface ships) coupled with the US not being ready to protect shipping off it’s own coast.     > and Germany's Operation Sea Lion would have gone forward to invade England. With air superiority it would have very likely succeeded.     This is also flat out wrong. Sea Lion had a 0% chance of success even with air supremacy due to the complete lack of any sustainment ability on the part of the Germans coupled with a grossly inadequate invasion fleet—harbor lighters are not viable landing craft, and the Germans never even met their own requirements as far as numbers.     > You can only fight as long as your people are willing to support the war and with air superiority the British would have been hit even harder than the Blitz.    This is outright revisionism. The Germans had no ability to hit any harder than they did—they were throwing everything available at the UK and still failing due to baked in doctrinal assumptions and poor planning as far as operational needs.     > So no at the START of the war it was not a foregone conclusion. An ""uphill battle"" to succeed but not certain failure since the US stayed out of it until Dec 1941, and in 1940/41 the Germans were dominating with superior technology and tactics.    You’re verging into a Wehraboo argument with statements like this. The Germans were not dominating anything or anyone, and even that early on were still being regularly embarrassed—if they had the superior technology and tactics you are claiming they would have known about radar, when the reality is that they not only didn’t but were also in the process of losing the Battle of the Beams.     > A number of one of lucky events aided the Allies such as the sinking of the Bismarck,    That’s two statements using Wehraboo arguments. Surface raiders were only good for tying down British capital ships once they were trapped in various ports, and *Bismarck* wouldn’t have even been able to contribute to that because *Scharnhorst* and *Gneisenau* were already trapped in Brest. Ironically, the biggest impact that she had was the virtual attrition that she caused in the RN destroyer force.     > the extreme severity of the Winter of '41 which was the worst of the 20th century thus far hampering the Germans,    It also had zero relevance to the western front, the air war or the misbegotten adventures in the Mediterranean that were doing an excellent job of removing assets from the field that the Germans could not replace even that early on.     > Hitler pausing the attack on Dunkirk so that hundreds of thousands of the British Expeditionary Force escaped, etc.    The only “pause” was because the Germans had outrun their supply train, a frequent occurrence due to their heavy reliance on horses. Even with that they still fought a brutal action against the French rearguard and forced the abandonment of a shitload of equipment on the beach.",DanforthWhitcomb_,2025-04-12T23:23:26,9
"The Germans got significantly more lucky than the Allies. On paper Germany shouldn't have beaten France, without some incredibly incompetant decisions made at the doctrine level.
