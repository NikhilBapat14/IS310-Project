Unfortunately fox news consumers have no idea of politics on an international scale.  Hungary should have been our canary in the coal mine.,jpcapone,2025-05-07T11:37:18,9

"TBH the world always swing between left and right. WWII we have seen how the far right took over the world, and then shifted back to the left and in the 60s can see the left coming back. Then in the 80s we have Reagan and the whole neoliberalism so the world swinged back to the right a bit. Then Obama got elected and we swinged to the left. Then we got Trump and swinged back to the right again, and we gonna see another left swing again.",nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-05-07T11:39:49,2

"He swung what was supposed to be a landslide conservative majority with two leftist pastors losing official party status in Canada 26% in a month, resulting in a Liberal minority government instead.  I hope Mark Carney wore a suit and remembered to say thank you yesterday because he owes his wore political career to Trump.",VisualFix5870,2025-05-07T11:34:27,1

"Earlier this year, Trump taking power enabled a rally of the far-right in Europe, Madrid specifically, by the so-called ""Patriots for Europe"". They explicitly chose the right time and the exact reason: ""Trump's admission into presidency is a wake-up call for the true European patriots to take back their countries from Brussels"".  They don't have words for the US' funeral. They want to follow the same footsteps, right towards their own funeral.",Hazer_123,2025-05-07T14:22:36,2
