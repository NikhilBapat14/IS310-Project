"Lumber, aluminum, oil, and some food.  Also don’t forget Mexico has been a huge “pass through” entity for China.",Unlucky_Buyer_2707,2025-04-30T12:30:42,13
"Lots of lumber from Canada and a lot of domestically manufactured cars still have parts from Mexico and Canada. Some foods from Mexico too, especially Mexican foods.    I definitely wouldn't say anything like 30-57% comes from Mexico and Canada though.",Mountain_Man_88,2025-04-30T11:41:09,31
"It isn't just Red States, to think only Red States import certain products is just a red herring.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-30T11:24:20,52
As if red states import different things than blue states do. ,Iamstillhere44,2025-04-30T11:29:05,43
Coping and / or seething and if they can point out something negative or negatively effecting red states or republicans in general they get all hot and bothered about it.  Kind of sad really but it’s all they have,chillthrowaways,2025-04-30T13:13:30,6

"The lumber is awful, I had to remodel my deck last year and got a lot of Canadian wood and a lot of it had to be returned because it was messed up and now almost a year later a lot of the wood is bad that I used it's warping really easily it hasn't been sealed correctly it's really bad.",Jumpy-Program9957,2025-04-30T15:54:23,1
"For some reason we import lumber. We have plenty here , don’t need their Tim Horton wood",d2r_freak,2025-04-30T12:04:45,2
Lumber is insanely expensive. So it's not like we are ruining some commodity,Tough_guy22,2025-04-30T14:38:19,7
"They're our largest trading partners though,  so you might want to double check your assumption on the numbers.   They're probably not that far off actually.",Silly-Safe959,2025-04-30T16:28:28,15
"It's a Reddit Herring - they just fling poo like it's a full time job and they expect us to be persuaded by the sheer volume of flinging they can accomplish.  This site is the biggest ""tune teenagers out"" training I have ever experienced, and I've flown across the country volunteering with student organizations.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-30T11:56:51,34
"Yeah, they keep acting like we import at a greater rate from Canada or Mexico or both than  they do.",RedditPoster05,2025-04-30T14:24:18,3
Terrible stereotype. As if conservatives don’t live in cities.,RedditPoster05,2025-04-30T21:57:17,-3
"The subsidies Canadian mills get to harvest lumber when coupled with their weak dollar means they can harvest, mill, ship and sell their lumber here for cheaper than we can harvest our lumber here.  Ergo, the tariff on Canadian lumber.",Euroranger,2025-04-30T12:31:38,23
"IIRC, Canada artificially lowers the cost of their softwoods with lots of subsidy and has been for a few decades. On top of that, domestic production cost is driven up by tons of red tape driven by ""green"" groups.    I use sarcasm quotes because the added environmental cost to ship from Canada means their actions are demonstrably worse for the environment in general.",ObadiahtheSlim,2025-04-30T12:36:41,8
"According to liberals and democrats, the red states are the cause of all the country’s problems.",Iamstillhere44,2025-04-30T21:51:01,2
as if liberals don't live in the country.   see how that works?  but what are the percentages?,TooHotTea,2025-05-02T09:43:21,1
Do we have enough places to grow lumber that we’re not just cutting down stuff that it’s gonna take 25 years to regrow to the same length?,RedditPoster05,2025-04-30T12:53:27,5
Also Canada lets them use Public land to log out of.,Fattyman2020,2025-04-30T13:50:06,2
And where are these conservatives supposedly working in the countryside there’s not very many jobs out there. We’re supposed to expect half. The country doesn’t live in the cities as well? Especially red states.,RedditPoster05,2025-05-02T11:14:52,1
"Our primary lumber tree (southern yellow pine) takes anywhere from 15-20 years to grow to a harvestable size.  Even at 20 years, given the amount of land we have to plant and harvest from, we have more than plenty.",Euroranger,2025-04-30T12:58:33,6
"Well, to be fair, we allow logging on some of our public lands as well.",Euroranger,2025-04-30T15:44:11,6
