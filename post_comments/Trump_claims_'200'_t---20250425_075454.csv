He's actually losing his mind more than ever before.,ScubaSteveEL,2025-04-25T07:59:22,40

"""I would say, over the next three to four weeks, and we're finished, by the way,"" Trump told Time. ""We'll be finished.""  Well, he’s right. If this shit continues another month we are toast.",ItsJustForMyOwnKicks,2025-04-25T08:01:46,22
200 tariff deals??! What is he smoking???,Sol0botmate,2025-04-25T08:06:23,14
There’s a very distinct possibility that Bassinet or Rubio is pretending to be Xi on the other end of the phone.,ScotTheDuck,2025-04-25T08:06:49,14

This guy is mentally ill. One is clearly unfit for office When you’ve  convince yourself everything you say is the truth while lying through your teeth.,Sarcasmgasmizm,2025-04-25T08:50:21,5
"Yeah, we saw the chart. Having Tariff deals does not make them good deals. They're terrible.",localistand,2025-04-25T07:57:34,4
"OK, why hasn't he reduced tariffs on any country? Because he is lying as usual.     He is a compulsive liar.. He says what he thinks makes him look good,,,it only confirms his incompetence and should be impeached once again.",SAJ-13,2025-04-25T08:36:29,5

"So, claim the countries made deals with him so when he lowers the tariffs it will look like it was because of his negotiating ""skills"", not because he was bowing to pressure.  On a side-note: 200 countries?",withac2,2025-04-25T09:08:35,2
200 is more than the total count of independent states per the US State Department: 197.   https://www.state.gov/independent-states-in-the-world/  I guess he got those penguins to come to the table after all.,genoux_pieds,2025-04-25T09:17:43,2
"  Yes, I confirm! In the past 10 days he placed 100 phone orders on Panda Express (China trade deals), 50 orders with Kura Sushi (Trade deals with Japan), 50 with Taco Bells (Mexican trade deals); he is not a liar, I swear!!! What a buffoon!!!",True_Let_2007,2025-04-25T09:32:28,2

He's lying. Of course.,Traditional-Level-96,2025-04-25T08:48:39,1

Ive said it in another thread. But im convinced his Aids are pretending to be world leaders on the phone and playing softball to give him the illusion of winning.,jdspinkpanther,2025-04-25T14:43:23,1
"Nah, he's the same idiot as last time. The difference is people stopped him from making excessively stupid decisions last term, and those people are gone now. So now he's boxed in, and his only strategy is to lie about everything and blame someone else for his own bad decisions.",Simmery,2025-04-25T08:26:02,18

They are less than 200 countries in the world .. so who is he signing tariff deals with?,jimmygee2,2025-04-25T09:50:58,2
"He paused most of the tariffs he put in place on “Liberation Day” for 90 days.  He is claiming to have made deals so he can ‘get a win’ and hopefully not destroy our economy further.    Pretty sure he still has the tariffs on Canada and Mexico, though.  Hope he can get over that shit soon.",DramaticWesley,2025-04-25T08:56:59,1
"Actually, all 200 deals are with various penguins on the island. He's playing them all against each other to prop up the biggest, strongest, manliest penguin to rule over it under Trump's direction.",dbkenny426,2025-04-25T08:54:59,6
