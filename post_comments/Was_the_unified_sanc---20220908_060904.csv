"I mean, I'm not sure what you mean by ""precedent."" There is no binding legal requirement or even influence that one sanctions action has on a future action. If you ask instead if it's meant to ""send a message"" then I would say of course yes. The whole point of an alliance like NATO is that by challenging one, you challenge all. It would be a pretty crappy alliance if that didn't happen. Yes, very much part of the idea of applying sanctions is to communicate to countries that don't have sanctions that they REALLY don't want to do anything that would result in them getting sanctions.",mormagils,2022-09-08T09:23:32,10
"“Go against the international community”? That’s a weird way of phrasing it. The sanctions effort is a very natural response to a country invading its neighbor, unprovoked, in a war of aggression that has committed numerous atrocities. Most of the sanctions come from countries nearby the war itself (the EU, NATO states, etcetera). In terms of precedent this is really following through on previous sanctions placed on states committing egregious atrocities or invasions (Gulf War, Yugoslavia, etcetera).",dunpyklungo,2022-09-09T07:11:15,2

"Yes I get that, but the question seemed to be about why sanctions are often applied by many countries at once. Maybe I misunderstood the question.",mormagils,2022-09-08T22:57:22,1
