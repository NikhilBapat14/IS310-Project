"From the editorial:  > Behind the slogans and tariffs lies a calculated strategy – fuelled by elite interests, eroding labour rights and stoking global recession >  > . . . >  > Maga protectionism isn’t rebuilding US industry – it’s shock therapy. Mr Trump engineers a trade crisis to hike prices, kill off “uncompetitive” firms and clear the way for a leaner, capital-heavy economy. Meanwhile, tax cuts hand America’s oligarchic tendency even more power to reshape markets in its image. Mr Trump’s narrative promises a revival for US workers – particularly the unionised holdouts in places such as Detroit – but what they will get is higher costs, stagnant wages and patriotic slogans. This isn’t industrial policy. It’s class politics disguised as economic nationalism – a controlled demolition of what remains of US labour’s bargaining power, sold as a populist renaissance.",zsreport,2025-05-06T05:47:25,21
It's ok they will have jobs in America in about 3 years.  Until then good luck navigating our unemployment system and just living comfortably in general.  This administration means to make America pay for Trump's 2020 loss and for all those unfavorable polls.  Literally pay and then cut and run when they have bled us dry.  ,arilupe,2025-05-06T05:51:58,8
In the meantime everyone should have understood it. The government doesn't care who suffers from their politics. The main thing is that the Trump clan can make money.,Spirited-Top3307,2025-05-06T05:59:27,5
