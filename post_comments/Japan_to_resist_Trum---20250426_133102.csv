""If you get mugged and put money in their hands, they will come back to mug us.""  >Oguma called Trump's tariff formula ""a mess"" and questioned if it was ""safe for a serious person to go there"" and negotiate with the U.S.  >""Consider every option, but you should never make concessions to someone who is not straight up anyway,"" Oguma said, adding: ""I hope that you will never give in to the American extortionists. I know this is harsh to say, but they are extortionists.""  >""If you listen to what they say, it will be a really bad example,"" Oguma said.  >Iwaya meanwhile has called for a diplomatic approach to the still-developing U.S. trade policy, comparing the regular changes to ""a daily menu.""

"Good for Japan for pushing back against Trump.  If Trump weren't so belligerent and had some tact and diplomacy, he would be able to get a lot more done in a host of ways across the board.  But, he is who he is, and with that, other countries don't want to be on board with him.  That said, Japan does need to play along with us as we are their security ally.  The largest US overseas presence is in Japan so yes, Japan will be mindful of all of this, as they tend to be.",Smithy2232,2025-04-26T13:45:47,6

"> But any demands from Washington on Tokyo to downgrade its economic relationship with China would potentially deal Japan a major economic blow. > ""It’s going to be really, really bad for Japan if it sees a drop in trade both with the U.S. and China,” said Yu Uchiyama, a professor of political science at the University of Tokyo.

> Japan does need to play along with us as we are their security ally.  Not necessarily. Japan holds more American debt than any country in the world. A massive sell-off of those t-bills and the US would have a pretty significant problem on its hands.,biscuitarse,2025-04-26T18:31:10,3

I mean you could boil that down to in the long run you can't trust anyone if they're one conservative election away from destroying your entire relationship. China in short and long term are more trustworthy than the US on basically every front. But that's not a particularly high bar because a majority of the world falls under that category.,ariasingh,2025-04-26T16:07:20,8
