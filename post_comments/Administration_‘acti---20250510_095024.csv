"I thought they were actively looking at a monkey's ass. They would need congress, and I'd hope there would be more than a few republicans that have a problem with this.",NoReserve7293,2025-05-10T10:00:15,11
Or they'll just do it anyway. Crazy how America got taken out by the most incompetent group of people imaginable. Good luck with Supreme Court Justice Steven Miller,GiftedOaked,2025-05-10T10:15:54,1

I need r/law ‘s opinion on this before politics.,Dangerous-Coconut-49,2025-05-10T16:08:55,1
I doubt that but I like your optimism ,Decent-Friend7996,2025-05-10T10:26:10,1
They have congress,gl4ssm1nd,2025-05-10T10:13:05,1
Technically they need Congress. But Lincoln suspended it during the Civil War over the objection of the chief justice. It was eventually retroactively okayed by Congress. I am skeptical that enough congressional Republicans would have the balls to buck Trump if he tries this.,John-Farson,2025-05-10T10:07:12,1
">They would need congress  I keep seeing people say this kind of thing, and yet the fact he's not allowed to do something never actually stands in his way.",SpoppyIII,2025-05-10T13:18:48,1
I doubt that. They're all terrified and afraid of opposing any of the orange king's ideas,Deep-Ad9239,2025-05-10T10:26:41,1

That’s not how it works.,ElderSmackJack,2025-05-10T13:20:42,1
"None of what's going on right now is how anything works.  Trump keeps steamrolling right through judicial orders and through all of the checks and balances that make our country and its government function, and literally nobody with the power to do a single thing about it wants to do so.  So materially, that is (currently) how it works.",SpoppyIII,2025-05-10T13:28:29,1
"No, it isn’t how it works. Hyperbole doesn’t interest me.",ElderSmackJack,2025-05-10T17:03:22,1
