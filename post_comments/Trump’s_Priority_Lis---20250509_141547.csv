"From Bloomberg News reporters [Josh Wingrove](https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/ASLqWCO-Zh4/josh-wingrove) and [Alicia Diaz](https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/AVmRlguxhlo/alicia-diaz):  The Trump administration’s first trade talks involve an eclectic mix of major exporters and smaller economies, as the White House looks to rack up agreements that could serve as models for other negotiations.  President Donald Trump’s team has set a list of roughly 20 partners as the focus of early negotiations, people familiar with the matter said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The [Office of the US Trade Representative](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0248789Z:US) has briefed lawmakers on the targets, the people said.  The group includes nations such as Japan, South Korea and Vietnam, all top sources of US imports where Trump wants to shrink the trade deficit. It also encompasses comparatively minor partners like Fiji, Lesotho and Mauritius, the people said.  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said the US is emphasizing talks with 18 countries, but has not publicly identified the full list. That includes China, which is due to [begin talks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-09/trump-says-80-china-tariff-seems-right-ahead-of-trade-talks) this weekend. The slate is designed to establish “templates” to quickly reach other deals, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said.",bloomberg,2025-05-09T14:16:13,0
