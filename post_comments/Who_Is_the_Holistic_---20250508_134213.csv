"***From Rolling Stone’s Nikki McCann Ramirez:***  The United States surgeon general is tasked with representing the nation’s medical community and informing the general public on potential risks to their health. Warning labels on tobacco products, alcohol, and potentially even social media all originate from the surgeon general’s office.  Surgeon generals often first serve as high-ranking doctors within the United States military, but President Donald Trump is continuing to expand his roster of unconventional hires by tapping a woo-woo wellness influencer to fill the position.  “I am pleased to announce that Dr. Casey Means, will be nominated as our next Surgeon General of the United States of America,” Trump wrote Thursday on Truth Social. “Casey has impeccable “MAHA” credentials, and will work closely with our wonderful Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.”  “Her academic achievements, together with her life’s work, are absolutely outstanding. Dr. Casey Means has the potential to be one of the finest Surgeon Generals in United States History,” the president added.  In reality, Means’ credentials as a medical professional are quite questionable, and much of her career has been dedicated to the promotion of pseudoscientific bunk and her own products and writing.  Here’s everything you need to know about the woman who will potentially be America’s next top doctor: [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/who-is-casey-means-trump-pick-surgeon-general-1235334485/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/who-is-casey-means-trump-pick-surgeon-general-1235334485/)",rollingstone,2025-05-08T13:52:37,6

"You should add that she ""quit"" in the last 6 months of her 6th year of a 5 year residency.  That normally implies that the person was ""allowed"" to quit rather than be fired.    Being a year behind already shows there were concerns about her ability to safely practice medicine, the fact that she didn't finish the residency all but confirms she removed for not being able to safely treat patients.  Residencies do their academic review of residents around the 6 month mark.  She was found to be inadequate and removed. Unfortunately, most programs allow their residents to quit to save face rather than get the stigma of removal.",Yuv_Kokr,2025-05-08T14:06:31,7
