"OK. And so the rest of the slippery slope begins to be slid down.  He is establishing precedent. If young Latino children with citizenship can be deported, why not older citizens.  Also, if young Latino citizens are being deported because one or more of their parents is classified as an illegal immigrant,  perhaps birthright citizenship should be reconsidered.  But hey, you'll be able to tell people you're  old enough to remember American democracy.",dkorabell,2025-04-25T23:37:54,38

Every single person in the Trump administration needs to be removed from office immediately for aggressively violating the US Constitution. They‚Äôve deported American citizens - children.   They need to be removed by any means necessary if we‚Äôre going to save our democracy.,RyanCdraws,2025-04-26T12:41:29,2

"Well, that ‚Äûactively resists moving in that direction‚Äú should be worded carefully. 20 percent of Germans voted for the AfD, which is an openly racist, revisionist and actually generally misanthropic party. The AfD is basically only semantically distinguishable from the Republicans and that is also dwindling. In addition, the conservative CDU/CSU has tried to take voters away from the AfD by simply adopting its policies and, in some cases, its language. That is 28 percent in favor of the CDU/CSU. That makes 48 percent of people who actively support Trumpian policies or at least don't have a bigger problem with them.",drmanhattanmar,2025-04-27T04:34:03,1
