Scotus did an enormous amount of damage too . He should have never been allowed to run again after January 6 but scotus delayed their decision to purposely protect him and then kicked back 14-3 knowing Congress would never agree to remove him.  And 14-3 was written into law to specifically protect us from someone like Trump.,Riversmooth,2025-04-07T01:19:50,127

"I blame them, but thinking back, I think the biggest problem were democrats right after Jan 6 happened.  I remember a lot of the Republicans said it was wrong, and that's not how we run this country.  The Democrats agreed, then did nothing.  They let Fox News and MAGA take the narrative and make it what they wanted for a few says. The Democrats on Jan 7 should have jailed him then, all the protestors and the couple of senators and congressmen that supported him.  Then they should have tried the main people fortreason and we wouldn't be where we are at.

"Unfortunately, we have seen this scenario play out many times in history in other countries, where people become enamored with a personality and fail to recognize the evil operating behind it. Some, like DJT, Chavez, Putin, put up a facade of protecting us from domestic and foreign enemies, while operating a mafia-like money-making machine behind the scenes. And just like in Venezuela and Russia, politicians who disagree in the US are afraid to speak out for fear of being targeted, both politically and physically. Probably the weakest link in our society right now is an activist majority on the SCOTUS. That could outlive the current evil running the WH and the majorities in Congress.  DJT's greed is far greater than his intelligence. There are some pretty evil people directing his political policies and operating his informal financial operations. It's hard to say whether someone will be capable of filling the void once he fades out. Clearly Vance does not have the personality to command the same popular following.

Then Mitch McConnell refused to do a real trial in the Senate with witnesses, and told the Senate Republicans to vote against his removal.

On Jan. 7, they were both under Trump's control and that's why no one was arrested or removed from office.
