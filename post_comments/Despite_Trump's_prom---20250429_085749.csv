"It was never about saving money. It’s about punishing people they don’t like,l and getting rid of oversight. If Musk fires people that would investigate his businesses or deny government contracts then he wins.

If responsible, law abiding government employees are gone, they can do whatever they want.",black_flag_4ever,2025-04-29T09:07:16,184
