I don't want Ukraine's minerals. I just want to help them because it's the human thing to do.,No-Group-4504,2025-04-30T19:52:35,30
"I don't see how this deal ""solidifies investment in Kyiv‚Äôs defense""  is there text in the deal that says that?",JaVelin-X-,2025-04-30T19:52:12,6
"As much as most of like to bash on Trump this was a good move for Ukraine‚Äôs sovereignty. Think of it like this, American infrastructure will be developed that co-exists with Ukrainian-mines for these minerals.   If Russia interferes, which they likely will. This will force trumps hand.",SOSXrayPichu,2025-04-30T21:52:10,2
What do you think.  8 days before Trump is in open violation of the agreement?,obligatorythr0waway,2025-05-01T00:07:30,1
"Most of Ukraine‚Äôs mineral data comes from old Soviet surveys, and many deposits are in Russian-occupied zones. Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they turn out to be not economically worth the effort.",Agitated-Ad-504,2025-05-01T07:22:36,1
This is largely performative on the u.s side I guess.,coatofforearm,2025-04-30T19:55:56,2
"The most meaningless deal ever, but Ukraine has to placate Trump's ego for now. He's convinced that his dumb ideas are great and is incapable of self-reflection.",LetsgoRoger,2025-04-30T19:56:04,0
We'll see about that...¬†,StrangerFew2424,2025-04-30T19:45:13,1
"The article has nothing with reality. Zele sold the country for the war he can‚Äôt win, that‚Äôs it. He could save the resources, men, territories in 2019, but lost everything and it‚Äôs not even the end.",MaryUwUJane,2025-05-01T00:04:39,0
This is awesome news.,TedriccoJones,2025-04-30T19:48:09,-5
I‚Äôll take accidentally doing the right thing over not doing it at all.   Now let‚Äôs see if Trump honors his deal. He‚Äôs not got a good track record.,thedoofimbibes,2025-04-30T22:15:03,10
"That‚Äôs nice and all, but as an American, I want to help our country first before helping others.",Equal-Ruin400,2025-05-01T13:55:44,2

Then go hop on the front lines.,84Cressida,2025-04-30T20:42:19,-16
"Yes.  This actually is a good deal considering what I figured would come out of this administration.      Ukraine doesn't have to pay back previous aid         U.S. has to invest with weapons or cash to receive the minerals.       U.S. doesn't hold it's end of bargain, Ukraine just doesn't give minerals.",Illuminated12,2025-04-30T20:27:01,12
Yup. This deal is far better for Ukraine than us since it now ties US economic interests to land Russia is fighting to invade. American can sit back and not provide aid but then they don‚Äôt get the benefit of this deal. So all the republicans that wanted to end the war by having Ukraine surrender or concede land now have to do a 180 and support Ukraine with further military aid in order to benefit from this deal. Overall this is a win but it‚Äôs going to be funny to watch conservatives twist themselves in a pretzel to reverse course.,Playingwithmyrod,2025-05-01T11:53:24,1
"So, what do you propose then? Should we keep giving Ukraine just enough to keep Russia at bay but never enough to actually win? This at least signals that the US now has skin in the game. Will Putin care? Who knows ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è but it‚Äôs something.",Ouiser_Boudreaux_,2025-04-30T20:12:03,1
"The Bucket People, born of spilled paint and forgotten dreams, migrated south for the winter. Their leader, a rusty five-gallon named Bartholomew, warned of the dreaded Sponge Swarm. They traveled by rolling, bumping, and occasionally, being kicked by unsuspecting tourists, hoping to reach the legendary Land of Endless Sandcastles.",SamWest98,2025-04-30T20:03:13,0
"Really? Because just from that statement I'll bet you're the exact kind of person who says, ""America first, I want to help America before we help others."" and then bitches about all the people on welfare and complains when they're going to raise the minimum wage.  Helping Ukraine, helps America. I don't know what to tell you if you can't understand that world politics have an impact on your life.",No-Group-4504,2025-05-01T18:55:07,0
"This may come as a shock, but there are other ways to help",QuicklyQuenchedQuink,2025-04-30T21:16:36,6
"One I'm a veteran and I have been to war for this country.  Two, there are more ways to help.  Three, the Ukrainians said they can fight their own fight, they just need help/arms.  And last, not supporting a country that is fighting for freedom and democracy is one of the most un-American things I've ever witnessed. Seriously, wtf do you people think is worthy of our help???",No-Group-4504,2025-05-01T19:01:32,1
"FYI, I'm a veteran, and I have been to war for this country.",No-Group-4504,2025-05-01T18:56:39,1
How does this make them have skin in the game? Edit a word,QuicklyQuenchedQuink,2025-04-30T21:18:38,2
"Maybe but Ukraine would need continued support to defend itself. Trump is clearly rooting for Russia here and has accepted almost all of their demands. I think he said Ukraine should be grateful that they aren't fully annexed like the scumbag that he is, he simply wants a deal to brag about and not actual peace.",LetsgoRoger,2025-04-30T20:17:31,0
"Neither side has to commit to it really.  Doesn't mean that'll happen, but Trump can announce his deal, then this all gets ignored.  Ukraine keeping autonomy and decision making is a win.",nerphurp,2025-04-30T20:07:23,2
"Ukraine determines whether or not it will extract and has full control so could slow walk it down so that Trump never gets a penny back. The deal is based on future licenses and not existing projects so the US won't be paid now. Also, it's likely that in 10 years time the deal would be cancelled by a rational and less fascist president.",LetsgoRoger,2025-04-30T20:08:01,2
We‚Äôre hurting for minerals because the Chinese stopped selling to us for some reason.,Chickabeeinthewind,2025-04-30T22:05:43,2
