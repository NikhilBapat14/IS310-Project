"Now you got me curious. According to Merriam-Webster:  >The history of [*grocery*](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/grocery) begins with a dealer who sold by the gross—that is, in large quantities at discounted retail prices. A [grocer](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/grocer) in medieval England was a wholesaler, and the name is derived from an Anglo-French word having the same meaning, *groser*.  Can you imagine if he had recited that blurb verbatim?",jaques_sauvignon,2025-04-14T15:22:39,3
