"Yes, the Tangerine Traitor runs away from anything remotely challenging. Didn't get what he wanted immediately, made mistakes that cost thousands of lives and ruined tens of thousands more, then he got bored and has wandered off.  Shameful display.  I still cannot believe he was voted in again. It boggles the mind.",VainEldritch,2025-05-03T07:15:32,10
"So, Trump can not talk Z into handing over Ukraine to Russia. What this mineral deal about anyway? If its for prior arms sent to Ukraine, there is no insurance policy and thus, it becomes as useful as used wet toilet paper. No one is going there in a hot zone to do any mining.  Guess trump will not get a Nobel for his efforts there. Obama still leads you.   Nobel Peace Prize - Obama 1, Trump 0.   Times person of the year - Obama 2, trump 1  Times awaisting trump, you gotta get moving. Obama is still far ahead.",Thin-Competition3018,2025-05-03T07:51:55,3

">Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state and new national security adviser, has indicated that the White House will scale back its role in peace negotiations over the war in Ukraine.  >Rubio said the US was not abandoning peace efforts and that it would be ready to help “if we can”, but that the Russian and Ukrainian sides were “still far apart” and President Trump has to decide how much time to dedicate to the process.  >“So the president’s tried. Look, we have gotten closer … we kind of can see what it would take for Ukraine to stop. We can see what it would take for the Russians to stop. The problem is, those two positions are still a little far apart,”",8to24,2025-05-03T06:40:56,4

WTF? I thought this was supposed to be fixed on day one? Didn't Trump say he'd have it fixed before he was even in office?,mkt853,2025-05-03T09:24:29,2
"Sooo, he offered the russians everything they wanted and it wasn't good enough for them, basically never seriously talked to Ukraine but made ridiculous demands and threw a tantrum when they were declined, and now they're sulking because the ""best dealmaker"" couldn't negotiate a deal after basically not trying in the first place?  Maybe the US should elect some adults if there are elections left in the future?",Quietschedalek,2025-05-03T11:19:59,2

"Not really. The deal can't be enacted if Ukraine is conquered, and can be reneged on if the USA aligns with Russia. No company is going to try to use it as long as the war is going on. It's just as much a negotiation tool as it ever was.  Of course, Trump probably doesn't care about any of it beyond the initial press conference.",barryvm,2025-05-03T07:27:46,9

"That's another important aspect of it, yes. What company is going to make any long term commitment when the people running the USA government are corrupt as hell, utterly unreliable and also thoroughly stupid? Even if they somehow don't renege on whatever agreement you signed with them, there's a good chance that when these people leave office (or more likely are removed), whatever government comes next will investigate and punish anyone involved in the corrupt dealings of their predecessors.",barryvm,2025-05-03T08:00:44,2
"I'll answer your question, just be clear.  Because this is one of the most striking things about this buffoon: that he behaves, on the world stage no less, like a spoilt child - having tantrums, throwing about childish names, and if baby doesn't get what he wants, when he wants it, he stamps off in a hissy fit.  I never expected him at do ANY of the things he said he would do because they were mostly patently absurd (like 24 end to Ukraine war, annexing Canada, etc, etc) - and I was never in any doubt that, at the very least, he would ape Putin, and not in a mocking way.  I dislike him intensely because he is a lying criminal, an incompetent businessman (look at the trail of failed and bankrupt companies in his wake) and is an astonishingly ignorant person on just about every level you may choose to measure.  I wouldn't trust him with my children's Monopoly money, never mind put him at the reins of the most powerful nation on earth.",VainEldritch,2025-05-03T12:17:59,2
