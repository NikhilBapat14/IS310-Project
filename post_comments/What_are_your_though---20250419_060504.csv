"My thoughts? Never heard of them, but from what you describe?  Fascists.  Can't be destroyed soon enough.",forfar4,2025-04-19T18:29:11,16
"I'm British, heavily engaged in UK politics, and have never heard of this party, so it's going to be irrelevant for a long time to come.",BraggisSqueal,2025-04-19T17:06:11,13
"The party is literally dead on arrival üíÄ It's too extreme even by UK standards. Just look at this:  'Yerbury appears to sincerely believe that, through this strategy, he can seize national power in 10-15 years. This has puzzled many observers, not least because the NRP makes little effort to broaden its support and instead offers a startlingly authoritarian raft of policies.  For example, the group‚Äôs manifesto states that ‚Äúonly people of British heritage or lineage‚Äù would qualify for citizenship and that ‚Äúforeigners whose presence is harmful to the interests of the national community be expelled, without exception‚Äù. Moreover, citizens ‚Äúwho refuse to carry out their duties will be stripped of their rights‚Äù.  The death penalty would be handed to those who commit ‚Äúthe most serious crimes, including crimes against the nation and its people‚Äù, a category would include those who ‚Äúcarry out crimes that cause direct or indirect harm to enormous numbers of people (including habitual low-level crime)‚Äù.

"I have never heard of them and think they will be irrelevant all of their existence. We already have Reform as our right wing, anti EU and anti immigration party. They also seem much more extreme, which doesn‚Äôt fly well in the UK. We are far from perfect but are also quite an anti racist country. Even Farage makes a big deal about trying to not let extremists in the party (for example Tommy Robinson). Even if he sometimes fails.",jack5624,2025-04-19T17:52:37,5
"I'm more worried about the party being influenced and marketed by Trump, Elon, and the Russians and the impact it'll make... unless it fails like the AFD tried in German elections this year",gho87,2025-04-20T05:58:45,1
"A already failed facist party led by a australain that syles him self of Mosley and fell out with all the other football hooligans from the PA and Homeland party? They couldnt even organise a protest at ¬†RAF Scampton without it develoving into theft and drug abuse . They're irrelevent to all but police Counter-Extremism units.   And objectivly, no, a group of 20th centry facist cosplayers and hooligans would be a disaster would destroy the country, the economy and human rights, luckily the idea of them picking up any momentum is farcical, they have no public support or finances. The BNP and national front have been trying for decades. The reform party is the much greater threat",Bukowskiscoffee,2025-04-27T07:28:08,1
