no thanks. you don't get to ban a platform just because you don't like some of the vendors that sell things on it and it's cheaper than the alternatives that american companies prefer using.  american companies are more than welcome to open up a store on tiktok. lets keep government **out** of our lives instead of having it tell us what social media networks we're allowed to use.,reaper527,2025-04-28T21:57:52,21
