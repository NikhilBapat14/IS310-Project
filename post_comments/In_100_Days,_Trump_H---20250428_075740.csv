Their cruelty is only matched by their incompetence.,SwarlsBarkley,2025-04-28T08:01:39,192
Incompetence shouldn't even factor in. They are dismantling democracy. They are traitors. Any house or senate members who enable them are traitors. We shouldn't be clutching our pearls. We should be clutching our pitchforks. Full stop.,FahrenheitGhost,2025-04-28T09:11:12,57
Hitler was just as much a clown as Trump is. He wore a whip. People who worked with him said he farted constantly. Being a clown inoculates fascists against serious criticism. Even now as the concentration camps are being built millions of idiot Americans think Trump is just a harmless goofball with funny hair.,Extra-Following-4949,2025-04-28T08:11:36,88
"Benito Mussolini was a clown. Adolf Hitler was a clown.   Trump's record of never inventing, never creating, and continually stealing from others remains unbroken.",AdHopeful3801,2025-04-28T10:32:31,27
"In my view the big problem with Trump is: he is someone who has the skin texture of a 78 year old and the emotional maturity of an eight year old.  And, of course, he's also a massive crook.",crazybones,2025-04-28T08:19:40,18
"The clowns have been there all along, at least since the Tea Party movement - but probably long before. It just took Trump to distill and crystallize into being something so thoroughly abhorrent as his current administration. Many moving parts are involved to make such a disease spread to half of the US voters.",Mustard_Gap,2025-04-28T08:56:25,13
"Trump's admin is a [kakistocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakistocracy).  The Sec. of Defense is bragging about how they've got clean security while discussing classified intel in a compromised, unsecure group chat. The Sec. of Education is talking about using ""A1"" to help teach kids in schools. The Sec. of State is talking about deporting American citizens and annexing our closest, now former, trade partner. The Sec. of HHS is ignoring a measles outbreak that is likely to become endemic again, while talking about putting mentally ill & addicted people into concentration camps as more important. An unelected appointee has been given power to fire entire swathes of the federal workforce so he can hand himself and his cronies government contracts and make themselves irreplaceable to the functioning thereof. The Press Secretary is telling people that it's okay to violate the Constitution.  This is a literal administration of, by, and for the worst and most incompetent people in our country.",InsuranceToTheRescue,2025-04-28T12:07:29,10

You're selling out your country, losing all respect from almost everyone with any integrity, hell, your kids don't want to be seen with you. Nice legacy you left. That's the best part.

It’s the [Broligarchy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broligarchy) in action  The term broligarch was first used in the mainstream media in late July 2024 in a news article in The Observer by the British journalist [Carole Cadwalladr](https://www.romper.com/p/who-is-carole-cadwalladr-the-great-hack-tells-the-investigative-journalists-explosive-story-18227928),RadioactiveGrrrl,2025-04-28T10:34:09,4
That’s not new. That’s usually how fascists are.,RandyMuscle,2025-04-28T11:32:35,3
It’s not new. Mussolini was a clown. He took off his shirt a lot like Putin too but trump is too fat and ugly to do that.,KetchupChips5000,2025-04-28T14:21:12,3
"Fascists are always quite stupid. Mussolini was famously an idiot. Hitler's Peer Hall Putsch is remembered as one of the dumbest coups, even dumber than Jan 6. But I think with Trump there must be an element of outright dementia. Causing an economic crisis immediately after taking office because you literally refuse to learn what a trade deficit is, that's uniquely stupid in world history. ",Frogacuda,2025-04-28T15:53:11,3
"Republicans have wanted a permanent Republican majority for decades now. They haven't been able to achieve it because so many people will act reasonably when voting.  They had to agitate the populace with right-wing radio and Fox News and other radicalizing media in order to addle people's brains enough they would actually vote for Trump.  Make no mistake, Republicans want a Republican dictator.  Many are angry they have to settle for Trump, but in their minds, he's better than nothing.  When Trump fails miserably, and he is already failing miserably, Republicans will simply say Trump was the wrong Republican dictator. They'll continue to radicalize americans, and try again. And again.",NotThatAngel,2025-04-28T17:08:34,3

He has the inclination for authoritarianism but lacks the competency.   You’re spared the total fascism but he’s breaking everything in the clumsy attempt.   You’ll be left with ruins.,Tiny-Albatross518,2025-04-28T11:14:56,2

I think Canada should make a power move a la “The Mouse That Roared”.,Minimum_Run_890,2025-04-28T18:17:37,2
"Don't give Trump any credit. He's not doing anything new. All fascists are clowns. Look at Mussolini or Goring and see the inspiration for Trump. They are also all incompetent because they surround themselves with yes-men and aren't making decisions based on truth. Eventually this does them in. Unfortunately, much damage can be done in the meantime.",ruminator9999,2025-04-28T23:37:52,2

"I don't like this description, even if it is accurate, because it really leans into the same depiction of fascism that is often quoted in reference to Trump's presentation of the people opposing him—""the enemy is both strong and weak."" The incompetence in the administration shines through on a daily basis, but it's probably safer to just assume that there's a mastermind strategy at work. It seems more dangerous to underestimate the administration's abilities than to overestimate them.",film_composer,2025-04-28T12:04:01,1

"Americans can use the Ukrainian saying ""we're luckily they're so stupid"". If Trump hadn't destroyed the economy with his stupid tariff ideas, things would be much worse and a majority of voters would still be fine with his authoritarian fascist regime.

"If they’re so incompetent why do they continue to get away with it?   This is what doesn’t make sense. You can’t spout off about how he’s breaking the law while at the same time calling him incompetent, while at the same time not do anything about it.   Which is it? He’s either not breaking the law, not incompetent, or not a clown. And if he’s actually is all three, and no one is doing anything, guess who the incompetent clowns are?

"I just don't know how we do that though, huge swaths of Democrats voted for either or both of Laken Riley and that poison pill funding bill. And on top of that dealing with Trump at all would effectively require a supermajority in the Senate.  Do you have a point? Absolutely, even with the incompetence the only real path out of this that isn't just abject surrender requires putting a genuine stop to this and seeing them in court. But that doesn't really change how difficult it is to get there.",TemetN,2025-04-28T13:00:40,2
