"Which god? Edit: I should add though, I think it’s a good thing to believe in the teachings of the Bible and Christ. It’s like a historical/philosophical self help book. Is a “Bible thumper”, a better person than the average leftist? Absolutely. I think everyone on here is younger like me and knows religion has been used for power, money, control and war for centuries and every culture has their own “god” to explain the unknown back then is all I’m saying.

"Logic doesn’t necessarily have to be involved in faith.  Believing in a Supreme Being (God, etc.) holds one accountable for their actions. What happens when you don’t have that belief? Well, look at any garden variety leftist. No moral compass, no accountability, no fulfillment in life. No happiness.",rdenghel,2025-04-20T12:54:31,-37
"Theist - Athiest, a state of belief or lack of belief  Agnostic - Gnostic, a state of a lack of knowledge, or knowledge.  I'm an agnostic theist, I don't know there is a God in the sense that I can prove it, but I choose to believe that there is. When I balance my belief in God against the world I see around me, it works out. But that's my gig.  What I hate are the atheist assmunches that insist an agnostic is actually an atheist.",JustinCayce,2025-04-20T20:07:56,0
"😂 if you need an imaginary being to be moral, that really says something.....   I don't have that belief and i have a perfectly fine life🤷🏻‍♂️   Frankly that last sentence is assinine.",indefiniteretrieval,2025-04-20T13:05:39,92
"It’s a free country and you’re entitled to your opinion.  Without “an imaginary being” what was immoral yesterday becomes moral tomorrow. Yesterday: “Killing is wrong.” Today: “Well, maybe it’s ok in certain cases.” Tomorrow: “Killing is fine.”  I made promises on my wedding day in front of God, and I stand by them 23 years later. Not because I have to, but because I want to. Without God, what value do those vows have? Words in front of witnesses? Ha! 🙄",rdenghel,2025-04-20T13:13:05,-36
"Every moral principle you probably have, had roots in religious ideology. You may not have to believe in it, but you can’t deny the importance of religion at the very core being a crucial part of founding society",pkilla50,2025-04-20T18:31:49,-7
"Honestly, if you need an imaginary person to make you behave morally, you're a sociopath 🤷🏻‍♂️   Edit: ""🙄""  I made promises and I keep them out respect for myself, those I made them to.  Bizarrely , according to you, my lack of faith has not led me into a life of immorality and lawlessness.... Can I offer you any one of many examples of 'people of faith' who do wrong?",indefiniteretrieval,2025-04-20T13:22:27,54
But i don't need to be of a religion to do good 🤷🏻‍♂️  It's important? It's not necessary,indefiniteretrieval,2025-04-20T18:37:43,6
"You don’t and neither do I, but it’s not just about *us*. You can’t form a functioning sovereign society with no beliefs. Which is where religion plays an important part",pkilla50,2025-04-21T00:34:29,2
Im going to bet that many fundamental religious beliefs began before the 3 major religions....,indefiniteretrieval,2025-04-21T05:05:03,4
