" It's open now but it's not like there are companies or investors lining up with remote control submersibles to go down 3,000 to 6,000 meters to collect these little nodules of cobalt and what not. It's a large and risky investment especially in this economy for something that might just get changed again in 4 years.      Although we do need to start having a serious conversation about where we plan to get all the materials we will need in the coming decades. You can't get more than 100% back when recycling but demand is expected to increase 500% by 2035 or something. So what's the plan?",therapistofcats,2025-04-27T17:43:22,6

Wasn’t there a “release the kraken” statement in the news in the past year or two that turned out to be a nothingburger?  It’s impossible to keep track of what I’m supposed to be afraid of. Is the migrant train still coming to take my job and my welfare?,Bigkillian,2025-04-28T09:59:15,1
