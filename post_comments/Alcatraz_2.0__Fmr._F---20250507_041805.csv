"I'm all for it.  I think it would be bad ass.  For those concerned about the money, according to Matt Walsh we spend approximately a million dollars every minute on welfare, so really the cost is a non issue.   Build it.  Send it.",PastorofMuppets79,2025-05-07T06:03:43,0
Cost is an issue. Just because we over spend in one socialist area does not mean we can over spend in another.,Narrow-Trash-8839,2025-05-08T11:46:33,1
Agree to disagree it would be a powerful statement to the world that America is no longer willing to be stepped on.   I'm under no delusions that this will ever actually happen mind you,PastorofMuppets79,2025-05-08T12:06:43,1
"Well, we could probably make that same statement with a land based prison, thatâ€™s new, just as secure, for possibly less money.  Seems like a better way?",Narrow-Trash-8839,2025-05-08T12:12:09,1
Maybe I think that a new prison somewhere and some new isolated location would do the same job but not have the same impact. There's been movies made there's lore there's all sorts of opinions and thoughts about the reality of Alcatraz Island and that would make it create a huge statement. There is also the added bonus that it is arguably the lair and enclave of the most liberal progressive City in the entire world.,PastorofMuppets79,2025-05-08T13:14:41,2
