Moab I can believe, and St. George is a legit city with a population of 100,000 and probably another 50,000 in a 30 minute drive so it's 100% expected.   But the other three? They look like Monticello / Blanding (populations 2,000 and 3,000 and I doubt you pass six houses on the half hour drive in between), Escalante (pop under 1,000), and Hilldale / Colorado City which...just google it if you don't know the history they're slowly moving away from, and they only have 4,000 combined.

Reminders for future protests: turn off your phone of at least location (you have a lot of apps that can allow it so better to turn it off)   Turn off face verification  If you can leave it at home  Let someone know where you are  Resist in destroying anything physical or destructive even though it can be tempting given the state of the government. Were at a point where showing up is most important not full civil war with violence yet.   Do take some self defense courses or martial arts etc.  Know your rights. Check the ACLU if you can have it printed on you even better.  Don‚Äôt wear contacts in case pepper sprayed   Follow local events after like city council meetings   Contact your reps. 5 calls is a great way to do this   I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs more but this is off the top of my head,consequentlydreamy,2025-04-06T15:47:26,1

"I don't assume to know it better than Americans, because that's not even necessary to support my point. And, as a side note, you seem to assume that US citizens necessarily understand their own politics better than anybody else; but if it was the case for the majority of them, then they'd never have let a dangerous guy like Trump seize power, right ?  it seems to me that, regardless of the country, most citizens only have a very rough and vague understanding on how politics work, and that's probably why there's a general trend in today's democracies to just follow ""the guy that shouts the loudest"", or ""the one that seems the most honest"", and so on. Listen to the arguments of those supporting Trump in the US, or Orban in Hungary, or Le Pen in France - they are never providing anything deeped than ""I support him/her because he says loudly something appealing"".  And for sure, my own country also has to face its own kind of fascists (both from the far-left and the far-right of the political spectrum), and those guys are using the exact same strategies as Trump & Co. to try to get control of the country. Maybe you should do what, I think, most people trying to defend freedom and democracy should do: study what people did in other countries or in other time periods when facing similar problems.  And Conservatives would like people to believe that the situation is \*hopeless\*, which is definitely \*not\* what I'm saying. I'm saying that those ""gatherings of friends"" are mostly useless now, given how fractured the US currently are. But are there \*other\*, more efficient solutions ? Yes, of course ! Go and teach ! Engage debate with strong opponents ! Stop talking mildly with only mild opponents, but instead go talk with hard-Republicans, those with ideas stronger than stone ! Educate the youth to the values of critical thinking or political involvement ! Actively denounce flaws in the political system of your country, and push forward possible solutions to them ! Stop attacking individuals or play the ""who pours the most money"" game, but instead attack ideas with \*better\* solutions than what extremists are promoting !  And yes, that's way harder to do than gathering with people who think like you, wave signs, and then go back home thinking it was a great day. It means getting insulted, sometimes even physically menaced, yes. And it also means that sometimes, you'll have to tell people from your own party: ""wait, hum, no, that idea is wrong, I can't agree with it"", and it certainly means being ready to take risks at various levels.  The whole point is: is defending democracy worth it or not ? I do think it is, and it has put me in difficult situations a few times debating with extremists of my own country. That's mostly a choice of values, that is not related to a party or a country, I'd say.",kevkilobyte,2025-04-06T13:04:07,0

"I'm glad there was a protest in Elko. That dot on the map looks more like Wells to me, but Elko makes more sense.  I used to live in Northern NV, and I'm sadly not surprised to not see anything in Winnemucca, Ely, or any of the even smaller towns. Some of those areas run deeper red than the south.",Lunas-lux,2025-04-06T00:07:24,7

What specific actions should be taken by people on the left to defend democracy? You used a lot of likely chatgpt written words to effectively say nothing.,I_Went_Full_WSB,2025-04-06T13:05:36,1

"I don't need ChatGPT to write that, sorry. I guess I'm good (bad?) enough to write my own dumb walls of text myself.  And I already listed what I think is way more important than demonstrations to promote democracy. To recap a few:  \- Actively engage debate with strong opposition. I'm not talking about the kind of debate that one can see during presidential elections, where both sides present a view without really talking to each other. I mean listening to other's arguments, explain why they are wrong, how they are sometimes right (because I think that there's always a part of truth, however thin or misinformed), and how yours are better. And, of course, avoid ad-hominem attacks - you are attacking \*ideas\*, not \*people\*. If you start attacking people for their ideas, then you'll achieve nothing but hatred and more polarization;     \- Educate people - especially younger ones - to critical thinking. It means getting your informations from various sources, and not only those appealing to you. It especially means reading those you do \_not\_ like, not only to understand what they are presenting, but also to be able to explain how wrong they are. It also means - and that's probably the most difficult part - being able to criticize the people you think have good ideas. Nobody's perfect, and in politics, there are lies and reality twists on both sides of the fence;  \- Educate people to the importance of politics in their daily lives. It isn't a question of history, of patriotism, of ""making the country better"", that's totally not what most people understand. It's about the cost of food. The healthcare. The personal safety. The work conditions. And so on. Most people don't get the long term consequences of political decisions on their lives, so you have to tell them not to stick to a short-term view or, worse, a ""it's only a matter of politicians"" view;  \- Listen to the opposition and its supporters, to understand what motivates them, and why they are blind to any alternative. Don't conclude they are dumb - quite the contrary, start with the basic postulate that they are very intelligent, and that it is you who needs to make the effort to understand their own view of the world. Only by understanding them can you fight their ideas more efficiently;  \- Stop considering the current system is working properly, and that the opposition is just some sort of ""accident"" that can be ousted, and then everything will be nice again. If the system allowed such people to come to power, then the system is flawed, period. And thus, you have to think about something different, something hopefully better. That's what the US Founding Fathers did in the XVIIIth Century. That's what the Revolutionaries in France did a few years later. That's what various people in Central Europe did in 1848. Were they always successful ? Of course not - but on the long run, their work allowed better political systems to appear and replace those they tried to reform.     So, no ChatGPT or AI of any sort, that's just me writing. And yes, I write walls of text. I guess I'm some sort of retrograde mind in today's world of one-liner-thoughts. But I just can't see myself answering such complex topics with one-liners.",kevkilobyte,2025-04-06T13:26:46,1
