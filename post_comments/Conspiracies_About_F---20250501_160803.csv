"More insane fuckery from the Texas GOP:  > on Tuesday as the Texas House’s education committee debated legislation that would ban Texas public school students from engaging in what the bill’s author, Republican Representative Stan Gerdes, of Smithville, has deemed “non-human” behavior while on campus. Among the potentially forbidden behaviors: barking, meowing, wearing a leash, licking oneself or others for the purpose of grooming, and wearing a fur suit or anything else that is inconsistent with “behaviors or accessories typically displayed by a member of the homo sapiens species,” according to the bill.  >  > Named the F.U.R.R.I.E.S. (Forbidding Unlawful Representation of Roleplaying in Education) Act, Gerdes’s bill aims to excise “furries”—the name typically ascribed to members of a subculture who don large, anthropomorphic costumes matching animal alter egos—from Texas public schools. The bill also bans students from using litter boxes instead of bathrooms. It’s the latest response to a conservative panic over a wave of hoaxes and debunked viral posts that claim schoolkids across America are choosing to identify as animals and that some school administrators are either turning a blind eye or actively aiding and encouraging the behavior. Governor Greg Abbott, who endorsed Gerdes’s bill, has himself helped spread these rumors: At a stop on his statewide tour promoting school-voucher legislation earlier this year, he told a group of pastors that in some parts of the state, “kids go to school dressed up as cats with litter boxes in their classrooms.” >  > Now Gerdes wants real action against what he calls the “radical” furry subculture. Under his bill, a student who presents themself “as anything other than a human being” would face disciplinary action. The child-abuse section of the Texas Family Code would be expanded to include any action in an “education setting” that amounts to “allowing or encouraging the child to develop a dependence on or a belief that non-human behaviors are societally acceptable.” In a part reminiscent of Texas’s current bounty system, which allows private citizens to sue those who help facilitate abortions, anyone with “a reasonable belief” about a violation of the law would be able to file a complaint with the Texas attorney general’s office, which could then investigate the district and levy fines of up to $10,000 for a first offense and up to $25,000 for every offense thereafter. “We just want to help [schools] have the tools to get some of the distractions out of the classroom,” Gerdes, told the committee during Tuesday’s at times tense hearing.",zsreport,2025-05-01T16:10:13,10

"Who the fuck cares if someone wants to wear a furry costume to school. And for the record we know a couple and they’re quite happy to use the regular bathrooms.   My mom is ultra fundamentalist and went on some rant tonight about people in drag—how awful for kids, etc. I pointed out that my little kids loved Mrs Doubtfire and honestly they’re raised that if that asked it would just be that people like to dress all different ways and that’s okay. Why do conservatives think inclusion hurts anyone??  Also not sure she knows that we go to our towns Pride event every year and they’re quite acquainted with seeing people in drag.",Organic-Class-8537,2025-05-01T23:29:38,1
