"Theoretically there is nothing stopping it.  Assuming this report is correct, at least one [state legislative district](https://redistricting.lls.edu/redistricting-101/where-are-the-lines-drawn/#contiguity) was created so there were a couple floating chunks which were surrounded entirely by other districts as part of one district.  Congress could require contiguity or whatever the technical term is to prevent one district being encompassed by another, but I don't believe there is a textual restriction on creating some sort of a doughnut district?",digbyforever,2023-05-09T23:15:56,6
"In the redistricting following the 1980 census, the district I grew up in in PA [had a tiny island entirely surrounded by another district](https://what-the-district.aclu.org/?ids=6717-6738-6757-6776-6803-7453-7483-7521-7548-7573). It was probably about a 30 minute drive from the rest of the district and does not appear to have any roads into or out of it. Its only notable feature is a swamp.",Polyodontus,2023-05-10T17:11:34,4
"In almost all states, state legislative districts must be contiguous. In about half of the states, federal legislative districts must be contiguous.  However, contiguity is one of the criteria the federal courts use to determine whether a redistricting scheme is an illegal gerrymander. If your scheme is challenged and it has non-contiguous districts, it is highly likely to be struck down unless you manage to come up with a truly stellar justification for doing so.",ViskerRatio,2023-05-10T01:17:48,3
"There isn't a specific rule against it, but I also think there's almost zero chance it survives a gerrymander challenge. This is one of those yes in theory but no in practicality issues.",mormagils,2023-05-10T08:48:00,2
"Yes, look at the map of Nebraska, CD2 is inside CD1 which is inside CD3.",dexsquire,2023-05-13T07:12:51,2
"I can’t find an example at the congressional level, but here’s one at the state level   https://wrm.capitol.texas.gov/fyiwebdocs/PDF/house/dist54/m1.pdf",HawaiianNoHam,2023-06-08T05:29:58,1
But wouldn't they both still be contiguous if one is just an island within another district?,weggaan_weggaat,2023-05-10T05:34:59,2
"I guess you could use the 'community of interest' argument? Down town in one district, the suburbs in another.",[deleted],2023-05-13T18:06:30,2
"Yeah, indeed, I forgot about that. However, the district still borders the state of Iowa",[deleted],2023-05-13T18:08:49,1
"If it were a single island, yes.",ViskerRatio,2023-05-10T06:09:48,3
"Right, but I would say that exactly zero states have any area large enough to be a district that's so conveniently segregated. If you could just cut and paste neighborhoods then sure but since we can't do that...no.",mormagils,2023-05-14T01:08:15,1
"This is true, but I still like to think of it as a Russian stacking doll",dexsquire,2023-05-13T18:27:36,1
I think that's what the question is: Is a single island fine?,weggaan_weggaat,2023-05-10T12:41:15,2
