"Detention Centers AKA concentration camps?    How do we have billions for detentions centers and a personal parade for Trump's birthday, but not the American people? ",Lebarican22,2025-04-08T07:17:32,34

That is really going to help the US economy all those farm jobs that are taken by migrants will now be available for our citizens.  I am sure those red blooded Americans in red states will be happy to pay more for their groceries.,HippieJed,2025-04-08T08:18:26,8

We don’t have 9 billion to spend on preventing malaria and aids in the third world  We don’t have the money to pay to keep our goverment afloat   But wow! suddenly we can afford to spend 1/3 of doge’s cuts on rounding up immigrants! I can’t believe that will be what makes America great again! Like I literally cannot believe that will be in any way beneficial,murderously-funny,2025-04-08T11:21:46,3
Oh so I guess isn’t not about reducing debt after all. Color me shocked. It’s about spending money to lock people up instead of spending money to feed them and keep them alive where ever they may live.,1000thusername,2025-04-08T11:37:12,3
"It’s nauseating all this wasting money on imaginary made up crisises. Wrecking lives of almost every American.  I am against illegal immigration. So you should solve that in a realistic way. A farm crew visa, factories near the Mexican border with an easy transport to those factories and dorms. And many more solutions are possible if the government focus on that instead of concentration camps.",DeGodefroi,2025-04-08T10:26:47,2

"Cut science (brain drain to other countries to improve their economies), imprison people (put away necessary labor for our agriculture so that becomes untenable for Americans).  This is amazing. How are there more than 70M fucking idiots? Why did you think he is a genius after bankrupting 5 companies?!  America always had a long term uphill battle to remain a hegemonic power when China making significant progress in a very short time (obviously both countries have major - and different - issues…) but now that timeframe seems like it’s been cut in half thanks to our voting population.",Level_Investigator_1,2025-04-08T13:42:06,1
