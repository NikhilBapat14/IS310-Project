"With compulsory voting in Australia the number of eligible voters enrolled to vote is usually around 97% and the voter turnout for elections is usually around 90-95% of eligible voters  Australia's electoral commission is fiercely independent, it does not work to cull voters from the rolls, it works to get as many people as possible voting. If you move to a new electorate in Australia and forget to enroll at your new address you don't get purged from the electoral roll, you just vote in whatever electorate you are enrolled to vote in and get a reminder to update your enrollment",JelloBelter,2025-05-03T07:48:00,71

This election was won by an ALP government which campaigned well and projected both stability and good governance.  The LNP opposition campaigned poorly and was bereft of policies. Its leader Peter Dutton has the personality of a crypt keeper and an appearance to match. He began his campaign with hints of Trump-lite and their policy development was lazy and ill-conceived.  Then came the turbo-charged chaos of Trump tariffs and all the rest. Trying to humiliate Zelensky in the WH and threatening annexations among many other things made the prospect of Australia changing government highly unlikely.  That the Albanese ALP government achieved a second term increase to its majority is history making. Trump did not cause the ALP victory. The uncertainties and anxieties he has inflicted on the world however certainly must be considered as one of the factors in it achieving a history making increased majority.,iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-05-03T07:43:54,19

"We don't all really vote in our Speedos, despite the publicity ad.  I voted in the Adelaide CBD today. The polling booth I went to was close to a major retail precinct and was very busy, had a lot of interstate people, as well as other people who were still 'local' but didn't live in the electorate.  We have compulsory voting in Australia; and have had forever as far as I know. We also don't vote for a President; we elect local members, and the party that wins a majority chooses the Prime Minister. In practice this is the leader of their party, but many people think they're voting for either the incumbent Prime Minister or the Leader of the Opposition.  As a political junkie, the thing that disappointed me was that most of the people queued up had no idea which electorate they lived in. The electoral officials were quizzing people in the queues where they lived. I was slightly sad that I was one of the few who knew which electorate I was enrolled in (Adelaide, both the suburb and the electorate). But it didn't stop them from giving the conservative Liberal/National Party Coalition (our Conservatives) a big finger.  I'll take the win.",CommanderSleer,2025-05-03T09:21:54,10
"A bit of context here from an Australian: The leader of the opposition party (LNP) tied himself heavily to MAGA style anti-woke politics, to the point where he was colloquially known as Temu Trump. It was working in November 2024 when LNP was poling well and favoured to win this election but as Trump got more and more reckless it started to work against them. Thankfully it seems Australia has spoken very loudly and forcefully in our rebuke of American style politics.",ColdAdmirableSponge,2025-05-03T09:09:50,10

"We have safeguards you do not.  Compulsory voting, meaning 95% turnout in an average election. Ranked choice/preferential voting, meaning there is no way for me to waste my vote, and neither I nor anyone else am limited to just two bad choices. An independent electoral commission administering the whole deal; voter suppression, Elon’s campaign financing shenanigans and gerrymandering are all a lot harder to pull off. The possibility to sack/replace a PM halfway through his term with little fuss - we don’t rely on impeachment, we can do it in a week if we lose confidence in the bastard. There was a period a few years back where it happened repeatedly, we changed PMs when we changed the smoke alarm batteries.  It could happen here, you’re right. That’s always a possibility that has to be guarded against. But a LOT of stuff would have to change about what we do and why we do it before our elections look like yours.",AlamutJones,2025-05-03T17:56:51,2

They were never clearly ahead. There was a distinct possibility that a minority government might be needed - no one predicted the landslide we have now - but even at worst it was a tight race,AlamutJones,2025-05-03T18:55:42,1

I am EMBARRASSED to say I live in BACKWARDS Alberta. The MP who gave up his seat to PP won with 80%of the votes. Sounds like PP is pretty insecure if he feels a need to find a riding with this much extreme right wing support. He really should resign as the leader of the Conservatives. His regressive social policy platform makes my skin crawl. He's too much like Trump.,liltimidbunny,2025-05-03T09:24:42,12

"Poilievre lost an extremely winnable (he's been elected there for 20 years) seat, so now he's decided to attach some training wheels and a Fisher Price crash helmet and parachute into a part of Alberta which is so right wing it'd make Hermann Göring blush. (last bit is hyperbolic, but barely).
