There is nothing that conservatives fear more than a child reading a book.,gradientz,2025-04-29T18:40:00,19
">Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld was a gay, Jewish socialist (in other words, everything the Nazis hated) who established the Institute for Sexual Science in Berlin in 1919, a first-of-its-kind institution where research on sexual orientation and even pioneering health care for trans people was done. On May 6, 1933 – barely three months after the Nazis came to power in Germany – Hitler’s henchmen ransacked the Institute and, four days later, publicly burned its library of thousands of books pertaining to gender identity and sexual orientation in Berlin's Bebelplatz Square. (Hirschfeld himself was luckily abroad on a lecture tour at the time and consequently unharmed: he would die in exile two years later in France.) Those grainy films of Nazi book burnings you’ve seen countless times were most likely of the burning of the library for the Institute for Sexual Science on May 10, 1933.  >The Nazis gave book-burning a bad name, and modern-day authoritarians have figured out that torching tomes is bad for their brands, so you don’t see many literal book burnings anymore. But censorship is occurring even as we speak in the United States, as the Trump Administration seeks to control what information young people have access to through their libraries. The purged books are usually ones about [LGBTQ](https://www.pride.com/lgbtq/?utm_campaign=SmartLinks)\+ and/or BIPOC issues. A recent example took place at the U.S. Naval Academy (an institution attended by grown adults) where, in compliance with an order by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, nearly 400 books were removed from its library, including works like Maya Angelou’s *I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings* and Maia Kobabe’s *Gender Queer: A Memoir*. Ironically (or maybe not so ironically), Hitler’s *Mein Kampf* is still on the shelves.     They want to ban LGBTQIA+ stories, ban LGBTQIA+ experiences, and ultimately LGBTQIA+ people. That's what all this is about.     Christian nationalists like Moms for Hitler want to ban everything and everyone who's queer from ever existing. That's their endgame.      Republicans want to bury us and incinerate us. That's their final solution.",southpawFA,2025-04-29T18:38:07,6
The far-right is spreading like a cancer.  Banning books from schools.  Now public libraries.  It isn't going to stop there!  Push back before it's too late.,Troubled202,2025-04-29T19:29:20,5
"Censoring books in school is very old.    In my youth, it was Educational Research Analysts founded by Mel and Norma Gabler. The Gablers would make a “bill of particulars” listing everything in a textbooks that they didn’t like. They would present their lists at textbook adoption meetings in Texas.    These meetings were supposed to be a formality since the texts had already been vetted by professionals. The Gablers essentially hijacked the meetings and would list, page by page, everything they found wrong with each book. It got to the point that the School Board and publishers would accept all of their recommendations simply because nobody wanted to be trapped in an unending meeting from hell.   Publishers back then would generally make only one printing of the book so these two and their supporters essentially controlled what was in textbooks in the entire United States for decades.",Kyogen13,2025-04-29T19:41:30,2

"Well, except a child reading a book that has a trans character in it.     That makes conservatives melt down.",southpawFA,2025-04-29T18:40:50,8
"Opposition to trans books is just the latest variant. What they really hate, and they have always hated, is the idea of children being exposed to new ideas or being able to self-direct their learning.  The printing press brought the political power of the Christian Church to its knees - because it made the Bible available to everyone.",gradientz,2025-04-29T18:44:10,10
Like when they were teaching little kids to use dildos? Yea if you support exposing kids around that you should not be allowed to be around kids,bbbeaverboys,2025-04-29T22:36:31,-6
