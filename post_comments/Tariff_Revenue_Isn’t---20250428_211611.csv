"Realistically, assuming they remain in place, tariff revenue will probably grow through May and probably into June, probably peak around June/July, and then taper off as Americans cut back and supply chains shift production to the next cheapest option, likely Vietnam, Taiwan, and India.",chaos0xomega,2025-04-29T06:03:05,1
Project 2025 suggests tariffs are the stepping stone to a national VAT (value-added tax).   End income tax and replace it with consumption tax. It's the Holy Grail of Republican ideology.,YallerDawg,2025-04-29T06:51:08,1

Stupidity is why. Pure unadulterated stupidity and over active ego which is unwilling to share the stupid bit with the Trump self.,slo1111,2025-04-29T06:27:19,1
