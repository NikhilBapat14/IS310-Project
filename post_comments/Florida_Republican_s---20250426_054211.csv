">Republican Sen. Jay Collins of Hillsborough County has filed a bill allowing employers to schedule **minors to work at any time and for more than 30 hours per week**.  >The changes wouldn’t only apply to minors over 16. Under the proposal, 14- and 15-year-olds who have graduated from high school, earned a GED, are homeschooled, or attend virtual school could also work longer hours.",Ok-Law-3268,2025-04-26T05:42:45,97

"The future Republicans envision for you and your children is where education returns to a 1600s model where it is the privilege of the wealthy and you are too tired, uneducated, propagandized, and exploited to challenge their rule. Film critics have done U.S. citizens a grave disservice when they've trained the entire U.S. population to need villains to be ""realistic"", meaning reasonable through a specific lens with understandable motivations.  No, as it turns out, villains in real life are worse than cartoon characters. They're born psychopathically evil and self-destructively self-interested with a vested belief that they will be happy to live worse if they can make you live **much** worse than them.",Megotaku,2025-04-26T09:47:14,14

"Always remember one of the end game goals for republicans is prison labor. They normalized putting children into camps and barely gave them necessities for hygiene. They will use prison labor programs to entice these children and adults into working as slave labor. Where their gained money will be used to buy the bare minimum necessities. This allows the rich to get richer and compete with any prices due to tariffs  Trump supporters have tried to remove mentions of the worst about slavery and reframed it has ""good for the people"".

"The issue with hiring minors in Florida is there are working hour limitations and guaranteed breaks. however just because restrictions are removed doesn't mean these folks WILL willingly go to work and risk their schooling. Most places would have 4 hour shifts for HS students at 16YO-17YO and no more to not give breaks, at least with retail.

"Capitalism works fine when it's tempered by common sense socialist leaning policies instead of...ya know...open and blatant corruption at basically every level, which is what we have now. Honestly, it's hard to even call America a capitalist country anymore. That implies that the free market is keeping the economy in check and it blatantly isn't. We more closely resemble a plutonomy/plutocracy/oligarchy at this point and have for *awhile* if we're being really honest woth ourselves.
