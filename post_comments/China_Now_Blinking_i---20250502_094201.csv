"CCP probably will not beg even though they should, arrogance is much more prevalent. Trump is doing the right thing. China is not going to fair well in this and that is a very good thing.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-05-02T10:23:48,31
"No minimum wage, minimal health care access, they work an average of 50 hours a week.  AND the only make the equivalent of $8000 on average.  This is along with many other factors is why folks get their cheap stuff.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-02T10:35:41,18
I say we don’t negotiate yet. Let things get worse for them over there until they begin to beg…,ITrCool,2025-05-02T10:21:44,21
"To the folks suggesting we need wait til the Chinese are begging...that we need to humiliate and humble them, I think even Don would tell you you're wrong.  A deal is an arrangement in which both sides benefit.  There is no benefit to us to humiliating the Chinese because the deal is that we WANT to be trading partners with them.  Can we position things so we CAN dictate to them?  Probably.    Is that necessarily a smart move?  With a nuclear armed country that does not have a form of government answerable to their people who has designs on being a global power such that they feel like they would be entitled to forceably take over Taiwan, the Spratleys, the territorial waters off the Philippines, etc?  No.  Keep in mind, the president is pursuing A DEAL...not a domination.  And for a country like China that takes appearances far more seriously than we do, we need to keep that very much in mind.",Euroranger,2025-05-02T12:03:35,5
