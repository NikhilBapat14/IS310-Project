Y‚Äôknow the irony here is that Semitic people are anyone of Arabic or Hebrew ethnic backgrounds. They are literally one and the same. So they really need to be careful with what they term antisemitic because the truest form of antisemitism here is in supporting the killing of one group of Semitic people by another. If anything this is an all lives matter situation.,VengefulWalnut,2025-04-10T02:20:33,3

There‚Äôs a very prominent anti-Semite (Leon) working right there with trump every day. There are literal photos of him doing the Nazi salute. Why isn‚Äôt trump screaming for *him* to be deported?

They aren't telling people that they can't say whatever they want.  They courts have confirmed that the administration has incredibly wide latitude in handling immigration status.  If someone is seen as an agitator the federal government has all the authority to terminate a visa or green card. It is going to get a lot worse before it gets better.,CriticalTruthSeeker,2025-04-09T19:27:45,1
