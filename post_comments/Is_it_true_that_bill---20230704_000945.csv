"Yes and no.   For many years now Congress has not functioned in regular order, pass 13 individual appropriations bills that were worked up in committee and then sent to the floor for further debate and possible amendments.  This is true under both the Democrats and Republicans.   Instead they pass, often at the last minute, so called omnibus spending bills that are indeed gargantuan.    Outside of spending it is less of an issue, but the affordable care act was a notable exception about which democratic speaker Pelosi famously said we would have to pass it to find out what was in it.",RingAny1978,2023-07-04T22:36:51,2
"Technically true, but not really in practice.  First off, yes. Bills often are 1000s of pages.  But the big but here is that a lot of a modern bill is taken up by legalize. For example, much of those 1000 pages are citations and references to how the bill fits into the literal legal code. Aka: line x of z now reads...  It's important info for structure and courts, it's not important info for determining what the bill does. The actual effects of any given bill are dramatically smaller in length - if you wrote them out in normal English.   And then the other big but here is that members of congress have staff. So it's not the literal congress critter needing to sit down and read 1000 pages. They can task 5 people to take 200 pages each. (Or something like that.) And present summaries. For understandable reasons, lots of people get upset by the use of staff, and believe members should indeed actually read all 1000 pages by themselves. But I'll just point out the senior leadership of every other even slightly large organization on earth doesn't operate that way. I can guarantee you that Roger Mosby - who is the ceo of the boy scouts - isn't sitting down at night to read the full report on the tents that troop 795 set up that weekend.",omgwouldyou,2023-07-06T20:46:29,1
"I'd say true for Congresscritters who have a problem reading, but the reality is it's their staff who read and summarize the bills the elected officials are voting on.   MAGAhats probably don't wish to discuss a great deal of Republican legislation is written by lobbyists and passed by Republican majorities who don't care what's in it, so long as their owners are happy.",Olderscout77,2023-07-07T10:09:34,1
"It is literally true that 'no one reads those bills'. Certainly not the actual legislators. It's not very likely that their staff has actually read - and understood - the entirety of such bills and its certain that the media reported on them haven't bothered.  However, this isn't the problem it's commonly portrayed as. I like to make the analogy ""no one understands how a plane flies"". While there do exist many people who understand the theory behind it, the actual *plane* requires thousands - if not millions - of pages of documentation which no one person has ever read and it's unlikely that if any one person tried they wouldn't understand much of it. There's just too much information that goes into the plane you blithely step onto, believing it is safe.  Which, of course, it is. While no one person has read/understood the entirety of the plane's documentation, thousands of different people have read/understood the parts relevant to their area of expertise. Higher level individuals have 'integrated' disparate sections by relying on the narrow subject matter expertise of their subordinates. The result is a product so complex no one can possibly understand it which nonetheless functions.  Legislation isn't nearly as complex, but the same principle tends to apply. The reason your Senator trusts that their particular clause is in the bill isn't because he stayed up all night reading it. It's because he made a deal with my Senator for it to be there. A Senator who doesn't keep his word on such deals pretty quickly finds himself frozen out of the dealmaking process entirely. You don't need to know how to read to be an effective Senator. But you'd better have a good handshake - and mean it.  So when your Dad says people 'sneak' things into law, this generally isn't true. Someone, somewhere, in the vast sea of people who touched that bill wrote that clause and someone, somewhere, in the vast sea read it. Both of those ""someones"" report to people who hired them to loyally and faithfully execute their will.",ViskerRatio,2023-07-19T08:10:05,1
"As usual Republicans tend to think that all the horrors that can be perpetrated are done by the Democrats, never Republicans. Shortly after 9/11, when Republicans were in control, George W. Bush introduced new, emergency legislation called The Patriot Act that suspended a lot of civil liberties. It was some 750 pages large and the Whips got to summarize it for their caucuses. In a short time The Patriot Act went into law.  The excuse was that a quick decision had to be made to protect the country from terrorists.  The only Congresswoman who voted against it, a Democrat, insisted on reading it herself. She was appalled at how many rights the Act removed that would affect the majority of Americans. I think she was voted out in the next election because her hesitancy and questioning was seen as troublemaking in a national crisis.",MangoMalarkey,2023-11-02T19:37:50,1
Let’s first acknowledge that most of these bills are not written by our representatives but by lobbyists who are promoting their agenda.,[deleted],2023-11-09T03:25:33,1
"The actual Pelosi quote is:  >You’ve heard about the controversies within the bill, the process about the bill, one or the other. But I don’t know if you have heard that it is legislation for the future, not just about health care for America, but about a healthier America, where preventive care is not something that you have to pay a deductible for or out of pocket. Prevention, prevention, prevention–it’s about diet, not diabetes. It’s going to be very, very exciting.   >   >But we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it, away from the fog of the controversy.  She wasn't talking about the length of the bill, or anyone's ability or inability to read it. She was, however unskillfully, talking about seeing the effects of the to-be-passed bill over time.  This is further corroborated by the actual timeline of the passage of the act. H.R. 3962 was proposed in the House in July of 2009. The vote didn't take place until November.",Jak03e,2023-07-04T22:58:16,3

"The bill kept changing, was quite opaque and convoluted, and most legislators and certainly the American people could not know and fully understand what was being proposed at the final vote.",RingAny1978,2023-07-05T17:16:23,1
"Sort of. ALL bills go through a process committee. Bills in committee are when select groups of representatives debate, testify, modify, or otherwise edit the contents of the bill. Once they approve it, it then gets released to the whole body for either a floor debate or a vote.   During the committee process, all members have access to reading the bill, but only committee members make alterations to it. Once one body passes their version of the bill it is sent to the other body where the whole process starts again. In the end, both bodies must reconcile each other's version into on cohesive version.   The final version of the ACA that was sent to the President to be signed into law was sent in March of the following year.  If you're interested in the full timeline you can find it here: https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/3590/all-info?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22affordable+care+act%22%5D%7D  The highlights are:  Bill was written in July 2009.  Hit the House floor on 9/17/2009.  Sent to committee that same day.  Sat in committee until 10/7, where it was sent to the full House for a floor debate and vote.   First draft was sent to the Senate on 10/8.  Sat in the Senate committee until 11/30. The next 4 months were a back and forth between the House and the Senate trying to sus out the differences between their two version.  House agreed to all Senate modifications on 3/21/2010.  Bill was sent to the President on 3/22/2010.   So in total from the time it first hit the House floor to when it left Congress to go the Presidents desks was 185 days, or about 6 months.",Jak03e,2023-07-05T07:46:56,1
"To be fair, that's true for any large bill. Certainly the American people have literally no clue on a vast majority of our budget bill every year. Most Americans lack the legal know-how to read through any larger bill and be able to figure out what it means, or find the cross-referenced laws where paragraph ii.b of Section III is replaced with new text.  The Trump tax cut bill is similar and was rushed through the process as well.  https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr1/BILLS-115hr1enr.pdf  You could make the same argument for the Inflation Reduction Act.  https://www.congress.gov/117/plaws/publ169/PLAW-117publ169.pdf",ProLifePanda,2023-07-10T12:16:36,2
