"I’m not a political expert, but I pay attention to American politics and I wanted to come here to share ideas and questions I have about the current state of American federal politics.  A strange behavior I notice every four years during the elections is how Americans divide themselves into the two groups. The political duality seems senseless to me if America is to be a strong unified country. Psychologically, one’s individual mind couldn’t operate on such a level of suppressing one side or one emotion in favor for another. And so i feel that our political system doesn’t reflect a natural organic decision making structure. It occurred to me that with so much tension between the left and the right, it seem obvious that to be of a centered approach would do the country well. It’s so obvious to me, and i don’t understand how its not obvious to others. You cant be far right or far left and work together with anyone. So why do we uphold such an extremist system. It would seem more rational to allow both sides of the political spectrum to negotiate and compromise on terms and policies on an ever evolving structure where both sides feel heard and supported. And there never be a need for such powerful division and hatred.  I had the toy idea that at the end of an election the leaders from the democrat and republican parties would both take office and perform their roles along this idea.

"Trump has dictator envy. He often says approvingly that President Xi rules a billion people in China with an “iron fist”. He wants to expand US territory (eg. Greenland and Canada) as Putin has been trying to do in Ukraine. He has sworn an oath to the US constitution but is not interested in upholding it and has proved willing to ignore the courts (including the Supreme Court) on immigration. I think there is a risk he will try to prolong his presidency using emergency powers, despite saying recently he is unlikely to run for a third term.

Will Trump overthrow democracy?  I think he’s more likely to try to stay in power if the polls are good (and he doesn’t want to step down) than if support for him is in the doldrums.

If his administration continues to be chaotic and the US (and thus the global) economy is performing badly, Farage’s fortunes may suffer. We may also see more inner-party squabbling from Reform.

The most robust machine in the world will eventually break down if no one maintains it, especially if someone starts beating the shit out of it with a tire iron.   The judiciary has pushed back some (maintaining the machine), but nothing/no one else in the system seems to be doing the same. It’s like the idea of the “unitary executive” is so pervasive that the checks and balances, which all depend upon those other government branches acting in their own self interest, simply aren’t working. Not when one party controls everything.   Either the two-party system has a flaw or the US constitution really does intend for a single party to undo decades of precedent within a year or two. I‘ll leave that to the reader to decide. ",ARazorbacks,2025-05-07T08:30:08,2

"I'm not sure it's wise to separate Trump from Americans. They had the choice of a better candidate who was rejected and also seen what he was like from being president before. There are many who didn't want this, but were outnumbered by those that did.",teckers,2025-05-07T07:12:43,1
Denmark are a founding member of NATO - any invasion would force NATO to respond and may well result in the expulsion of the US from NATO.  See [here](https://incasumagazine.nl/magazine/in-casu-magazine-nr-24/what-if-nato-members-go-to-war-against-each-other/). It’s incredibly unlikely that the rest of NATO would not fulfil their commitments to Denmark.,sprouting_broccoli,2025-05-07T10:11:37,1
Well said. I would say the Constitution intentionally or unintentionally intended a single party which is how so many loopholes are being exploited.,Fritja,2025-05-07T08:35:04,1
"Well, I don't. All my family is in Europe and I started going there as a small child not that very long after WWII and heard lots of talk about what happened. The method to becoming an authoritarian government tends to follow the same course is what my point is. Not that it will go all that way.",Fritja,2025-05-07T10:36:50,1
"This is a ridiculous take. It is wise to not associate all Americans with Trump's or Maga. Lumping them all in together is mind bendingly stupid and not at all true.  The vision of Democracy, peace, truth and progressive transparency that Europe considers its core values originated along with the American dream. It has grown, and create the west as we know it. Allowing a few bumps in the road to throw it all away after 80 years of cooperation and declare that dream over just because the bad guys won a round is handing them the victory.  The entire American experience was based on a peaceful transfer of power and if we are all true allies of the America, Europe and a united, democratic west we must stand with our allies, even as they fight the enemy within.  Abandoning the good Americans now is the exact opposite of doing the right thing. If the entire concept of democracy and personal freedoms instead of fascism is to survive, we must all stand together and keep fighting, not abandon on of the greatest forces for this dream simply becuase they don't hold power for the moment.  We must a face the truth that the corrupt exist everywhere and there will be a constant force towards fascism in every country always. It will always be based on racist nationalism and it will always be well funded.  Brexit happened becuase the threat was diminished and Britain has been abandoned by much of Europe becuas of it which was a great victory for Russia and their funded media and political puppets. We cannot give them another win by abandoning America just because those same forces won the presidency.  We must stand together as our values of truth, science and freedom are shared. The enemy would strip it all from us and we cannot let it happen for the sake of our kids.",spookyjibe,2025-05-07T09:05:38,2
"He won by 1% and that's not counting those that abstained. I think its plenty fair to separate Trump from Americans since America spans an entire continent, our voting districts are gerrymandered to heck and the process to vote is more difficult than it should be for a right.  Even if I didn't vote for him, he didnt campaign on Greenland or Canada becoming states or invading them.",NivianDeDanu,2025-05-07T08:15:39,1
"Trump already wants to pull America out of NATO, so that isn't much of a threat.   If by ""commitments"" you mean article 5 and responding militarily against the USA, I think you're dreaming.",sometimes_rite,2025-05-07T10:16:47,1
You really think the NATO countries would stand by and just let the US invade Greenland?,sprouting_broccoli,2025-05-07T11:36:11,1
"Yep, I do.     ""Let"" isn't the right word though.  It gives the impression that NATO would have options to prevent it.   I think NATO members would sanction and grumble, and not much else.   How do you think they would respond?  Declare war?  Storm the beaches of Greenland like it's Normandy?",sometimes_rite,2025-05-07T12:15:27,1
"I think they would likely take more minor military measures initially to test the waters, eg create a blockade around Denmark to limit the US’ ability to resupply and continue any military effort without direct conflict. They would also directly support any military action by Denmark to regain the territory either with tactical support, weapons, or yes, troops. There’s every chance trump would retaliate and take the conflict out of the immediate region though.  Hopefully there will be enough pressure from other nations to deter him from continuing or, worse, escalating although you fall into very dangerous territory where one accidental misreading of a situation or Trump’s bravado could very easily turn into a world war.  There’s unfortunately lines that just can’t be crossed and annexing a NATO protected territory just because you’re the US is almost certainly one of them. It sets a precedent which is untenable.",sprouting_broccoli,2025-05-07T13:39:24,1
"I agree.  I want NATO to announce a ""joint arctic training exercise"" in Greenland and get as many troops from as many NATO countries on that land as possible.   Do it before the US can show up.  I don't think the US pulls anything if there are already NATO boots on the ground in Greenland.   While we're at it, maybe ask the sovereign leaders in Moldova, Poland, Panama, Canada and Mexico if they wouldn't mind hosting some joint defensive training exercises with NATO members as well.",sometimes_rite,2025-05-07T14:28:19,2
