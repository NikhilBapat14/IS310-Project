"That’s bad, but hot take, the USA could give no money to anyone, and they still would never give you guys universal healthcare. Pretty sure they would dump piles of cash in an open fire before providing anything for their citizens, other than “security.” Wake up, the USA is third world country with Gucci bags now.
