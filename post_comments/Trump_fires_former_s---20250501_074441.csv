"If Trump is *still* holding a grudge against Kamala Harris, fine, I guess...it's of course stupid and childish. Apparently winning an election against her isn't enough to curb his thirst for vengeance. But Doug hasn't done a damn thing to Trump. Seriously - how fucking petty and small can you be to feel the driving need to disrupt the life of a *spouse* of a political opponent?",hskfmn,2025-05-01T07:54:12,21
"This guy is such a thin skinned bully.   And stupid MAGA cheers him on because they believe this billionaire with the golden toilet  and that row of billionaires kissing his ring ,  is on their side. LOL.   So any time he's acting like a toddler they see it as a win as long as someone  ( not them ) gets punched in the face.",SicilyMalta,2025-05-01T08:16:46,13

"**BREAKING:** Former President Donald Trump has removed Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris, from the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council. In a surprising move, Trump has announced he is appointing musician and fashion designer Kanye West as Emhoff's replacement.  This decision is already drawing strong reactions across the political spectrum, given West’s previous controversies involving antisemitic remarks. The Trump campaign has not yet responded to requests for comment.  More updates as the story develops.",redsandsfort,2025-05-01T08:36:05,4

Which is why he can never make the correct hard choice to prioritize the American people over his own grievances. And why he can be manipulated through his ego.

"No, they’ll introduce ‘alternative facts’ to show how the holocaust was a series of justified activities that improved the lives of Jews and others. Like how enslaved people in US history benefitted from all that skill training and free housing.",Galliagamer,2025-05-01T13:03:14,1
"A literal specialized genie could come down and visit him and promise to fix every problem the United States (or world at large) has ever had like no world hunger, no wars, no sickness or tragedy or horrors and everyone could live happy lives without any consequences but with one ask in return: to say Biden wasn’t so bad really  And he’d still say no. Not only because he doesn’t care about those things for people but because it’s just too hard for him to let go of a grievance. It’s pathetic and frankly disturbing, one genuinely has to wonder what’s gone wrong mentally up there to be *so* obsessed with grudges",Lostsock1995,2025-05-01T11:46:54,3
