"> In sum, the US will not get the deals it apparently seeks and the victory over China it hopes for. My assumption is that, as this becomes evident to the White House, Trump will at least partially retreat from his trade wars, declaring victory, while moving on in some other direction.  Yip, sounds like exactly what Trump will end up doing.",WorldInWonder,2025-04-29T12:53:34,23

"It’s not even US vs. China. It’s really Trump vs. American consumers. The quicker that Trump’s tax can be priced into the retail level, the quicker he will cave.",ranchoparksteve,2025-04-29T13:00:52,5
Not just in the short term but in the long term too. It wouldn’t surprise me if we hear other countries looking to China to trade the goods they traded with us before. And then we have left China room to take over our soft power projections.,Demonking3343,2025-04-29T13:17:44,4
"“…the trade war is mainly a demand shock, while for the US it is mainly a supply shock. It is easier to replace lost demand than missing supply.”  The key to Trump losing to this war and demonstrate his stupid shortsighted, toxic masculinity. He has given China just the opportunity it sought - to leapfrog the US as the premier economy.",Catymandoo,2025-04-29T13:11:25,5
We will of course lose - there was a tik tok of a guy in China. How many American products are in his Chinese home? Zero. How many Chinese products are in every American home? A million.,SGD316,2025-04-29T13:17:39,3

That is exactly what other countries are already doing. Once we have deals in place with China and the EU why would we ever come back to deal with a country run by imbeciles?,DressedSpring1,2025-04-29T15:56:34,3

Pointing out that they are going to win the trade war that we started because we elected morons to run things isn't a pro China stance.,batmanscodpiece,2025-04-29T21:15:52,1
"We are still an ungodly huge market, even with the coming recession, so people will come back to sell to us.  You are right about not being able to start and stop at our convenience, though. Even if Trump blinks again, we are going to see a lot of shortages in the short term.  West Coast ports have reported a 35-45% drop in shipping from China in the coming weeks. Places like Temu have raised prices significantly and more is coming.  Trade will come back to us, but it isn't going to happen first thing tomorrow should Trump blink.",travio,2025-04-29T13:10:21,10

"Curious how quickly ordering direct will be, with AliExpress I used to be able to get most items within 2 weeks which was plenty fast in my book, after all this clears though I wonder if it'll be back to the shipping times of old (3-6 weeks).",FlyingRock,2025-04-29T14:01:38,2
