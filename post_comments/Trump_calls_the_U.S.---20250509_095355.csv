"Our northern border is just as much an 'artificial line' as our southern border, but that one seems to be a much bigger deal to Trump...",JimBobDwayne,2025-05-09T09:57:10,33
"Really all country, county, state and city borders are artificial.  So does that mean that because my property line is made up I can put in a fenced in pool in my neighbors yard?",ianrl337,2025-05-09T10:03:46,28
"Almost all borders are artificial. Sure, some are along rivers or mountain ranges, but more are not.  This manifest destiny bullshit is getting real old real fast.",Dogdiscsanddyes,2025-05-09T10:04:20,16

"So the northern border is artificial, but not the southern one?   Hmm ðŸ¤”  I wonder what the difference is. Maybe if we look at the people.",Crusty_Musty_Fudge,2025-05-09T10:59:13,5
"Trump calling the Canada border an ""artificial line"" misses the point: all human systems are abstract constructs, but that doesn't make them meaningless. Borders, laws, money, even time zones all don't exist in nature. They're collective hallucinations we enforce through agreement or coercion.  The Louisiana Purchase or the 49th parallel aren't ""natural,"" but they're rooted in treaties and wars. Same with property lines. Your neighbor's yard isn't a law of physics, but try building a pool there. These fictions matter because we've built entire civilizations atop them.  What's wild is how violently we defend these ideas. The Pig War (shoutout to longtermattention) nearly sparked a conflict because two nations couldn't agree on... a pig and a squiggle on a map. Meanwhile, laws that are also equally intangible dictate who gets punished or praised.  Trump's rant feels ironic coming from a guy whose brand is a golden monument to artificiality. But it's a reminder: dismantling constructs requires more than hot air. If borders are arbitrary, why do we gatekeep immigration so brutally? If laws are imaginary, why do they crush some and uplift others?  These systems aren't ""fake""-they're tools. The question isn't whether they're artificial, but who benefits from them.",CockBrother,2025-05-09T11:13:29,5
"It's not remotely true.  You'd think a big real estate guy like Trump would know about the biggest land deals ever made in North America, such as the Louisiana Purchase and Rupert's Land and the reasons why the border was decided this way.",MJcorrieviewer,2025-05-09T10:04:21,8
"Only a matter of time, before Trump wants to move the international dateline and/or Prime Meridian.  No pun intended.",Marvin_Frommars,2025-05-09T10:25:07,3

All boarders are artificial. And all 750ish US foreign military bases are one signature or act of aggression away from being hostile invasions.,OutLikeVapor,2025-05-09T12:51:53,2

Maine had French and Indian War of 1754 to 1763 abd the Aroostook War of 1839 involving territories ans borders. The Webster Ashburn Treay in 1842 resolved the nierthern border with Canada .Â  That doesn't sound like it was an arbitrary decision over the years.,Fochlucan,2025-05-09T11:20:08,1
