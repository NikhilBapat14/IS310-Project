"Shocker, Trump (who has had known connections to Russia) is letting them get away with everything. Such a fucking disgrace we are as a country",Kindredgos,2025-04-25T09:22:05,15
Yeah really floored that the wanna be despot wants to encourage other countries to accept that invaders get to just keep the land they stole.  Fuck Putin and Fuck Trump.,TheMancersDilema,2025-04-25T09:24:31,10
"Seeing this piece of human trash work with Putin, watch his actions result in the US being placed on the UN human rights watchlist......it's just a real sad timeline to be in.  It's also ironic that Putin said the invasion of Ukraine happened ""because of Nazism in Ukraine"".  Yet he's working with a Nazi admin right now....  I'm from the UK, and Starmer must now see he cannot reason with Trump, you can’t bargain with him, he will accept nothing but subservience. He wants his boot licked and his arse kissed, we as a country should have more self respect than to do that. It's time to form closer ties with the EU and Canada and plan to move on without the US.  They simply cannot be trusted, and they won't be trusted for a considerable amount of time after.  If ever.  And all of this caused in just over 100 days.  Unreal.",PizzaDude75,2025-04-25T09:36:49,5

Do not only blame Trump…the GOP congress is all hands on deck with this.   Trump has just demolished the right for self determination established by the UN Charter after WW2 and opened a Pandora box which will be extremely hard to close again.   Elections have consequences.,Efficient_Resist_287,2025-04-25T09:56:37,3

This would not set a good president with Putin.,TLakes,2025-04-25T09:20:33,1
"I just read a fairly compelling piece laying out how Ukraine is getting less dependent on the US and increasingly creating its own weapon systems.  If that continues and EU States continue to support them then Trump’s opinion wont turn out to matter very much, unless he actively allies with Russia.  In which case WW3 it shall be. ",BeowulfShaeffer,2025-04-25T10:25:11,1
"I think trump has already demonstrated that anything the U.S. government says at this point is not in the best interest of NATO or Ukraine, so with that, I think what has now become our former Allies should all recognize one important fact...just because the current American regime supports Putin's claim to Ukraine doesn't mean Ukraine and our former Allies have to accept that claim as fact. Just see it for what it is and add it to the list of why they should completely ignore trump.",dispelhope,2025-04-25T13:02:36,1

"It goes further than that unfortunately, the damage he's done, and he's going to cause is either irrepairable or will take so many years to repair.  He's destroyed everything that the United States has worked hard for.  Respect, being seen as an ally, as a trade partner.  He has literally destroyed everything in a hundred days.  The damage has been done, and the scars are going to make the former allies across the globe remember this.  Our government here in the UK won't see the US as a former ally-YET-but the population will.  We bear no ill will to the people who did not vote for that orange scrotal sack looking piece of trash who has the IQ of a 3 year old  But the people who did vote for him, and who CONTINUE to support him DESPITE what he's done-those people we have no sympathy for whatsoever.  They voted for him, and I've seen messages from them continuing to support him, continuing to blame Biden-they can go to hell.  When they say ""they're targeting the wrong people""-that's when you know there's serious issues going on.",PizzaDude75,2025-04-25T19:01:46,1
"I've lived through the back end of the Cold War, and seeing all of this erupt, and seeing a Western ""ally"" assisting a warmonger like  Putin......turns my stomach.  Never thought I'd see it happen.  Can only hope he's made to pay.",PizzaDude75,2025-04-25T09:46:05,3
"Reagan is surely rolling in his grave now. As a young American, it’s pretty depressing seeing us destroy ourselves for literally no reason. Well, doesn’t help a majority of Americans are just fucking stupid",Kindredgos,2025-04-25T09:47:44,3
