It's the beginning of some good news. Let's hope we can get him back to the U.S.,WearOk4875,2025-04-10T19:01:19,49
"If Trump does not get Abrego Garcia back, the narrative needs to be both (1) Trump is evil for sending him to an outsourced torture facility in the first place, and (2) Trump is so utterly incompetent and impotent that, despite being the president of the most powerful country on Earth, he cannot even secure the release of one single person from El Salvador.",BreadSea4509,2025-04-10T20:55:22,23
So now we see if the judiciary is willing to do something about Trump ignoring orders.,annaleigh13,2025-04-10T20:59:21,5
This is a toothless ruling set up to give the appearance that the Supreme Court is upholding the rule of law but without actually ordering the administration to do anything. It allows Trump to ignore the order without causing a constitutional crisis. This is Roberts once again doing everything he can to stay out of direct conflict with Trump because he knows what will happen if they flat order him to do something.,DeathInPlaid,2025-04-10T19:52:47,10
" If people don’t get the fuck out on the streets, if people have this kind of “we can just say that trump is bad and evil” then I hate to say you’re just appeasing tyrants. If this isn’t the truth — if this isn’t the line to hold and defend as Americans, then I fear the truth is many people (innocent, and who we care for) will be exposed. Congress can either remove or pass it to the people. But this is beyond unacceptable and Trump must not be allowed to lead, when he cannot even fucking be HONEST  .",Ok_Host4786,2025-04-11T02:20:03,1

"""Facilitate"" a.k.a. make it appear like you're doing something to bring him back but eventually get nowhere and the story goes dark.",SixOneNiner2113,2025-04-10T19:02:33,22

"I disagree. There is no dissent here, it was determined to be an illegal move. Now, what happens next is another matter, but this was definitely a loss for Trump",Rosebunse,2025-04-10T21:17:13,7
