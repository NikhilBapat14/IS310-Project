What do they have on this guy and others? Many of these minions were speaking out about how Trump was the devil and hitler just years ago. Now they’re his biggest supporters. Rubio looks miserable all the time like he knows what he’s doing is wrong. What are they blackmailing them on?,amywhatsherface,2025-05-04T10:17:15,8
Germans love rules and manuals.  Americans only love the constitution/bible/values if it is on their interest. That’s is the reality.,Efficient_Sky5173,2025-05-04T10:47:57,6

"I've been saying maga should be treated this way since the beginning, it's obvious by their rhetoric and by how they vote they should be classified as extremest but maybe even domestic terrorists and disbanded, hell the Republican party should be disbanded at this point for working against the American people for the last few decades",Ownuyasha,2025-05-04T11:55:00,3
The USA should build such an agency too! A non-partisan agency that monitors threats to the Constitution and the Democracy. The USA helped to build this tool and should get one for themselves.,Morgentau7,2025-05-04T10:04:54,17
I think that power can corrupt most people and Marco sold his soul for a discount,Morgentau7,2025-05-04T10:21:35,5
"So much of Rubio’s corruption is public knowledge and he doesn’t care. If they have something on him that he’s actually trying to hide, that’s terrifying.",seplix,2025-05-04T12:17:20,2
"Yes, it's not like Rubio was a saint or anything, but he did have solid convictions and believed in the U.S., the Constitution, rule of law, etc.  Rubio is very likely to run in 2028, and recently, Trump mentioned Rubio, and for the first time, Vance, as possible successors.  Yet, Rubio's run for the White House has been suspected, and it is likely that he is doing what he needs to do right now --take one for the team if he wants the MAGA vote.  Anyways, as with many of them, they are just opportunists with ambitions.",crucial_geek,2025-05-05T18:16:40,1
"I’m sure you’re right, but it’s insane to me that Trump was able to buy out all of these people. Their name, face, reputation.. That they’ll do anything just for the money, fame and significance. The amount of greed and selfishness that a person must have to do this to themselves and everyone in their lives, both family and friends. What weak people. It’s so disturbing to me.",amywhatsherface,2025-05-04T10:27:17,5
"Buying politicians is an practice as old as the job itself. Lobbyists showed how far you can go. Even before MAGA you had many many incidents of lawmakers being bought by corporations or organizations. Back then people just made „before and after“ vids on youtube, mocking these people. Today you see where money can get you. Apparently even in the white house.",Morgentau7,2025-05-04T10:38:44,3
There are a substantial amount of Republicans that are only kind of shitty. You’ll notice that they don’t get committee assignments or much of anything. They certainly don’t show up with jobs at the White House.  You know who else doesn’t get positions in the Trump admin? Powerful and influential Republicans. All that’s left are the dumbest and most crooked politicians available. The more skeletons the better because those people will do anything that Trump says. Rubio would eat a turd like a candy bar if Trump told him to.,PaulClarkLoadletter,2025-05-04T13:42:52,3
"I think it started as pandering to him to get elected, get into positions of power, and now it's changing to wanting to keep the power and in some other cases just plain fear. They are afraid he will destroy them if they don't do what he says.",Haitsmelol,2025-05-04T14:33:03,2
"I get it, but it still takes a certain type of person to accomplish this. Some willing to be a sellout I mean.",amywhatsherface,2025-05-04T11:10:58,1
