This needs to happen. The fact that one single sharpie wielding madman can unilaterally decide to cause this much termoil in a democracy is insane.,Strict_Inspection285,2025-04-07T14:11:27,104
It‚Äôs gonna get a veto WH already says this. House won‚Äôt put it on floor either,[deleted],2025-04-07T14:05:50,102
It's a start.  But the House will never pass it.  The President will never sign it.,whitingvo,2025-04-07T14:15:17,45

"Before you get too excited, two-thirds of members of both the Senate and the House would have to approve the bill to override Trump's veto. The 48 Democrats in the Senate would support it but 19 Republicans would have to join them. It's worse in the House where all 215 Democrats would support such a bill but 64 Republicans would have to join them. How likely is this?",Zeon2,2025-04-07T14:17:10,13

It won't make it past the House and if it does he will veto it.   I guess on the plus side at least a few GOP reps are remembering they were born with a spine.,lnc_5103,2025-04-07T14:58:18,3

I guess a good thing about Trump being off his rocker is that it allows for the loopholes to be fixed (or at least identified and later fixed when sanity is restored).,Heart_Throb_,2025-04-07T14:45:28,2
"Who here hit the streets on Saturday? What were we protesting about? Who are we trying to convince? What do we want to happen?

Let‚Äôs put this in context: this bill is DOA in the house. Johnson will kill it in committee so let‚Äôs not even spend time thinking that this will fix the tariff issue.   Its benefit is simply to put republican senators on the record voting for it.,Mountain_Fig_9253,2025-04-07T14:39:11,3

Good luck getting republicans on board and 47 will just veto it unfortunately :(,Logical_Bite3221,2025-04-07T16:13:51,1
Problem is that Johnson will adjourn the house to keep this from hitting the floor.,NaiveCryptographer89,2025-04-07T18:19:00,1
Not goof enough the president should have no power to unilaterally impose tariffs ever and all existing tariffs unilaterally imposed by the president should be nullified,N0b0me,2025-04-07T22:23:27,1

Bennet is a democrat (yay). Unfortunately this will never get past the 60 votes needed in the senate to come up for a vote. Same hurdle in the house. Wasted effort.,RickieBob,2025-04-07T14:42:54,0

Even if a bill gets through congress do you honestly thing Trump will sign it give me a break and when he does veto it you are going to find enough republicans to override his veto.  This is what the people voted for let them live with the consequences maybe next time they will take their vote more seriously.,gutty976,2025-04-07T14:31:02,-1

"There's a separate senate bill by Grassley that is similar. Gop member of the house is also introducing a similar bill there. They won't have a choice - sooner or later they'll have to vote on one of these.

"I believe that 45 democrats + 2 independents means that it would be 20 republican senators necessary.

Look I get that we are all nihilistic about situations nowadays but the GOP is already making moves to check Trump on his powers.
