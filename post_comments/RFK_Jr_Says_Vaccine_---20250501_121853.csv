And I agree that way too many Americans have moved on from Covid 19, but the pandemic is not over just bc we are over it.  It is still classified as such by the WHO and at least recently, the US government (dunno about today).  Many pandemics wax and wane for decades.  We don't really know what's going on bc after the Republicans voted down another spending bill a year and half ago, Covid kind of dropped off the radar.

"The mainstream coverage of RFK Jr has been atrocious. This clearly reflects the fact that he is making many powerful industries very uncomfortable, especially Big Pharma, which dominates advertising slots on mainstream TV and is one of the most powerful lobbying groups in Washington - with 2-3 lobbyists for every congress person.  Let's take a look at the newsweek article: RFK Jr says that some people do not vaccinate because of the aborted fetus debris in the MMR vaccine.  The article attempts to rebut this with 2 strawmen arguments:  1) they say that ""fetal cells are not in the vaccine itself."" Yes, that's why RFK Jr said ""aborted fetus debris"" not cells  2) they say that ""these original cells have been replicated over time, and current vaccine production uses descendant cells, not any tissue from the original fetuses."" Yes, vaccine makers are not continuously harvesting cells from new fetuses to make the vaccine. Nobody ever claimed that. The cells originally came from a fetus in the 1960s and have been replicated since then to grow new viruses for the vaccines (viruses need cells to reproduce they do not reproduce by themselves outside of cells). If you take a fetal cell and reproduce it in a lab, it's still a fetal cell. I don't think a Mennonite who has ethical objections to harvesting cells from aborted fetuses will go ""oh it's not an original cell from the fetus, just a copy, reproduced in a lab - ok sign me up for the vaccine then"".  So what RFK, Jr is saying is absolutely correct. The media is doing a terrible job of reporting what he says, just like a few weeks ago they lied about his comments regarding the 25% of profound autistic children who are non-verbal, by making it seem like he was talking about all autistic children.  Finally, let's give some more context: as the article says the cell lines used to manufacture MMR are WI-38 and MRC-5.  **WI-38** is a Diploid human cell line composed of fibroblasts derived from lung tissue of a 3-month-gestation female fetus.  **MRC-5** is a Diploid cell line made up of fibroblasts isolated from the lung tissue derived from a White, male, 14-week-old embryo.  Can the debris from these cells be filtered out to only leave the virus? No they can't:  >As certain viruses are wanted in the vaccines, no particles of the same size or smaller can be filtered out.  >There thus remain in the common vaccines numerous other viruses, foreign proteins, residual segments of DNA and RNA, toxins, enzymes and possibly prions and oncogenes. It has proved impossible to remove these contaminants.   >This is well known to the regulatory authorities, greatly concerns many of their experts, but these very serious concerns are not communicated to the public.  [Janine Roberts ""Fear of the Invisible""](https://www.amazon.com/Fear-Invisible-Janine-Roberts/dp/0955917727)  To its credit, unlike some of the other news articles, newsweek doesn't lie about the filtering process. But RFK, Jr accurately represented why some groups have ethical objections to the MMR.",32ndghost,2025-05-02T11:18:14,1
