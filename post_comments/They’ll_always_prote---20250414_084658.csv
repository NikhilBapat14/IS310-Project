We, even as doctors, don't know what is in them. They come to us from a giant company and we inject them.   Do we trust them? Yes, because we have been trained to. But I will be the first to admit having no clue what is actually in it. Just blind trust.   > Banned and somehow barely appealed  .  .  .  Many months laters  > I don't trust Trump and RFKJR!!!

"The liberal is a walking, talking, breathing contradiction of reality.  Claim to want freedom, clamor to have rights stripped from others.  Claim to want truth, consume media that is pathologically dishonest.  Claim to follow ""science"", spew some of the most unscientific nonsense imaginable.  Claim to be about love, shows the world nothing but bitterness.  I see it more as the liberal being about illusions over reality and feelings over facts.

Truth is hard to find. Not enough conservatives are hard documenting it. We really need better archives because the only chance is to *show* them the truth.

No effort is ever invested on the other side's part, they're just walking advertisements. They tell us what TV says and they get mad at us for responding with something different, ***they will never absolutely EVER go back to the TV people and tell them to check their reporting.*** The TV doesn't even ***work*** that way, it communicates one-way and that's exactly how TV's followers expect The Conversation‚Ñ¢ to go.  Then there's the fact that our OPs are a repeating loop of what SNL just said, what Bill Maher just said, what DNC bigwigs just said, what the mainstream media just said, then back to what SNL just said.
