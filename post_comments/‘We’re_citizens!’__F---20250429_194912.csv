"🫂 I feel for any family going thru this. police broke in my family’s home when I was a teen by mistake and didn’t present a warrant until after the search. I’m autistic and it did traumatize me for life, like, they even pointed a gun at my dog bc he wouldn’t stop yapping… he was a small lil fella and we had him in a crate so he couldn’t even hurt them, (or run out the door either bc men with huge guns and vests were running in and out the house) , they even had to watch me get ready for school, and to make a long story short, it’s traumatized me as well and that was when I had to start therapy and medication. It’s been over a decade.   They told my mom they weren’t there to prove her innocent when she asked why they were treating us as guilty. Oh, and they found nothing, but ghosted us btw- never returned our shit they said they’d give back in 4-12 weeks. Lawyer said they probs auctioned it off 💀!  A majority of people we shared the story with told us we were liars and that it couldn’t happen in America. Now, it’s going to happen to more innocent people. We need to believe them. It’s real. And it happened to me long before this mess. It *is* traumatizing, and has taken me so long to become stable… but of course, seeing all this is triggering the flashbacks. I’m so tired.
