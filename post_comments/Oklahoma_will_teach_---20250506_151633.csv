"The current administration's war on education is undeniably reminiscent of how fascist regimes of the past have attempted to subvert the education system, attack the arts and intellectuals, and suppress opposing voices and viewpoints   But don't take it from me...  Jason Stanley, author of *""How Fascism Works,""* and *""Erasing History: How Fascists Rewrite the Past to Control the Future""* argues:  > Fascist politics attacks education to undermine democracy and pluralism. Universities and educational institutions are targeted because they promote critical inquiry when challenging the myths that fascist politics rely on   Stanley describes how anti-intellectualism is used to:  > attack the media, universities, and scientists when they contradict the strong man’s authority.  The MAGA movement embraces anti-intellectualism as a means to dismiss the legitimacy of educated persons, experts, scientists and the media, to assert their superiority and the primacy of their beliefs.   The Trump administration has identified universities and public schools as places where ""radical left"" ideas and conflicting perspectives are taught. This allows them to justify their use of draconian policies and executive orders that grant the government control over academic decision making.  Robert Paxton, author of ""*Anatomy of Fascism*,"" explains the behavior of fascists:  > Fascism seeks to control education to instill its ideology in the youth, ensuring that future generations are loyal to the regime and its values.  > By reshaping educational curricula, fascist regimes aim to eliminate critical thinking and promote a narrative that supports their authoritarian rule.  Paxton also says that fascists value *""the superiority of the leader’s instincts over abstract and universal reason""*  This is what the Trump administration is hoping to accomplish by strong-arming universities, by fracturing the education system, by restructuring the curriculum and by overhauling programs and departments that don't promote administration-approved viewpoints.  This serves to stifle critical thinking and program younger generations to accept the leader's words and the party's dogma over everything else.  Additionally, the Trump administration's efforts to defund and dismantle the public education system will disproportionately impact underserved communities.   There's also Lawrence Britt, who published *""Fascism Anyone?""*, which includes a list of 14 defining characteristics of fascism. One characteristic is the ""*disdain and suppression of intellectuals and the arts:*""  > Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts is openly attacked, and governments often refuse to fund the arts.  MAGA is openly hostile towards public education, higher learning, academics and teachers, scientists and researchers, even towards artists.  The Trump admin has proposed eliminating funding for The National Endowment for the Arts agency, and Trump even recently took control of the Kennedy Center, appointing himself as chair and replacing its board members with loyalists.  The government has also been pressuring schools and universities into firing staff, while educators, administrators and even librarians continue to face violent threats from Trump supporters.  The current administration is cracking down on student protestors and unlawfully detaining students critical of Trump's policies, all while demanding that universities report on foreign students and their affairs.  The government is demanding that schools hand over their admissions data so that the Trump administration can dictate who qualifies for admission and who does not. They're also demanding that universities supply their employment information so the government can oversee hiring and firing.  The government is even putting certain departments under the supervision of outside security forces (literal thought police)  The Trump administration is also slashing funding for scientific research and grants. This will impact progress on cancer research and research on infectious diseases. It will also hinder the development of future generations of scientists.  Luis Britto García defines fascism in his essay *""Fascismo.""* One of the characteristics of fascism, Garcia says, is how ""fascism is anti-intellectual:""  > Noting the scientific progress achieved by progressivism, Britto Garcia writes ""Fascism does not invent, it recycles. It only believes in yesterday, an imaginary yesterday that never existed.""  This concept is instilled into the MAGA consciousness. ""Scientific progress"" becomes negatively associated with ""the left."" Trump and his supporters constantly challenge widely agreed upon consensus while denying science. They even believe that their backwards, archaic views about science, medicine, biology, etc, are more valid than the relevant and leading scientific research.  Eden McLean, historian of fascism, notes that fascists historically put their efforts into controlling information:  > Restricting access to information and promoting conformity over critical thinking are tactics reminiscent of fascist regimes.   The Trump administration is already instituting policies that flag thousands of images, articles, online content, historical texts and even words for removal. They are suppressing free speech, attacking the press, and controlling what information is being disseminated to the public.  Ruth Ben-Ghiat, historian and author of *""Strongmen: Mussolini to the Present,""* notes that:  > Mussolini and Hitler both restructured educational systems to promote their authoritarian ideologies and suppress dissent  The goal for fascist regimes is to shape the ideologies of followers and future generations, suppressing any antithetical ideas and perspectives while promoting nationalistic and nativist ideas.  In this sense, teaching ""patriotism"" amounts to radicalizing the population and instilling a set of ""values"" and ""principles"" that correspond with the regime's authoritarian, ethnocentric, religious and chauvinistic tenets.  When forced to acknowledge these parallels, those on the far right will often try to accuse the opposition of pursuing these same tactics.  For fascists and their followers, they're the *real* victims of oppression. They're merely reacting to a system of tyranny that's suffocating *them*. Equality amounts to persecution, addressing past injustices amounts to an assault on *their* rights and freedoms.  They fail to recognize historic inequities and perceive things like fairness, diversity and even impartiality as threats to a long-established hierarchy.  Contrary to what they believe, their insistence that they are the victims of a new system of oppression is, ironically, a consequence of them living within an unjust system for so long, and a system that has predisposed them to believe that they are victims.  These fascist and authoritarian movements propagandize their followers into adopting an ""us vs. them"" mentality. Fascist leaders tend to rely on culture wars and the identification of problematic ideas, scapegoats and enemies to rally their followers into a patriotic frenzy, uniting them against these perceived threats to their core beliefs, their culture, their country, their hegemony, their very existence and identity.",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-05-06T16:46:49,17
"I’ve worked in the education system in Oklahoma for 10 years. Yes, we do have one. Before you bash our people for this miseducational insanity, let’s be specific about the culprits.   At the head of the class is State Superintendent Ryan Walters, a MAGA stooge who pushed these new social standards through as a “Please pick me for Education Secretary, Daddy Trump!” They were developed by out-of-state people like the Heritage Foundation, PragerU, and that LibsOfTikTok bitch, in order to put in all their indoctrination and take out the liberal kind, like truth and justice. Of course, none of this would be possible if it wasn’t for the voters.   The victims here are the children, mainly, who have to go to classes based on this garbage, but also the teachers who have to teach it. I’ve been one and there are hundreds of good people who love and want to educate these kids, truly educate them, and they hate Walters more than anyone. They are doing their best while making some of the worst pay in the nation under the worst state superintendent in the nation.

"Having grown up in Oklahoma, it’s a wild experience reading these comments (I once got asked growing up if we all lived in teepees and rode horses to school 🤦‍♂️.) My siblings and I all grew up in public schools. I won’t list the credentials, results, universities, but we got a great education…..and at the same time, none of us live there anymore. We all chose to leave.   What’s happening there with Ryan Walter’s is tragic. Telling kids we don’t trust them with challenging stories about our past isn’t honest. We are fallible. Our human story if full of bigotry, violence, and also beauty, innovation, and miraculous leaps forward.   I feel we’re most well rounded when we accept all parts of our past and choose to learn from it. This centralized censorship of history (that didn’t just begin with the MAGA leadership) has been going on for such a long time. At the rate it’s escalating, I feel we’re moving further into a “post truth” society. A society where objective truth feels out of reach.

"> I disagree, Establishment Democrats have been terrified of wielding power for decades and now stand for absolutely nothing except “the status quo” which has already evaporated in only 3 months of Trump.  What you call the status quo most other just call the law. Yes, what Trump is doing violates all of that, he's a criminal. He helped put other criminals into power and other criminals were elected into position because they had an (R) at the end of their name.  What you want is for the Democrats to be criminals too, by and large, people vote for the Democrats because they aren't.  This is on everyone that let criminals get into power, and who have worked against those trying to keep rule of law around. Right now, that's kind of what you're doing.  >Any of these judges trying to stonewall the process should have immediately been disbarred and charged as accessories. However establishment dems are terrified of anything but being victims so they give up immediately after any amount of resistance. To be fair I also feel the same way about the ABA which now seems like a complete joke of an organization after letting federalist society stooges be activist judges for Trump.  Again, there is no legal process to do that. Democrats and the ABA would have to violate the law to do so. Which would have made them criminals.  The problem is our system is collapsing because people stopped caring about it. No offense, your conversation is proof of that. The bulk of what's happening right now, is happening because people are acting lawlessly and outside of procedure. You want it to stop, the answer is to bring Rule of Law back. But no one wants to do that because it takes time and is hard, and you've all been convinced everything needs to be torn down. Great, that's what the republicans are doing.  >Seems like Balkanization is inevitable because archaic proceduralism completely stonewalls any form of common sense, one of the things George Washington warned of when expressing the dangers of political parties.  What are you even talking about? Proceduralis IS government. At a fundamental level it is our country. The republicans are already getting rid of it, is this what you want? Because this is what it looks like. What you claim to want from this rant is exactly what the GOP and Trump are doing. Why are you not happy if they're doing what you want them to do?
