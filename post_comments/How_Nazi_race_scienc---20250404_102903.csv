"The Republicans are killing off democracy and turning America into a fascist, dystopian, idiocracy and Trump suporters don't even have a clue and are so out of touch with reality.  Those who chose to vote for that fascist poor excuse for a human being and his crazy clown show deserve all the bulls\*\*t that they get.",Apprehensive_Idea758,2025-04-04T10:56:13,33
"Holy shit, I just read that whole article and I am spooked. I have heard all those names and generally know what those people are about, but to see it all connected in this way and to hear their actual statements about democracy and race is beyond chilling.  Bunch of fucking monsters. This group of humanities-averse, sociopathic, egomaniacal, and downright delusional tech bros should not be in charge of *anything*, much less the government of the United States.",kbrick1,2025-04-04T10:57:31,20
"I don't blame the average person for simply not believing the content of this article because it's so far away from what we've been taught American society is and aspires to be, and yet, the concepts are laid bare; the players are named. This article explains how what we're seeing happen under the Trump Cabal is a plan created by, and for, white supremacist, autocratic fascists. It goes without saying these people are dangerous, and those who have some modicum of power and influence are making a huge mistake in capitulating to this administration in any way because, ultimately, no one will be safe from these people unless you're one of them. Simply consider how much influence white nationalists like Laura Loomer and Steven Miller have on Trump's decision making. Loomer has gotten at least five people dismissed from the administration THIS WEEK, and she holds no official role in this government.               It tough as it may be for some to digest, this article is a must read.",appmanga,2025-04-04T12:18:26,13
"Again, we are the lucky ones here. We can see the writing on the wall and plan. Maybe they won't be rhe best plans, maybe they will take years to execute, but we will be ready. A lot of people who voted for him won't be",Rosebunse,2025-04-04T13:29:04,5
"The news media and government has been co-opted by Russian fascist foreign agents, we are facing a potential national security crisis",amievenrelevant,2025-04-04T13:11:58,4
"Okay dude, whatever.  The problem with techno feudalism, and the Silicon Valley tech bro vision of the future, is that it requires as an absolute a populace to willingly take part.  Because of this, we are like 30 or 40 years out from it as the world needs to be generations deep into the majority of people on the planet not knowing a time without being on social media all day. Also, you won't know that it happened until one day when you get out of your lane and realize that freedom no longer exists.  Get the fuck off social media and it will stop near dead in its tracks. Stop binging show after show or spending hours, if not entire days, playing video games and they will lose. Get out of the house, and gasp, make a fucking effort to shop or cook and stop Door dashing or Amazoning everything, and they will lose.  But, if not, the joke is that their vision still requires physical buildings and infrastructure.  Also, I highly doubt that Trump meets Yarvin's definition of a benevolent dictator. And funny, these Silicon Valley tech dudes never see themselves as one of the people who need to get over the fear of dictatorship.  I mean, because they see themselves as the benevolent dictators.  Oh, and Yarvin's view kinda requires the entire world to get on board.  At least Theil recognizes the absurdity of it all and instead advocates for floating autonomous cities, or building the so called 'freedom cities' on public lands or whatever.  On the other hand, these are neurodivergent people we are talking about who generally agree that people in general are too stupid to exist and that authoritarianism is thus required.  There is an entire side to humanity that they simply cannot see or understand, and that is their downfall.  It is why Musk keeps fucking up and pissing people off and legit does not understand why people hate him.  Ramp this up to a legit dictatorship and Musk will be standing at the gallows not able to comprehend why he is about to be hung by the mob.",crucial_geek,2025-04-04T13:32:52,4
"How to neutralize Yarvin and folks like Steve Miller who insert his hate into our gov. First and foremost, stop your kids, especially young men from getting into him via the internet.",bakeacake45,2025-04-05T14:22:15,1
"Maybe.  The thing is that the GOP authoritarian regime and the MAGA regime are two, separate, visions.",crucial_geek,2025-04-04T13:37:31,4
