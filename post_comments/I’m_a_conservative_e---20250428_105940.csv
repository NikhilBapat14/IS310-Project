"Sigh, tl;dr since other commenters can't resist putting their own reasons out there.  1. Tariffs can‚Äôt both create permanent domestic jobs and be a temporary negotiating tool.  2. Tariffs can‚Äôt both protect domestic industries and generate trillions of dollars in revenue.  3. You can‚Äôt both eliminate the federal budget deficit and protect Social Security, Medicaid and other popular programs.  4. You can‚Äôt eliminate the federal budget deficit and also cut taxes.  5. DOGE‚Äôs actions are likely to increase the federal budget deficit, not lower it.  6. The national debt can‚Äôt matter one day and not the next.  Remember, these are coming from a conservative economist's POV.  Oddly enough, I agree with his last two points; it wouldn't surprise me if DOGE never found the huge amounts of federal government waste and bloat that they've been claiming was there, and their activities might even end up costing more than the amount that they do find; and Republicans are always such government deficit/debt hawks during Democratic-led administrations, but you only hear crickets during Republican-led administrations, so they need to take this economist's advice and either shut up about it entirely, or enforce paying down the deficit/debt during Republican administrations (including this one!), too.",takingastep,2025-04-28T11:52:17,26

"One of the reasons I'm somewhat suspicious of economics as a discipline is the idea that there *is* conservative or liberal economics. A scientist can certainly be a conservative, liberal, or whatever else they like politically, but you don't hear them characterize their discipline in those terms: e.g. you never see ""conservative physicist"" or ""liberal chemist"" in a news story and it be shorthand for how they view and approach science.",Cdub7791,2025-04-28T11:10:35,4

Donald Trump is a con man who switched party for his own ambition.  Republican party is gone. MAGA is the new Republican PARTY.,reddittorbrigade,2025-04-28T13:10:02,1
I feel like identifying as a conservative economist is a morally bankrupt position. The only 2 qualifiers are that you understand the newer economic systems of oppression and support them.,MustardCoveredDogDik,2025-04-28T17:21:33,1

"I feel that the comparison to hard sciences is invalid. (Saying this as an Econ grad) One aspect of Economics is its attempt to explain and predict/model human behavior in a world with finite resources, it is a soft/social science such as anthro, psych, or sociology. With that being said, political bias is going to have a greater impact in these disciplines. That doesn‚Äôt mean that the existence of these biases in the field doesn‚Äôt lessen the disciplines importance. That same bias is definitely present in hard sciences too (i.e. data being skewed based on which entity is funding the research) but it‚Äôs not talked about as much due to the overall perception the hard science disciplines hold",Thruwaymuzak,2025-04-28T11:45:25,6
Economics is little more than philosophy with some curve fitting equations for historical data to give it the appearance of a science. Their core assumption that markets are driven by rational actors is fundamentally flawed.,Unshkblefaith,2025-04-28T11:43:40,1
"Tariffs can be a reasonable tool, but they're something best used as a scalpel rather than used broadly let alone unilaterally. And as the article notes, so many of the promises are actively counter to each other - he's claiming that we can have both rather than having to choose, but without any reason to believe he's somehow able to do that.",The_Lost_Jedi,2025-04-28T12:10:01,1
