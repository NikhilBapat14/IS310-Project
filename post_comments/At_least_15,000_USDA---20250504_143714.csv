She will not compromise the critical work of the Department,” the spokesperson said.  But then:  >The resignations come after USDA announced a $1 billion cut to local food programs sponsored by the department amid calls for White House officials to also help lower the cost of eggs.  And:  [Egg companies are getting government bailouts while price-gouging consumers](https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/5275227-egg-price-inflation-cal-maine/)  >Gouging consumers is bad enough. But it gets worse: Cal-Maine and other ag companies were breaking the bank at the same time they were also quietly getting millions in taxpayer-funded relief payments from the federal government.",brain_overclocked,2025-05-04T14:42:04,26

I get why.  Who wants to be the one to report on a food or drug recall and risk being called “woke” and fired anyways because such news makes Trump look bad?,Popculturemofo,2025-05-04T15:54:31,7
