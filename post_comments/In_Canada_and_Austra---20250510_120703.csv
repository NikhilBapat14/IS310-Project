"Opinion from the article:  “Many days here, I find myself wondering why on earth more folks in this country don’t see the destruction emanating from Washington and rise up. Being in Australia, and seeing what happened in Canada, reminded me that millions of people do in fact rightly view what is happening here as utterly repellent. Trump’s dismal approval ratings hint that voters here, too, may be starting to awaken. The question is whether enough of them get to the ballot box when the time comes — and whether the country survives until then.”",Jaded-Bookkeeper-807,2025-05-10T12:11:47,1
