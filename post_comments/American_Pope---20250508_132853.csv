Smart play for the Vatican to go with an American Pope to avoid tariffs.,daringescape,2025-05-08T17:42:01,989
"Habemus Papam!  As an American Catholic, I genuinely love this.  Just my two cents; I’m honestly exhausted by people who only view the Pope through a political lens. The papacy isn’t a partisan office. The Pope isn’t some figurehead to be cheered or attacked based on party lines. He’s the Vicar of Christ, not a political operative. Reducing him to a cheap politician misses the entire point of his role and calling.",jshauns,2025-05-08T20:58:37,685

"As a Catholic, the only thing I hope is that he leads the Church effectively and that he leads the Church as an agent of Christ's message.  What I don't like is antitheists/atheists who all of a sudden care so much about who becomes Pope and treat it like a political game. On any other day of the week, the Pope is another regular Joe to them, but if he passes away and a new one is elected, all of a sudden they think that they become the authority on who was and wasn't a good Pope.",Artistic-Pool-4084,2025-05-08T23:17:34,74

Good Luck with your New Pope.,ComputerRedneck,2025-05-08T15:53:54,10
The papacy has always had political influence. Caring for the poor is at odds with government decisions sometimes. That’s just how the world is. Reality often gets in the way of perfection.,WillGibsFan,2025-05-09T04:32:00,3
"Curious to see his profile, he seems generally a bit more centrist then pope francis but obv still a pope. The name choice is interesting for both old and recent Leone, one stopped Attila and the other attempted to theologically confront communism if memory serves me well.",Outside_Ad_3888,2025-05-10T10:31:07,1

"They say he's more conservative on the gospel, if that's true, it'll be a good thing I think. That said, time will tell. I liked the energy Pope Francis brought to young people, just disliked his open politics and more liberal view of the gospel. He did a lot of good outwardly and for the reputation of the church to general public.  It is exciting to be in a new era though. The only thing I didn't like is he didn't speak in English during the inauguration. Would have been a neat thing to see with him being the first American Pope.",Markinoutman,2025-05-08T14:49:29,135

"Assuming I have the right X account, he reposted a tweet recently which was anti-Trump in regard to immigration policy.  I am Catholic, I generally liked Pope Francis (and likely this new Pope) but disagree with them on their immigration statements.  Catholic Doctrine is essentially this:  Nations have a moral duty to regulate immigration for the sake of order and security, but they must also treat migrants justly and humanely, especially those fleeing real danger.  To the new Pope I’d say: We are one of the most charitable nations in the world, but the President has a duty to enforce laws. We have treated removal humanely and illegal immigrants not following our laws does far more harm than good.  I’d then point him to Vatican City’s immigration policy for Exhibit A.",RotoDog,2025-05-08T14:38:38,53
