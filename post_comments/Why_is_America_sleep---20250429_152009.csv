"Honestly the only thing that might shake the median voter out of their stupor is losing their job while the cost of their trinkets and baubles from Amazon/Temu/Walmart goes through the roof.

"We're not. Huge protests and fiery town hall meetings aren't covered much by the news. What is needed is noncompliance to Donnie's Executive Orders. Media is largely owned by billionares and rarely report any discontent or opposition. House and Senate and  US Supreme Court are under Republican control. I believe revolution was structured into our Constitution but waiting a couple years to transition is frustrating. Some neighbors are offering safe places in their homes, 19 states are suing the Admin over EOs. There is action being done. The scary thing now is Donnie giving more authority to police and our military to act against citizens inside our own borders. He kinda circumvented the Insurrection Act.

"The mass media is owned by rich oligarchs. MAGA podcasts flood social media. This creates the echo chamber, where the only news people get reinforces the beliefs that have been hammered into them by generations of false pride, patriotism, and a general lack of curiousity and interest in anything outside their borders.   Over the years, niceties eroded and it was ok to reveal that you dislike minorities or marginalized groups, and immigrants.   The rich hoovered up the money that families used to have. This kept people down. They also told the middle class the problem was the poor and the immigrants and criminals who were eating up their tax dollars. Hatred became acceptable.   Covid was the perfect stressor that poured gas on the fire. ‚ÄúKaren's‚Äù emerged. It is now ok to yell or assault people for doing nothing wrong.   From this point onward, it was easy for MAGA to light the fuse and keep hate and distrust alive.   They relied on the ineffectiveness of the democrats and gained so much ground, they were able to gain control of every institution the US held up as what makes America great.   Failure to prosecute traitors, rapists, frauds and allowing them to take office was the last bit scoop of USA dignity being scraped off.   Now, they run the entire federal government. They are eliminating future threats. People won‚Äôt fight if we indoctrinate them and dumb down their education. The legal system was corrupted all the way up to SCOTUS.   Citizens are being deported without due process.   Medicaid and social safety nets and science, and research, are all being taken apart.   The opportunity to fix this passed a long time ago. Trump should have been put in jail years ago. Same with many of these other weasels that are the brains behind Planned Parenthood 2025.   They told you what they were going to do. You did not listen. Instead, they were voted in.   I don‚Äôt know what will happen next, but at some point in the next year, millions of Americans are going to finally realize what is happening.

Where are the concerted voices of college presidents as their colleagues are being hung out to dry?

I honestly don't know how a governor could possibly have missed them or even not been told of them, but evidently he somehow missed the memo. There are massive protests nationwide on a weekly basis, smaller but notable protests from relevant quarters like the ones he names, multiple articles of impeachment already working their way through the system, and legal showdowns in the courts stacked up so high that frankly I don't see how anyone could miss them.

"Trump visited my hometown yesterday, and there were no protests. My democratic governor went on stage with him to promote jobs at the air force base. Where is the outcry?

There‚Äôs a problem in places like Michigan, we value politicians who ‚Äúbring jobs back‚Äù. Yet, unemployment has increased dramatically here since he took office. Magna might be closing their doors. GM is moving their headquarters and possible operations to New York, and we‚Äôre hearing Ford might open more production in Canada instead of focusing on the US.

"This argument is so common but makes zero sense. If you go back a few decades, educational outcomes were worse than they are today, so despite republican attempts to destroy public education, we continue to make progress for the most part. The argument assumes that our education system was effective a few decades ago, but it was even more broken and ineffective than it is today. This is not a defense of republicans or of the education system. I hate both. But the logic of ""we are in this situation because republicans broke the education system"" just doesn't add up.

I was not the large portion of people who couldn‚Äôt bother to go vote. I‚Äôm not the reason this man got voted in. Me and my family actively tried to assist the other side in getting elected. Maybe you don‚Äôt understand. What I know is my values no longer match American values.   Stay on your high horse.

"I did, and so did that majority of progressives and leftists. This wasn't a ""Bernie or Bust"" election cycle. 3rd parties did horribly. Apathetic non-voters are not the same as progressive leftists.",Conscious_Emu6907,2025-04-30T04:42:00,2

"Yeah I‚Äôve been to them. Every Saturday. But they are pathetic in comparison to Occupy Wallstreet, and the demographics aren‚Äôt right either (at least in my state). I at 43 should not be amongst the younger faces. There are not enough other millennials or Gen Z. It‚Äôs babyboomers afraid of being homeless not 30 year olds who don‚Äôt want to live in a fascist state. There was no million man march in DC for the end of democracy ya know? It‚Äôs not the media‚Äôs fault for not covering it. It‚Äôs ours for not showing up. 100 million people live within a 12hr drive of DC. If just 5 out of 100 could get off of their asses things would be different by next week. True fucking story.",Ticksdonthavelymph,2025-04-29T16:52:50,3

"Agreed. Still, saying Americans are welcoming autocracy with ""wide open arms"" is far off base.  Again, no ""teeth"" will be shown until people have nothing to lose.   That's how humans are wired. There may be a few lone actors or domestic cells that take action in the near future but the people as a whole still have things they don't want to risk to lose.",CrunchySockTaco,2025-04-29T16:45:42,7

"Same answer. If you don't want to become progressive seeing what conservatives are capable of, if seeing fascism doesn't make you anti-fascist, it's because you're too far gone. If that means the US is beyond recovery, so be it.",Revlar,2025-04-29T20:47:26,3

We got too fucked by the boomers trying to own a home etc etc I‚Äôm not going to list everything our generation was shit on for, but I‚Äôm letting you know a lot of us live paycheck to paycheck. So I‚Äôm protesting from my chair because I don‚Äôt have time in my day to protest our shit government and its shit policies.

"I never said you do. The cowards who won‚Äôt show up said that as an excuse for their own lack of participation.

Having Saturday off isn‚Äôt having money to waste‚Ä¶ it;s like talking to a Republican. You‚Äôre right. Don‚Äôt protest see what happens. The French protest en masse about retirement being raised to 62 and Americans can‚Äôt get off the couch on Saturday to go downtown to voice their opinions on impending fucking martial law‚Ä¶ something isn‚Äôt clicking guy.
