This is exactly why Trump doesn’t want to due process for people he wishes to deport. He doesn’t want any paper trail of who they are what happened to them.  Where’s the churches the mega churches? Why are they not speaking out? Are these not God’s children? Or do they not feed the appropriate collection basket?,thomport,2025-04-22T13:08:14,31

"Every US citizen should be alarmed by these recent revelations about the current administration’s abusive deportation processes. No matter how strongly you feel against illegal immigration. Or whether or not you even want to accept any people who don’t look or believe like you do. Evidence shows that this man followed the rules and laws in place when he entered and lawfully supported himself and his child while living here. Those who insist on immigrants “doing it the right way” need to support government that follows through ethically and legally. To do otherwise weakens those laws and procedures that protect each individual.                         A delivery driver made a wrong turn onto a bridge and sent his friend a text that didn’t indicate he had any fear of being able to turn around and get back to work. I hope you’re concerned and want a more accountable system. Even if you lack compassion for those individuals adversely affected by the present system. You, or a loved one could next.",nativerestorations1,2025-04-22T16:34:17,5
"20 years ago, America had better human rights than most countries. The only human rights atrocities happened to people who did not live in America, in war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Now the human rights situation is slightly worse than in China. At least in the PRC, you have the safety of being in the world's second largest haystack. Even if you say something anti-government, chances are, there is so much background noise that the government will never notice that you said anything in the first place.  But America has a much smaller population. This is why political dissidents face more danger in Russia and America. Smaller haystacks.",PenImpossible874,2025-04-22T12:32:40,14
This should be enough to halt any and all of these immigration roundups - it’s insane that this isn’t the MOST IMPORTANT THING WE ARE HANDLING,Robot_Alchemist,2025-04-22T17:57:05,3

"Let's not forget Trump disappeared over 4600 immigrant children during his first administration.  Thankfully the Biden administration was able to find and reunite about 3240 of them, but [1360 still remained unaccounted for after his term ended](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/12/16/us-lasting-harm-family-separation-border).

"How many of those moments have we had to this point? The “this would end any other presidency” incident list must be literally, not hyperbole, over 1,000 long?",OldPiano6706,2025-04-22T16:12:30,31

"China has been committing genocide against the Uyghur people for many years, so this take is terrible. That the US is being spoken in the same breath though, from Trump’s attack on democracy and civil liberties and the bipartisan support for Israel’s genocide, though is very concerning.",JL4575,2025-04-22T13:52:38,7

"I wouldn't call it that. It's more like racial profiling, biased policing, and mass incarceration, which is also what the US does.  They're mostly profiling and incarcerating Uighur men who are 16-30, which is also what racist police officers do in the US.",PenImpossible874,2025-04-22T13:54:51,10
To clarify - that is genocide. Genocide doesn’t only become genocide once you successfully eradicate a population. It starts with profiling and criminalizing them.   And its all shit that the US has and is currently doing,Igoko,2025-04-22T14:02:04,6
"Oh, dear, a shill. It’s a genocide and is widely recognized as such. Get out of here with that trash. If there’s a parallel with the US, it’s our extermination, forcible resettlement, and cultural genocide of Native American peoples.",JL4575,2025-04-22T13:59:16,3
It's racism but not genocide. The United States is not currently gencoding Latino and African American men.,PenImpossible874,2025-04-22T14:03:10,-4
"If they wanted to do that to Uighurs they would have inflicted the 1 child policy on them. On the contrary, they exempted Uighurs from the 1 child policy.",PenImpossible874,2025-04-22T14:04:05,-2
"Ok, so if the systemic incarceration of a population isn’t genocide, then what is? Is it only genocide when you start up the gas chambers? Is it only genocide when you succeed in the extermination? It’s like arguing that Hitler moving the Jewish people to ghettos wasn’t part of the Holocaust.   Systemic racism is a direct line to genocide. When we see institutionalized racism and oppression, we shouldn’t say “well, at least it’s not genocide yet!” and wait for them to start the gas chambers. We should stop them BEFORE it’s too late to prevent the millions of deaths.",Igoko,2025-04-22T14:07:33,6
"They have forcefully sterilized some Uyghur women. Stop defending China and their treatment of these people, it's pretty gross.",RobonianBattlebot,2025-04-22T17:05:58,3
"If he had put them in internment camps but had not killed them, I would consider that equal to Japanese American internment in the US.",PenImpossible874,2025-04-22T14:08:29,-4
They did it actually to equalize the law during the one child policy. What happened was that they were sterilizing other women for having had 3 kids. But did not originally apply that law to Uighurs until years later.,PenImpossible874,2025-04-22T17:09:30,-1
