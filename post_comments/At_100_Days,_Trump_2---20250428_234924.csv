Unfortunately that means we're in trouble while he's richer.,SaltyLonghorn,2025-04-28T23:57:06,32
He's. Still. The. Fucking. President.  So tired of this. It would have been SO fucking easy to NOT elect him and us having to rehash this shit day after fucking day... But no. 90 million sat this one out because of their feelings. Trump is NOT in trouble. He's in office now. Go fuck yourself WSJ.,williamgman,2025-04-29T00:30:37,58
"Typical WSJ editorial praising Trump for his ""successes"" that aren't before softballing his failures.",OldBat001,2025-04-29T00:21:20,13
"Trump is not in trouble, he couldn't give a shit about the issues faced by the average American.      Trump led a coup, was convicted of a shitliad of felonies, and gets to be a billionaire president probably for the rest of his life.     America is in trouble, anyone who lives paycheck to paycheck is in trouble, anyone that gets seriously ill over the next few years will be fucked, and anyone who isn't a white cis male will be lucky to still have any human rights by the end of the year.     Trump though, he's fine.",Ginger_Daisies,2025-04-29T00:41:26,10

"TL;DR:  In a surprising turnabout the WSJ editors admit that they are nothing more than a set of sycophant right-wing ass-kissers in the desperate hope that the American public will find them relevant again and start reading their bullshit rag.     Unfortunately, as they have learned, the majority of Trump supporters have IQs under 80 and hence do not spend a lot of time reading.     Enjoy your ever-increasing irrelevancy, WSJ!",Mutex70,2025-04-29T00:31:37,6
"Non paywalled gift link. Excerpt:  > Presidential second terms are rarely successful, and on the evidence of his first 100 days Donald Trump’s won’t be different. The President needs a major reset if he wants to rescue his final years from the economic and foreign-policy shocks he has unleashed.  > [...]  > That’s especially true on tariffs, which could sink his Presidency. Mr. Trump was elected to control inflation and raise real incomes, but tariffs do the opposite. They guarantee at least a one-time increase in prices on imported goods that will flow through the economy. They portend shortages for consumers, and for businesses that source goods and components from abroad.   > The tariffs are the largest economic policy shock since Richard Nixon blew up Bretton Woods in 1971, which unleashed inflation that Nixon tried to stop with wage and price controls and a tariff. The economic consequences arguably doomed Nixon’s second term, perhaps as much as Watergate.  > It’s a mistake to think the tariff damage is only domestic. The willy-nilly assault on friends and foes has shaken global confidence in U.S. reliability. Ken Griffin, the investor and major donor to Mr. Trump, summed it up last week as a self-inflicted blow to the American brand. The U.S. is needlessly ceding global economic leadership.",nosotros_road_sodium,2025-04-28T23:50:11,7

"FTA: “There’s no denying his energy or ambition. Mr. Trump is pressing ahead on multiple fronts, and he has had some success. His expansion of U.S. energy production is proceeding well and is much needed after the Biden war on fossil fuels. He has ended the border crisis in short order.   He is also rolling back federal assaults on mainstream American values—such as by policing racial favoritism.

"Yep, all good, i was responding to the quote as it hadn't been elaborated on more. Kind of a tag team there. Sorry if it seemed like i was responding to you. The wsj op-ed section is much farther right than their news section, which is a little fairer, but still a little right leaning. Yes, occasionally you might get what would appear those op-eds that stand up somewhat to 45, but those are few and far between. So once again, sorry if you thought i was going after you.",I-WishIKnew,2025-04-29T10:47:44,1
