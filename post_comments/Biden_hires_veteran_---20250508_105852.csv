Is he going to stop making public appearances? Because no amount of gaslighting can override his blunders.,rdenghel,2025-05-08T11:03:46,20
"The time to consider a tarnished reputation is before you do anything to tarnish it. Like allowing 10 million+ illegal aliens into the country, forcing people to get vaccinated or lose their job, enriching your family by selling out the country, pardoning scumbags (including your son and other family members, Fauci, J6 committee members), lawfare against your political opponents, stumbling and mumbling your way through an illegitimate presidency.  Jimmy Carter was just a horrible president. Biden was also a horrible president but the difference is, he was extremely corrupt and mean-spirited as well. There is no amount of PR that can change that.",cossbobo,2025-05-08T12:21:41,16
"If Biden wants to fix his tarnished reputation, he should go with the saying that, “absence makes the heart grow fonder”, or, “time heals all wounds”.  In other words, stay in your basement and eat you ice cream; people will forget you soon enough.",mdws1977,2025-05-08T11:29:23,13
"It's far too late for that, Joe.  Just find a nice nursing home, already.",BoredAtWork1976,2025-05-08T12:56:54,8
"There is nothing he can do to save his reputation. He was the worst president in modern history set on destroying the country and the lives of everyday Americans. No amount of gaslighting can change this. Anybody who thinks he's great is so far to the left they'll think a pile of shit with a (D) next to it is also great. And honestly, a pile of shit might actually be better than him.",RandolphE6,2025-05-08T15:59:49,6
What a vain approach. The guy truly only cares about himself.,MapleMonstera,2025-05-09T09:29:15,1
Polishing a turd doesn't chant the fact that it's a turd.,letmeinfornow,2025-05-10T09:33:30,1
"""Forget"" being the key term here. That's the best he can hope for, because no one is going to remember this corrupt cretins tenure kindly.",WPWeasel,2025-05-08T12:00:56,10
