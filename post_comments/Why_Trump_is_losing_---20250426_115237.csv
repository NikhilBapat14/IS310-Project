"Highlighted section from the article:  >By most accounts, China feels little need to come to the table. Chinese leaders reportedly believe that they can wait Trump out. They’re not enticed by his floated offers of partial tariff relief, but instead favor a total pause on the tariffs, as a condition for commencing negotiations over the two nations’ trade disputes. > >China’s intransigence may take some US observers (particularly those in the White House) by surprise. The Chinese economy has been suffering from deflation, due to a collapse in its property sector. Manufacturing has been one of the nation’s few economic bright spots. Now, as many as 20 million Chinese workers are at risk of losing their jobs because of a collapse in exports to the US, according to an estimate from Goldman Sachs. > >Nevertheless, the Chinese government believes that it has the upper hand in this trade fight. And they’re probably right. That could have dire implications for America’s economy, if Trump cannot reconcile himself to a near total capitulation.   And three key points:  1. China’s stuff is more precious than America’s money 2. America’s allies have little interest in joining our trade war 3. This trade war is less politically damaging for the CCP than the GOP  How trade wars are started, won, lost, or settled is more than just a simple spreadsheet calculation, but rather are dependent on a host of other issues. By focusing just on simple numbers above all other factors before starting a global trade war and alienating former stalwart allies, this administration has painted itself into a corner.",Hrmbee,2025-04-26T11:57:38,31

"It makes sense. Trump has been making major decisions with little to no planning or strategy. We've seen that with his plan to move all the immigrants to Cuba, the TikTok ban (which was his idea), and these tariffs. He's making America worse in the long term and will amass more debt, which the next administration after him will inherit and have to fix. What a mess. The way we do politics is outdated. As valuable as the Constitution is, having a divided two-party system is no longer effective unless you find filibustering, government shutdowns, and rash decision-making beneficial. There is no long-term planning unless the same party wins because the opposing party will undo everything. There's no collaboration or communication, and as a result, no progress.  For the longest time, the democrats and the republicans have been the same party. Both are pushing neoliberalism and conservatism to a degree. The only difference is the packaging and the people they market to. However, thanks to Trump, the tone has changed drastically. In his appeal to populism, he has effectively destroyed the landscape of American politics by making it more divisive. We can no longer see eye to eye, and by his message of Making America Great, he has effectively implied that the other party is making America worse, and with that emotional appeal, he has created echo chambers, extremist groups, and dangerous people on both sides of the aisle.  We're in a new century, and to be more effective and competitive, we need strategic planning and operations. We need long-term development and well-thought-out thinking, and more importantly, we need collaboration. This is how the top 500 businesses stay at that level, and how developing countries like Singapore and China continuously achieve all of their plans and surpass benchmarks. Our country, on the other hand, is ruled by businesses because that is the only class of people both parties have been supporting under neoliberalism for the past couple of decades. Biden, even though he has helped cause this, was right about the oligarchy, which Trump has always been a part of. We need a major change to how we do politics in this country if we ever want to get out of this mess and catch up with our competitors.",JoineDaGuy,2025-04-26T12:43:01,1

"How do we break the reliance on China? Im not convinced that the entire globe essentially relying on one country for a lot of their manufacturing is a good thing..

"Trump is advised by a bunch of bozos who are 20 years behind the times and think China's only asset in trade is cheap labor. They're a middle income country so they don't even have labor that cheap anymore.  Their actual advantages are:  1. Being a supply chain superpower. A supply chain is not just a factory and the parts that come into it. Modern manufacturing supply chains are complicated and geopolitically entwined. Yet no one seems to understand this.  2. Skilled and giant workforce. ""Unskilled"" labor (I some people have a problem with that term but it's a real term used in economics) is defined as stuff you can train on the job, like making food. Skilled labor is defined as things that you need to do an apprenticeship or go to trade school or college for before you can make any money for your employers. You can't move skilled labor in a short time period to another country, it just doesn't work.   3. Affordability: While manufacturing labor in the US costs $15 an hour MINIMUM, in China it's still like $5-6 an hour.",Rich_Housing971,2025-04-26T12:33:44,24

">  By focusing just on simple numbers above all other factors before starting a global trade war and alienating former stalwart allies, this administration has painted itself into a corner.  Before tariffs you make stuff to sell. Trump missed a step. A really big first step. That was the whole point of Democrats working around Republican sabotage so that USA could start building factories to make the stuff to be sold so people could buy made in America.   Now, people just don't buy stuff. USA based companies can't afford to make stuff and people in USA can't afford to buy stuff. This becomes a problem when people need to pay for rent and pay for food.

Beijing wants to see a number of steps from Washington before it will agree to trade negotiations, including showing more respect and naming a point person for the dialogue, Bloomberg News previously reported. >  > Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesman He Yadong earlier Thursday at a regular briefing in Beijing dismissed speculation that progress has been made in bilateral communications, saying “***any reports on development in talks are groundless***,” and urging the US to “show sincerity” if it wants to make a deal. “The US should respond to rational voices in the international community and within its own borders and thoroughly remove all unilateral tariffs imposed on China, if it really wants to solve the problem,” he said. >  > Pressed on which administration officials were involved in discussions, the US president said, “it doesn’t matter who ‘they’ is. We may reveal it later, but they had meetings this morning, and we’ve been meeting with China.”   >  > The US leader said Wednesday that “everything’s active” when asked if he was engaging with China and that Beijing was “going to do fine” once talks had settled. >  > Trump shifted his tone yet again on Thursday, criticizing Beijing for refusing to take deliveries of Boeing Co. jets and for its role in the trade of illegal fentanyl. The US imposed 20% tariffs on Chinese imports tied to fentanyl before slapping them with an additional 125% duty.  >  > The remarks from China’s commerce and defense ministries came hours after Pan Gongsheng, governor of the People’s Bank of China, ***warned of the threat ongoing frictions posed to trust in the global economic system***, during Chinese officials’ first trip to the US since Trump unleashed his biggest tariffs yet. >  > “***All parties should strengthen cooperation and make efforts to prevent the global economy from sliding into a track of ‘high friction, low trust***,’” Pan said at a Group of 20 meeting in Washington on Wednesday, according to a social media post by state broadcaster China Central Television.

"The reason China hasn't crashed the dollar is because that would be bad for China.  China does not want a desperate destabilized USA.

Trump Floats the Idea of Executing Joint Chiefs Chairman Milley   https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/09/trump-milley-execution-incitement-violence/675435/   >Late Friday night, the former president of the United States—and a leading candidate to be the next president—insinuated that America’s top general deserves to be put to death.  >That extraordinary sentence would be unthinkable in any other rich democracy.

Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, assured his Chinese counterpart, Gen.

We are not going to attack or conduct any kinetic operations against you. General Li, you and I have known each other for now five years. If we’re going to attack, I’m going to call you ahead of time.
