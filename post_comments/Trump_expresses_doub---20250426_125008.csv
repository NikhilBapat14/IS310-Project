"How many ~~years~~ decades did it take Krasnov to figure out he's daddy's half-wit laughingstock?  Trump's highest approval ratings come in countries lead by fugitive War Criminals, whose boots he's licking.",XSinTrick6666,2025-04-26T12:57:26,4
"I think his cheese has slid off his cracker, not the brightest light in the house, 10 cents short of a dime, any less intelligent and we'd have to water him twice a week, not the sharpest tool in the shed, if brains were dynamite he wouldn't have enough to blow his nose, A few fries short of a Happy Meal, One sandwich short of a picnic and a few cards short of a full deck.",Thund3rbolt,2025-04-26T12:59:12,4

"So much for the intellectual abilities of our top military leader, Mr. Trump. I am not sure whether he is naÃ¯ve or whether he is not able to grasp complicated relationships and thus act in the long term. When it comes to persecuting people who have upset or disappointed him, he can display a remarkable, morbid stubbornness.",Spirited-Top3307,2025-04-26T15:17:37,2
