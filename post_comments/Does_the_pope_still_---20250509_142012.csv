"IMHO it's not so much that the Pope is political, but that the Republican party has rebuilt itself as the Christian party.   When the Pope takes Catholicism in a different direction than right-wing America, do they blame themselves for not being religious, or do they blame religion for not being what they want it to be?",hymie0,2025-05-10T19:08:22,1
