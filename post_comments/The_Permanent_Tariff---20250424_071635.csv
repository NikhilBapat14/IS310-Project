US retailers put their Christmas orders in this time of year.  With all of the uncertainty the orders are on pause.  There is a better than 50% chance that the shelves will be empty this Christmas in the US.  If that happens Trump will be remembered as the üçä grinch who stole Christmas.,TubeframeMR2,2025-04-24T07:28:31,13

They‚Äôll blame Biden and say he should‚Äôve negotiated a deal before he left office. Or that it‚Äôs Obama‚Äôs/Hillary‚Äôs/Kamala‚Äôs fault somehow.,jarellano89,2025-04-24T09:19:28,2

"Smolhands also said yesterday afternoon that he has had ""several calls with Canada"" and that ""negotiations with Canada"" were happening.    Carney's office put out the truth.  Exactly 1 call, that everyone knows well, on March 28th.  The ""break up"" call.  No other calls between his office and Canada.    Who's telling the truth?  One of the three is a known liar.",Postom,2025-04-24T07:54:21,9
Imagine you are not an American and you are watching Americans inflict this shit upon themselves.  At that point it is as funny as watching a dumbass blow his own testicles off with a shotgun while he's doing a kegstand,Deinosoar,2025-04-24T07:39:45,4
