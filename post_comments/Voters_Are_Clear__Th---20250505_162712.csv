"“Religion has actually convinced people that there's an invisible man living in the sky who watches everything you do, every minute of every day. And the invisible man has a special list of ten things he does not want you to do. And if you do any of these ten things, he has a special place, full of fire and smoke and burning and torture and anguish, where he will send you to live and suffer and burn and choke and scream and cry forever and ever 'til the end of time! But He loves you. He loves you, and He needs money! He always needs money! He's all-powerful, all-perfect, all-knowing, and all-wise, somehow just can't handle money!” -George Carlin",PatrolPunk,2025-05-05T21:38:36,33

Instead of pursuing reforms to break up “too big to fail” institutions or EVEN HOLDING A SINGLE EXECUTIVE ACCOUNTABLE, Obama’s policies allowed the same financial giants that caused the crash to consolidate even more power. They not only failed to address the root causes of the crisis but also laid the groundwork for the growing wealth inequality, housing instability, and corporate dominance that IS the U.S. economy today.

"> Stupidity is a more dangerous enemy of the good than malice. One may protest against evil; it can be exposed and, if need be, prevented by use of force. Evil always carries within itself the germ of its own subversion in that it leaves behind in human beings at least a sense of unease.  > Against stupidity we are defenseless.  > Neither protests nor the use of force accomplish anything here; reasons fall on deaf ears; facts that contradict one’s prejudgment simply need not be believed – in such moments the stupid person even becomes critical – and when facts are irrefutable they are just pushed aside as inconsequential, as incidental. In all this the stupid person, in contrast to the malicious one, is utterly self satisfied and, being easily irritated, becomes dangerous by going on the attack. For that reason, greater caution is called for when dealing with a stupid person than with a malicious one. Never again will we try to persuade the stupid person with reasons, for it is senseless and dangerous",FlufferTheGreat,2025-05-06T09:50:41,2

I have no clue. I really don’t. I’m just very angry right now. I just know I am done playing this game with the Dems.,NegotiationExtra8240,2025-05-06T09:04:46,1
"I get it. I’ve been angry too. 14 week old daughter in a time where she may have no rights by the time she’s an adult. Raising a kid in a time when our economy is going down the drain. Rampant racism and bigotry everywhere. Friends and family I’ve had to cut off because they’re toxic maga people. It sucks.   But I don’t want to see the good people to become evil and hateful like republicans.  The answer is education, truthfulness, and common sense change. How that happens in a time where ignorance and hatred is popular…idk",AlexADPT,2025-05-06T09:07:45,2
I raise my nephew and niece and I have no hope for their future at the moment. I’ve even started a fucking garden in case shit goes that far. I know what the answers are. I live in rural VA.
