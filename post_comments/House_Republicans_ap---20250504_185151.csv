"*Dismissing Democrats’ inquiries as “political hijinks and political stunts,” House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., gave The Hill a handwaving quote to justify the move, saying, “They showed us over the last four years, last eight years — they used lawfare, they used conspiracy theories, all these political weapons to just go after the president and make his life miserable.”*  Oh, does that little elf mean like what they did with Joe Biden and his son during his entire presidency??",LivingIndependence,2025-05-04T21:04:23,238

Hopefully the voters will be tired of this in 2 years.  I think people need to know every tariff that kills our economy is approved by the Republicans in Congress since they have the ability to stop them.,HippieJed,2025-05-05T06:15:58,15
"Are we surprised by this. Same song. Different verse. We are all crazy, conspiracy-driven psychopaths going after poor, defenseless, honest politicians. Funny how all of these “conspiracies” sound like us just literally repeating what these hard-working super citizens are saying yet ending it with a question mark. It is like a feeding frenzy. People foaming at the mouth to defend their own demise. Mind blowing!",crescentroze,2025-05-05T09:12:03,7
Repugnicants don't plan on giving up power. If they were they wouldn't remove the reigns like this and give a Democrat president this kind of power.,Hyperactiv3Sloth,2025-05-05T10:13:06,3
They’re stealing all of the US taxpayers money and then they’re all retiring. More than half of them are already planning their retirement. They pretty much quit working already.,mesoloco,2025-05-05T11:05:56,3
WHY WAS THIS ALLOWED AS A THING??? Where in the constitution does it say elected officials take an oath to go in and just do whatever dumb shit pops into their dumb heads. Is the US Congress not a serious place?,mabols,2025-05-05T12:44:21,1

Why? Why? I really don’t understand why the Republicans are fine with handing over the power to a narcissistic criminal. Are their jobs really worth selling their souls to the devil?? Surely they see the train wreck coming.,CartographerOk8036,2025-05-04T22:07:28,103

"These are Confederates playing with words.   > Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.    Jean-Paul Sartre",sack-o-matic,2025-05-05T11:11:51,3

"The last election was riddled with evidence of manipulation by the party of projection. We aren't getting anymore elections, they will never go our way again.  Get with the tones, they are actually fucking bragging about it on video and Elon talks about it so much around Kevlar that even a preschooler knows it",hazeyindahead,2025-05-05T10:28:09,10
"They hate America. It is that simple.   They have hated this country ever since the Civil Rights Act passed and black folks gained rights, everything forward from there for them has been a mistake that they are trying to correct; gay rights, women’s rights, worker rights, social programs etc etc etc, all of them abominable mistakes that have allowed their social, sexual, gender, racial *inferiors* to rise above their station resulting in a chaotic, disordered, libertine society where there is no defined and enforced hierarchy, where anyone can become anything.  Rip it all down; put the freaks, uppity women and PoC back in their place and make sure they never rise from it again. They do this for their sakes and the sakes of their mediocre, frat boy, rapist sons so that they can coast through life on the backs of their lessers.  If it hurts, all the better, a proper scourging to the society that has abandoned the great truth of their supremacy over all.  In short, they hate you, me and America and the more we hurt the more they smile.",PloddingAboot,2025-05-05T07:40:27,40
The Republican politicians are all going to use their insider trading to become rich and then run off to the Bahamas or something to live out the rest of their lives in luxury long before Trump turns on them.,immortalfrieza2,2025-05-04T22:16:13,68
"I would imagine it's like going all-in on a game of poker. They've made their bets, and they're all in for better or worse. They're relying on transferring power to the authoritarian because their end game is to permanently cement Republican rule via dismantling elections and the constitution.  In the party's mind I'll bet they're thinking: Trump is temporary, but if he secures permanent power NOW, the party will be in control even after he's gone and forever.",aws5923,2025-05-05T10:32:33,4
