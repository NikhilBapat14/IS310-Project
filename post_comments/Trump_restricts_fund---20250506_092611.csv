"But it was under Trump's last admin that they reversed Obama's moratorium.   https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/dual-use-research/feds-lift-gain-function-research-pause-offer-guidance      https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/who-we-are/nih-director/statements/nih-lifts-funding-pause-gain-function-research  Trump is constantly undoing Obama's work then having to deal with the consequences and just put it back to the way Obama had it. Remember when we had a nuclear deal with Iran and Trump and undid that? Now what are we doing? Oh yeah, trying to make a deal again. Quit wasting tax payer money.",therapistofcats,2025-05-06T09:45:56,21
FFS..old man with dementia second guesses scientists. These mutations are how we learn about pathologic mechanisms and the best way to design drugs or vaccines.,RabidGuineaPig007,2025-05-06T09:31:02,37
Weird that NPR makes zero mention that Trump's admin first term is the one that lifted the 2014 [restrictions in 2017](https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/who-we-are/nih-director/statements/nih-lifts-funding-pause-gain-function-research) after a year long review.,radicalelation,2025-05-06T09:47:32,6

Name a single drug or vaccine for a pathogen  developed using gain of function ,KazumaKuwabaraSensei,2025-05-07T17:49:13,1
"You're right, but gain of function research is the reason why millions of lives were lost due to the covid pandemic.  It's no longer a conspiracy when our government concluded the likeliest origin of covid 19 a leak from a lab that was conducting gain of function research",ron_marinara,2025-05-06T14:56:02,1
"Gain of function came out of chemical and biological weapons testing. Zero civilian applications have ever come out of this field of research, and has never helped with a medical use. Other than giving causing a worldwide pandemic in wuhan. So quite the use case.",Momsinfatuation,2025-05-06T13:10:27,1

It's even easier when about a minute later he has no memory of anybody talking to him at all. It was just this idea he had.,Valuable_Sea_4709,2025-05-06T10:34:01,5
"This may or may not but true, but it’s besides the point. Gain of function research is crazy risky.  This includes accidental lab leaks or an intentional leak by a deranged lab employee. Keep in mind that we developed the COVID vaccine in several week after we got our hands on it; the risk of gain of function science cannot account for the speed in which we can develop vaccines. Even a broken clock can be correct twice a day.",BigMuscles,2025-05-06T16:06:27,2
"Agreed, it is crazy risky  There's a pretty convincing book called Bitten that makes the case that Lyme disease was also an accidental lab leak.  It sounds crazy, but the evidence is convincing.  Here's the tldr:  In the '70s, we had a bioweapons lab on Plum Island that was conducting gain of research experiments. There are C.I.A. documents that confirm at this lab we were infecting ticks with air-bourne diseases to be used as a bioweapon against adversaries.  At this time, the closest major population to this lab was East Lyme Connecticut, which is where there was the first major breakout of Lyme disease - hence the reason why it is called Lyme Disease. William Burgdorfer was the main scientist at Plum Island who was conducting this research, and before his death he alluded to Lyme Disease being a lab leak.  I'm not saying it was deliberate, nor do I think Lyme Disease would make for an effective bioweapon, but all of those coincidences are really suspicious and we can't rule out an accidental lab leak",ron_marinara,2025-05-06T16:50:03,0
