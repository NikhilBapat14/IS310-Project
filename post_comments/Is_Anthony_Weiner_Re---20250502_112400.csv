"I believe in redemption, but if Weiner thinks a regular gig as the left-wing foil on WABC counts as “a smaller life,” he’s still got some learning to do. The man’s ego is still huge, and his self-awareness still microscopic.",erg99,2025-05-02T11:46:32,7

"I remember this 🤡  New York voters, some of the dumbest blue state voters in the country, will likely elect him.

"Almost 14 years after Anothony Weiner “accidentally posted the first lewd photo to his Twitter account, and six years after he walked out of a minimum-security prison, having served 18 months for transferring obscene material to a minor, Weiner is running for city council in New York,” Josh Tyrangiel writes. “Is his candidacy a test of America’s capacity to forgive? A provocation for Democrats to stop clutching their pearls while Trump gropes his way to authoritarianism?  “… Weiner is the cherry atop one of the most absurd primary seasons in New York City history. On June 24, Democrats will make a mayoral choice from candidates including the hugely unpopular now-you’re-indicted, now-you’re-not incumbent (Eric Adams) and a vengeful former governor who resigned after accusations of sexual harassment that he has denied (Andrew Cuomo). There’s also a socialist who wants to use subway stations to house even more homeless people than they currently do. Weiner’s top rival in the city-council race is a previously anonymous assemblyman who went viral when ‘Saturday Night Live’ spoofed his name—Harvey Epstein—which is somehow even more unfortunate than Weiner’s. We need to hurry up and vote before Rudy Giuliani gets any ideas.  “When I first contacted Weiner, I figured he might be subdued by having to play the penitent. There’s not much evidence of his campaign in the neighborhood, and his one-word email response to my interview request felt like a sigh: ‘Ok.’  “I should not have been concerned. Two weeks later, we met for breakfast. He’s still slim as a minnow, loud as a gong. ‘I’m a fucking Rorschach!’ Weiner told me exuberantly.  “‘My thing is so sui generis,’ he continued. ‘Everyone that I talk to about the race, they fundamentally know perfectly what approach I should take. Some people are like, ‘You should say, ‘Fuck it. Donald Trump got elected as a 34-time felon.’ Or lean into it, you know. Make a joke about it.’ And about an equal number of people say, ‘You got to spend the first four or five pieces of mail apologizing, explaining that you served your whatever it is, you’ve learned your lesson.’  “Spending time with Weiner is like living inside an episode of ‘The Bear.’ The profanity and fervor are relentless—and seemingly inextricable from the talent. Even with more than a decade of political rust on him, it only took a few minutes to be reminded that tact is often just the first casualty of his convictions.  “… If confrontation is the deepest form of love, Weiner is the Buddha. That’s the generous take. The less generous one is that he’s obsessive—he’s never met a boundary he respects or a consequence he fears. That his certainty and enthusiasm are tied up with a need to dominate. That he’s not merely tumescent; he needs you to see it.  “Self-knowledge can be overrated, but Weiner, deep into his fourth decade in public life, has never been particularly good at disguising or explaining any of this. ‘I’m not sure where the snake is eating its tail—did I have a need that was being fed by my career? Did I go into that career because I was dealing with these inner demons and whatever?’ He is the only subject where his conviction has consistently failed him. A Rorschach test even to himself.”  Read more: [https://theatln.tc/CBPCE06S](https://theatln.tc/CBPCE06S) ",theatlantic,2025-05-02T11:24:19,-1
