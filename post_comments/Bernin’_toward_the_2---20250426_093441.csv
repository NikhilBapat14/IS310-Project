I think Sen. Bernie Sanders best location is as Sen. Bernie Sanders or VP. Sen. Bernie Sanders to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s. I know a good deal of my country have trouble accepting a woman as President but she is from my limited view the best option for us that don't have millions in the bank.,Raregolddragon,2025-04-26T11:01:57,6
"I’m legitimately confused what path we need to take for 2028. I like AOC/Bernie and I think the support they’re getting is awesome, but I still have doubts that a far left dem ticket will be successful. I think we’ll have to see what happens with the midterms.",sportyspice303,2025-04-26T15:23:06,0
"We already saw how pandering to the moderate went last election. The GOP already has a trifecta, so there's not much more that Dems can lose by pushing more leftist platforms. I'd argue that Dems have been on the losing side after dropping the (still very popular at the time) New Deal platforms with Jimmy Carter.   The right will call us baby eating communists either way, so what is there to lose from pushing policies that both entice and *actually help* voters?",Massive_Town_8212,2025-04-26T15:36:51,6
