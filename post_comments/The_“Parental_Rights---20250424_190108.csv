"We all know SCOTUS is going to rule in favor of the bigots. The bigger question is what standard will they set? Will they allow parents to request alternative materials for anything (for example, a nonwhite character showing up in a children's book)? If so, then this will cause chaos as a practical matter to accommodate every parent on every request. Will they set an arbitrary standard saying LGBTQ bad? If so, then the SCOTUS has just set in stone that anti-LGBTQ beliefs will be given special deference by the government.",JesterOfEmptiness,2025-04-24T22:11:22,7

"I understand that not all Anti-LGBTQ sentiments are ginned up by fascists, but clearly organizations like the ironically named '[Moms For Liberty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moms_for_Liberty)' are funded by those supporting fascism.   While the leaders of 'Moms for Liberty' have stated that their organization is non-partisan and grounded in conservative values.  In fact all three founders 'Moms for Liberty' are registered Republicans, and the organization has ties to the Republican Party.  'Moms for Liberty' is also affiliated with the Proud Boys, a far right neo-fascist organization.  Pretty clearly this Anti-LGBTQ organization is being funded by fascists, and is serving the interests of fascists who wish to control our nation's educational system.  The efforts of 'Moms for Liberty' can not be fully appreciated without being aware of who is behind them and seeing how their efforts coincide with other similar efforts of fascists to split the American people into opposing factions, unable to combine or cooperate in opposition to the on going fascist take over of our country.  Fascists have been trying to take over the U.S. almost since the inception of Fascism.  In 1933 Fascists plotted to overthrow the U.S. government and replace the President with a Dictator.  [The Business Plot (1933)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Plot)  >""When and if fascism comes to America it will not be labeled 'made in Germany'; it will not be marked with a swastika; it will not even be called fascism; it will be called, of course, 'Americanism.'"" - Halford E. Luccock (1938)  >The symptoms of fascist thinking are colored by environment and adapted to immediate circumstances. But always and everywhere they can be identified by their appeal to prejudice and by the desire to play upon the fears and vanities of different groups in order to gain power. It is no coincidence that the growth of modern tyrants has in every case been heralded by the growth of prejudice. It may be shocking to some people in this country to realize that, without meaning to do so, they hold views in common with Hitler when they preach discrimination against other religious, racial or economic groups. Likewise, many people whose patriotism is their proudest boast play Hitler's game by retailing distrust of our Allies and by giving currency to snide suspicions without foundation in fact.  >The American Fascists are most easily recognized by their deliberate perversion of truth and fact. Their newspapers and propaganda carefully cultivate every fissure of disunity, every crack in the common front against fascism. They use every opportunity to impugn democracy. They use isolationism as a slogan to conceal their own selfish imperialism.  >They cultivate hate and distrust [of allies]. They claim to be super-patriots, but they would destroy every liberty guaranteed by the Constitution. They demand free enterprise, but are the spokesmen for monopoly and vested interest. Their final objective toward which all their deceit is directed is to capture political power so that, using the power of the State and the power of the market simultaneously they may keep the common man in eternal subjection. - Henry A. Wallace, Vice President, USA, 1944.

"If parents disagree with what public schools teach they can either pay for private school or homeschool their kids.

No books that have mixed race people in them? No children's stories about blended families, single parents, or non traditional families? How about orphans? Adoption? Different religions? Other languages? What if a different country has a culture I don't like? Can I just demand a school never address that country in any way?    Education is not just the memorizing of facts.

LGBTQ people isn’t a theology like religion is. To an extent, people can’t choose what they believe. I get that. But being lgbtq is so inherent to a persons identity. That’s something they CANT choose.   So the idea of having a book where a kid has two moms is the exact same is having a book with a kid whose parents are interracial. It just shows kids “hey, this exists and is okay”.   Take Mormonism for example, where interracial marriage is not a sin anymore, but is still scrutinized. Would it be okay for a parent to take their kid out of a classroom of a book that mentions interracial marriage because of their religion?   The further we allow religion to seep into the classroom, the more things will be banned. There was a whole boom of Harry Potter books being demonized by very religious people. Should we remove those from a classroom as well?   I’m just trying to prove that this is a scary slope, and it’s not right for parents to remove their children from ideas and people that exist. It’s not like they’re having children think about their sexuality. It’s just showing that people can love others in a way that isn’t just straight.",Scott_does_art,2025-04-24T20:06:54,10

But being lgbtq is so inherent to a persons identity. That’s something they CANT choose.   To your first point: they could argue but physics, biology and chemistry is science based. They have right to believe there is a guy with beard in heaven, but science materials/papers are scientific facts. That's it. They have right to disagree, right to not believe, but science is science and school is place for science. Church for theology. If they don't like science, they can send their kid to chruch schools or something (you have stuff like that in US I think).  To your second point: it is ideology as they believe there is more than two genders for example, while from science perspective, chromosomes are the ones that biologically define your gender. It's DNA package, you can't change that. Ignoring it won't make it go away. It's fact. Now again, like above, you have right to identify as you want, believe what you want, live as you want.   In both cases live as you want and don't try to tell others how they should live.  But school in both cases is for science and factually, scientific proven subjects.   Rest should stay in home/family as I don't really care what you believe in home. But my kid in school is going there to learn math or chemistry, not X or Y believes of X or Y group of people.   I belive everyone can cooexist as long as they mind their business. Problem starts when either side tries to sell their believes are ""right"" and say others are ""wrong"".

Yes, heteronormativity is a fact, becasue guess what - that's what vast majority of humans will always be becasue that's how genetic code work. Nobody pushes anything just because it's the most common, normal, vanilla/default thing humanity knows. Homosexuality will always be minority and more odd thing simple becasue of statistics of how many % of humanity is born gay. That's also a fact that nothing will ever change.  I support equal rights/laws for gay people and oppose discrimination in the eyes of law but don't wave victim card like that just becasue majority of materials about humanity will always be aimed for majority of humanity.

You realize it has nothing to do with promoting anything? It's just that these books are old (mostly old simple child stories) and show the most common thing these kids can relate to. But it doesn't teach that this is the only good thing or that gay is not good. Its just a book about something else. Only 9.3% of USA population identifies as LGBTQ. And it's much less is other countries. Obviously kids will naturally see way more of hetero things around since that's 90-95% of humanity since that's default how we are genetically programmed to procreate.  But there is big difference in intention. Books you mentioned in kingergarden has no intention of sexually educating kids in KINGERGARTEN. Nobody ever wrote them with that in mind. That's just false propaganda (which leads us to ideology). It's just stories about stuff (like Snow White) that happens to be hetero since that always will be default, cause you know - spieces need to have off springs and 95% of humanity will be like that since as you said - you are born gay, you don't become one.   But putting there books about gay couples has different goal - to teach such little kids about sexuality. It has no place in school, especially in kindergarten. Leave at home with parents.
