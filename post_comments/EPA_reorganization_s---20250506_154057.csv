">*EPA is getting rid of the two offices that are primarily responsible for regulating climate and air pollution.*  >*The move to eliminate the Office of Atmospheric Protection (OAP) and Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) by the end of the fiscal year signals a likely end to much of the agency‚Äôs climate work. EPA political appointees announced the reorganization plan during a Friday town hall with employees of the Office of Air and Radiation, which houses both OAP and OAQPS.*  >*EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin will likely move programs to curb smog, soot and toxic emissions into other offices. But most of OAP‚Äôs work seems destined for the dust bin ‚Äî including a program that requires the country‚Äôs biggest polluters to report their greenhouse gas emissions.*  >*The reorganization plan announced Friday* [*also includes axing the Office of Research and Development*](https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2025/05/02/trump-admin-launches-major-overhaul-of-epa-00324465)*, a centralized arm for research and science that employs over 1,500 people. While Congress could block the reorganization, former EPA officials from both Democratic and Republican administrations said that was unlikely; the plan only requires general approval by appropriations committees, not enacting legislation.*  >*EPA did not respond to inquiries about the changes to OAR. But Project 2025, which has proved influential in President Donald Trump‚Äôs second term, calls for OAR to shift away from greenhouse gas regulations and instead focus on ‚Äúlimiting and minimizing criteria and hazardous air pollutants in partnership with the states.‚Äù*  >*EPA will still need to maintain some staff to work on climate regulations. But it is working to drop greenhouse gases from its list of regulated pollutants by reconsidering a 2009 scientific finding that underpins all Clean Air Act climate regulations.*  >*On Friday, EPA also sent the White House Office of Management and Budget proposals to repeal Biden-era rules for power plant carbon and mercury ‚Äî without replacing them.*",mom0nga,2025-05-06T15:43:36,3

"Does anyone remember when conservatives believed in ‚Äòconserving‚Äô the environment and natural resources? Me either, but I wish I could. Teddy Roosevelt greatly expanded the national park system and Richard Nixon established the EPA, both of which this administration are currently tearing apart.

Perfect timing. Currently the US has had some of the most calm weather over the past decade. Florida and much of the South. The Midwest... Some of the calmest weather on record. Mission Accomplished. üçø,williamgman,2025-05-06T19:28:05,1

They‚Äôre getting rid of the people in the way of turning the swaths of unused land in the US into toxic manufacturing facilities since we‚Äôre losing trade partners and the ‚ÄòAmerican first‚Äô ideology has taken root.
