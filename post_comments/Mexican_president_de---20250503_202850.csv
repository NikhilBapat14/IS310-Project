Mexican government *is* the cartels.,whippingboy4eva,2025-05-03T21:04:46,384
Mexico isn’t for sale because she’s already bought and paid for by the cartels.  It’s their biggest export.,j3remy2007,2025-05-03T20:35:48,158
"No matter what angle you look at it, this is a massive problem for Mexico and their denial of help shows sympathy towards the Cartels. They have been bought out top to bottom.",ExpertCatJuggler,2025-05-03T20:49:45,227
That would be a massive hit to their GDP.,f1seb,2025-05-03T20:36:15,92
Anyone paying the least bit attention to Mexico’s politics should know that the Cartel runs the show. But American legacy media doesn’t cover it and the majority of Americans aren’t curious about what’s actually going on with our neighbors.,IamYourBestFriendAMA,2025-05-03T21:01:52,70
Any half decent leader of a country would have said the same.   Now what she needs to do is just look the other way while Special Forces takes them out. Bonus points for blaming a rival cartel for the deaths.   Win. Win.,Key-Monk6159,2025-05-03T21:12:15,35
"Maybe we should just wall off the entire country? I’m talking no entrances, treat it as the Korean DMZ.",thesysadmn,2025-05-04T10:10:51,7
"Like I said in the other post, cartels are like serial killers. They are pure evil. When they are not trying to take each other out, they are taking innocents out in the most grotesque ways imaginable. Sending 44 military won’t do anything. You have to take the big ones out first, like the Sinaloa or CJN, each territory in Mexico has a cartel that covers that territory. Right now, they are at war with each other somewhere. I spent a little time of at Narco clips sub, it’s almost like nothing affects these guys. They get locked up and along comes more recruits. They can take cartels down if they want to. Los Zetas are largely gone,  even though they have been replaced with the Northwest Cartel. They are not nearly as horrible.",Dazzling_Pink9751,2025-05-03T21:42:32,17
"To go against the cartels in mexico, and I mean really going against them, is either political suicide or real suicide",Dutchtdk,2025-05-03T21:30:14,17
Its gonna happen some day its inevitable. Nobody wants to do it but something has to be done.,Jurclassic5,2025-05-03T21:12:06,10
Trusting the Mexican government's words here is like trusting the words of a bank robber's hostage. Few of them want to put their lives or the lives of their loved ones at risk.  We need to liberate Mexico and trust that their politicians speak a different tune behind closed doors. This isn't Afghanistan where you have a large civilian population that legitimately wanted religious fundamentalist rule. Nobody wants to be ruled by drug cartels.  Kicking this problem down the road is only going to create a worse problem when cartels acquire better technology to engage in asymmetrical warfare.,Magehunter_Skassi,2025-05-03T21:25:43,10
What a weird way to slip and say she endorses them. She clearly has never had any control over them.,Velocipot,2025-05-03T20:32:31,3
"He gave them a chance to decide for themselves, now they will live with the consequences.",jcr2022,2025-05-03T21:07:46,2
I imagine the Mexican President wouldn't be alive for much longer if he'd agreed to it.,ThrowawayMonster9384,2025-05-03T20:58:12,-2
"However, Kelly said Mexico must do more to protect Americans from dangerous foreign terrorist organizations and ""the drugs and violence they flood into communities on both sides of the border.""  ""We will continue exploring ways to enhance our efforts across the region to dismantle these transnational criminal organizations,"" she wrote. ""We will make America safe again.""",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-05-03T20:55:01,0
Then they can take the cartels on themselves. They just don’t want to.,LurkerNan,2025-05-03T21:25:19,1

"I know an ex cartel member local cops will not Approach, acknowledge, or attempt to arrest cartel members. Only the military will but they will only show up when they know for 100% certain that multiple members will be somewhere which means they were tipped off. The local cops and politicians are paid and scared.",Hobbyfarmtexas,2025-05-03T22:17:39,77
"No, but they enable them. Go look at the movie on Netflix called Somo. What happened in 2011 with Los Zetas was absolutely horrific.",Dazzling_Pink9751,2025-05-03T21:34:30,-18
Bought? Nah. They let her live. Why pay someone off when you can just threaten them? Plata o plomo became just plomo o plomo a long time ago.,cathbadh,2025-05-04T06:24:50,11
"If I remember correctly, last Mexican presidential election any candidate that was anti-cartel was assassinated. Even if they aren’t bought out, they comply out of fear.",-deteled-,2025-05-03T22:17:06,88
"And they have run it for years, decades probably. They give to and build up the community to show how beneficial they are, meanwhile they go around threating homeowners into monthly payments so they'll be left alone. Taking the cartel down would start with dirty cops, then the actual members then political leaders.",North-Currency-1572,2025-05-03T21:39:13,19
"I don’t necessarily disagree. But I think there’s nothing wrong with asking your neighbor, who’s the largest military power to ever exist, for help. Otherwise I hope they have come to terms with that the blood is now on their hands. There stands a difference between a conventional Iraq type invasion, and letting in the most lethal gunslinging best resource equipped operators to deal with an organized crime problem. I feel as if the denial of help now puts the scale of possible involvement in US hands instead of Mexican.",ExpertCatJuggler,2025-05-03T21:29:57,6

They are ALL on the payroll.  El Chapo Guzmen stuff exposed that.,Hulluck22,2025-05-04T08:06:50,10
Also the election that she won a vast majority of other candidates were all murdered by the cartels. She was allowed to live and win for likely  one of if not both reasons:   A. She isn't a threat or B. She's basically on the payroll in some form.,A_Hatless_Casual,2025-05-03T22:35:13,48
If politicians can’t make policy then the country is failed.,ExpertCatJuggler,2025-05-03T22:43:19,16
">But I think there’s nothing wrong with asking your neighbor, who’s the largest military power to ever exist, for help.  There's nothing wrong with it, but if you openly say something like that as a politician in Mexico, you risk a cartel hitman doing a driveby on your granddaughter (or far worse if they're captured).  34 Mexican politicians got whacked in 2024 during their election season, the bloodiest in their history. The cartels are the graitutiously evil organizations in the world, and the whole Santa Muerte shit even seems like something pulled out of an edgy fantasy novel.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-05-03T22:25:15,16
">. But I think there’s nothing wrong with asking your neighbor, who’s the largest military power to ever exist, for help.  Hard to ask for help when the consequences are receiving a box with the head and privates of one of your loved ones in it.   There's a very good possibility that she does approve any strikes while denouncing them publicly. She has a tightrope to walk here.",cathbadh,2025-05-04T06:28:43,1
I’d say Mexico is on the cusp of being a failed country.,-deteled-,2025-05-03T22:58:48,24
"Thats a huge problem though. You can’t accept your own elected leaders living in fear of a gang as the norm.  At some point, someone in Mexico is going to have to be the leader needed to fix this. Unfortunately I don’t think itll happen anytime soon.",dunkeater,2025-05-03T23:23:00,11
Mexico is a failed state. Their government is only operating at the whims of the cartels.,RossBot5000,2025-05-03T23:48:58,28
