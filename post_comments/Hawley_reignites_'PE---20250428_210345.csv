Josh Hawley is a lot like RFK in that he’ll occasionally hit on something that really resonates and makes a lot of sense. But the bullshit you have to deal with most of the rest of the time just make him unworkable as a good faith cross-aisle partner.,TSAOutreachTeam,2025-04-28T21:07:38,99
I’m all for a bill like this but Hawley is only pushing it as a means to smear the dems. It’s about as slimy as you’d expect from him.,irishnugget,2025-04-28T21:30:26,15

Let's not post sources that calls its own viewers cousin fucking terrorist and had to pay almost one billion dollars for lying about the election. No one thinks fox news viewers are dumber than fox news thinks they are.,The_Navy_Sox,2025-04-28T21:11:42,10
Most Republicans also do Insider Trading too.,ZillaSlayer54,2025-04-28T21:04:39,19
Not the Marjorie Taylor Greene Act?,FormerUsenetUser,2025-04-29T00:27:41,4
I would like to reignite the ‘HAWLEY Act’ a push to ban lawmakers from being anything like the phony Sen. Josh Hawley. Have you ever seen the guy try kissing his wife? I’ve seen gorillas act more natural at an opera.,heismanwinner82,2025-04-28T21:10:38,10
There have been 5 of these Acts proposed by Dems by Republicans and by Bipartisan initiatives. None of them pass because they're either full of shit or they rely on Congress overseeing themselves in regards to the laws of the Act.   There needs to be a Bipartisan act passed specifically banning members of Congress AND their spouses from buying and selling stocks and ensure that the oversight is outside of their immediate scope.,ForcesBurnCrosses,2025-04-28T22:15:25,3
"Stupid name, good idea. But not if it’s “rules for thee not for me” like we know it’ll be. It should be all of them",Lostsock1995,2025-04-29T01:05:56,3
"So, Josh is concerned about MTG and all those Republicans insider-trading when Donnie did the Tariffs-On, Tariffs-Off stock market manipulation?",Karuna56,2025-04-29T01:07:26,3
"Empty virtue signalling.  Naming it the Pelosi Act just shows this is a stunt designed to go nowhere.  If he wanted it to pass, he'd be courting Democrats not insulting them.  Hawley is just positioning himself as Trump's successor.",1-Ohm,2025-04-29T05:43:26,4
"It's little more than a Troll. Call it what it is and maybe it can goad the Republican majority in the house and Senate into passing it. And to the Republican president for a signature into law, with an ideologically aligned Supreme Court giving their blessing on the legality of it.  In other words, the only barriers standing in the way of this are Republicans.",localistand,2025-04-28T21:55:53,3
All for show. Stocks are where they all make their dishonest bucks. Even Pelosi wouldn’t back her own bill when it came time.,Flat-Emergency4891,2025-04-29T06:07:11,3
Insider trading is already illegal under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10 and neither make any exceptions for members of Congress. Maybe Hawley should bother to read a fucking statute first.,AlexKingstonsGigolo,2025-04-28T21:48:40,5
"Call his bluff, even with a Republican trifecta, they still won't have the votes to pass it. This bill is just a partisan dig and does nothing to help the country.",Raul1024,2025-04-28T22:30:12,3
Every so often someone pushes a bill like this and it goes nowhere.  I can't think of a way this would ever really get passed.,Weekly-Trash-272,2025-04-28T21:10:42,2
"Don't give him any credit. This is all performative bullshit. It will be shelved or shot down by people in his own party.   And do you think any of these assholes would follow it if passed and signed? The GOP would look the other way when their own do it, and go after any Democrat that sells a single penny stock.  Yes, I know it's disgusting for any member, but be real... only one side will have 30 committee hearings while the other side skates.",Devistator,2025-04-29T00:21:53,2

Now if he could only hit on the proper airport codes to catch a flight to the state he is supposed to represent.   This dude is so desperate to become president. It’s tragically hilarious.,JahoclaveS,2025-04-29T00:53:44,4
