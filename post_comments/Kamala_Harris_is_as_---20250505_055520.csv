"Judging by the speech, it seems Harris has learned nothing from her epic defeat to Trump in last year‚Äôs presidential race. She seemed as incapable as ever of offering a cogent, unifying message for a party that is now in disarray.  Instead, she went heavy on meaningless platitudes ‚Äì ‚Äòthe one power that must not fail‚Äô, she said, before a long dramatic pause, ‚Äòis the voice of the people‚Äô. And she continued to indulge progressives‚Äô fantasy that they are the good guys, the people who fight for truth, justice and the American way. In truth, we all know they are the lunatics who support things like tax-payer-funded sex changes for prisoners and illegal migrants.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-05-05T06:03:48,49

"I mean, it really is what she does best.  I was truly impressed when she tapped Walz as her VP as he was almost as cringey as she is.  Truly impressive.",cathbadh,2025-05-05T18:44:47,3

"""The voice of the people"" was heard at the ballot box on Nov 5th. And it didn't call for Kamala Harris.",social_dinosaur,2025-05-05T08:06:53,45
So you‚Äôre saying she gives a free win to the opposer right?,the445566x,2025-05-05T17:57:16,4
‚ÄúSocial_dinosaur‚Ä¶. Exactly right. Barack Hussein said it best:  Elections have consequences!  So true!,Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-05-05T08:14:49,4
