"Steve Deace.  Blaze media.  Converted to some type of ‚ÄúChristianity‚Äù in 2003 after attending a Promise Keeper meeting.  Man as a superior/head of household is their main schtick.  Not a fan of women having equal rights. Birds of a feather. Flock together.  Very unpopular on Reddit, perhaps, but misogyny along with a bunch of other unsavory crap is a pillar of this administration.",Historical_Bend_2629,2025-05-04T13:56:03,30

You‚Äôre 100% correct.  Americans are fucking loons right now. I‚Äôve never expected to see my friends and family members so brainwashed. They‚Äôre not even on this plain of reality.

The hell does the Quran have to do with the rampant sexism and misogyny in the Bible? I never said the Bible was the most sexist book ever written. It‚Äôs most certainly the most widely-distributed blatantly sexist book ever written though; I don‚Äôt mind giving it that title.  ‚ÄúYeah but other holy text sexist too‚Äù isn‚Äôt the argument you seem to think it is.,musical_bear,2025-05-04T22:55:15,6
