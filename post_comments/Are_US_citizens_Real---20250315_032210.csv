"A majority of Americans are upset at the change of alliances, and are aghast at the prospects of the talk of annexation of Canada Greenland and Panama. We are watching with astonishment, fear, and worry that our county is becoming a rogue state.",hoodiedoo,2025-03-15T18:59:29,383

No.  Putin has been working on brainwashing America for decades. He's a criminal and a murderer. I wish for better things for Russia but I have no interest in a toxic relationship with Putin.,AdhesivenessCivil581,2025-03-15T18:52:03,50
Elected officials are. I haven’t met any trump supporters that I’m related to who are supportive of allying with Russia. Most have just gone quiet at this point about any foreign policy since Afghanistan is done.,palmettoswoosh,2025-03-15T18:44:53,64
The typical American is fairly dumbfounded by the apparent willingness of Trump and other high ranking Republicans to seek reconciliation with the Russians and we suspect that perhaps Russia has bought its way into the Republican Party or provided them with other valuable services.,davejjj,2025-03-15T19:04:33,29
I used to be a Trump supporter. I absolutely despise everything going on right now. George W Bush tried to be friendly with Putin and it backfired.   The meeting with Zelenskyy was an absolute embarrassment. The trade wars are embarrassing. It sucks when literally everyone is pissed at you. There are some people in this country that try to throw shade in Zelenskyy’s direction to try to justify Trump’s recent moves.   We are a gigantic melting pot of a country full of diverse views. Topics like this are difficult to discuss/debate in a receptive manner so that’s often why you see people from Reddit refer to “the divide” in our country.,slims_shady,2025-03-15T18:54:45,87
"Most of the public and the entire expert community/academia and political establishment are steadfastly against icing out Europe and warming up to Russia. Many MAGA diehards will side with Trump, because they didn't have strong feelings about the matter in the first place, and they don't want to betray their cult leader. But for most Americans who voted for Trump, it was for reasons altogether different than cozying up to Putin.  Sec. of State Marco Rubio himself is no doubt internally screaming about all of this. But he'd rather have his job on his resume for a 2028 presidential run, than do what he knows is right, and so he does Trump's bidding.",TheOvy,2025-03-15T18:55:46,18

And we don’t want to distance ourselves from Europe. We just want to stop footing the bill for everyone else, that’s really all it is. We want things to be fair and even in terms of contribution. An alliance should be just that. Both sides doing things to benefit one another.   In regards to Canada, I don’t even understand where the whole “51st state” idea spawned from.

"No.  We consider Russia The Main Adversary, even more than China, who is more of an economic threat.  The Republican party, in it's pre fascist version, was strongly anti Russia.  Ronald Reagan is given credit for the destruction of the USSR, notably triggering an East German posted Russian KGB agent named Putin when the Wall fell.  This resulted in a very long term effort to compromise the US Government.  Executives were recorded and blackmailed.  One of them was a NY Real Estate guy, who made a LOT of money laundering the ill gotten gains of many Eastern Europeans who stole from their nations when the USSR fell.  I lived in NY  in the 80's- when our current Occupant was just an annoying person on the Social pages of the newspaper...he was never presidential, and he hasn't changed, he has only gotten senile and more evil.  He was funny in the newspaper, but is a fucking tragedy in power....and I have no idea (well, a few theories) how he got in a second time when we KNEW what a shitshow he was.  Russia hacked the Democratic emails and the Republican emails.  They released the Democratic emails but KEPT the Republican ones for future use/kompromat.  A combination of our Confederacy (ex-slave states) and the compromised Occupant of the White House allowed others to take over (see Project 2025).  They all have different motives and backgrounds but all want to kill the Federal Government.  Occupant 47 appointed the least qualified and most dangerous people below him.  His goal is absolute loyalty.  Problem is he is crazy - age demented - himself, so he is being played by all the players-playing him.  A typical American sees Russia as an adversary, and problem for Europe, which is why we have spent so much money on NATO.  This isn't a controversy for 97% of us....we had no problem arming Ukraine and giving them world's best satellite intel.  Occupant - 47 is both a sociopath and compromised.  The party he leads is no longer ""conservative"" as described by classic US political theory...it is a combination of hard right, religious zealots, and with a major assist by Russia in money, social media support, and political actions, be they palestine protests on US campus, or by migrants suddenly showing up on the Mexican border, almost like they were cued up.  Russia has succeeded beyond their wildest dreams.  They own the office of President.  He gives them intel, assistance, and now, with Zelenskyy, clearly will put on propaganda productions for Russia.  That was disgusting  and unprofessional on so many levels....not what we expect from our highest office, no matter the party in power.  No Army, not a single bullet fired, probably cost less than one aircraft carrier....the best coup in world history.",StandupJetskier,2025-03-15T19:40:28,16

"There are a few different factors that meld together and cause Trump's party to be pro-Russia.  There is an enormous amount of pro-Russia propaganda that spreads throughout social media and certain subsets of the Republican party. While on Fox News, Tucker Carlson constantly spread conspiracy theories regarding globalists like Soros trying to replace white people in this country. He would also spread messaging suggesting that Russia is okay and that NATO is to blame for the war starting. After being fired from Fox News, he still continues to spread misinformation saying things like Ukraine's president is a dictator and that they are selling our weapons to Mexican cartels and stealing the cash for themselves, hence why we should abandon them and let Russia take over. Nearly everything Tucker says on his program is misinformation. It is unfortunate that he maintains a huge audience and has a big influence on the current administration.  It doesn't even have to be blatantly pro-Putin to be useful for their purposes. Amplifying anti-globalist and isolationist voices is equally as useful as being pro-Russia. If you can trick people into thinking that it's *always* bad for the U.S. to do anything abroad, to have alliances, to have free trade, or to intervene anywhere. Then you can play into this angle to say that the U.S. should drop support for Ukraine and let them sort it out themselves. To be fair, the United States has abused its position as world police in the past century and has made horrible mistakes. But this doesn't mean it is now impossible for the U.S. to ever do the right thing. Ukraine did nothing wrong and is being invaded by an imperialist Russia that wants to annex its territory. It is clear as day to anyone that they must be stopped.  Pulling back from our allies in general is an enormous mistake. Economically we are reliant on each for cheaper goods and efficient supply chains. The notion that the United States can raise tariffs on everyone and become completely self-sufficient is unbelievably ignorant and foolish. We are destined to have the stock market continue to crash, for inflation to rise, and for people to suffer for a while until Trump's support finally declines.",kittysloth,2025-03-15T19:09:03,5

Anyone who watched him and Putin at Helsinki should know he is subservient to Putin. Europe is wise to make its own independent foreign policy without the US and trump.

"Not broadly.  Remember we have a first past the post two party (in reality) system. This means people with wildly different views choose between two candidates.  First of all Trump wasn't fully open about what he'd do with Ukraine/Russia before the election though it was obvious to me.  secondly let's say 10% of people voted for him because of inflation, another 20% because they hate dems, another 20% because they support Russia and want Ukraine funding to end.  the other 50% because they wanted woke/DEI gone.  I'm obviously simplifying things and not talking about people supporting more than one issue or how they weight the different issues, but i'm just trying to illustrate the issue.  So Trump got less than 50% of the total votes cast in the country. In fact he got 31.43% of registered voters in the US (turnout was approx 67%).  So If my % were right then 20% of 31% of americans voted for him to end funding to Ukraine and  support russia. That would be 6.29%  Obviously those aren't real numbers at all. i'm sure the numbers were higher than that.  But i'm pointing out how Trump can be elected even knowing his policy on this issue but it doesn't mean americans support it.  Now MAGA and the GOP tends to take their view from Trump so the more openly he's against Ukraine the more they fall in line, so the numbers opposing ukraine are higher than even when he was elected.  Currently support is down to 52% for Ukraine, 44% against and 4% for Russia (wtf).

No. Keep in mind that Trump won the election only by around 2M out of 155M votes.

I remember this was clearly one of the promises he clearly made. So why are Americans surprised US is leaving Ukraine in deep trouble ? - He clearly said as well that Europeans  were not paying for their protection and he would retaliate.

I think that you are underestimating the amount of apathy in the United States. Donald Trump won the election with 51% of the population voting for him. That means of course that 49% of the voting population did not vote for him. The number of eligible voters who did not vote is tremendous. There is always a large percentage of eligible voters who will not bother to vote in any election   it amazes me because the results of elections actually do influence their environment and how they live,Economy-Following-31,2025-03-16T03:54:21,2

"I think very few US citizens are really pro-Russia as such, for a while Trump has been selling a few narratives that are relevant here.  One is that America in general should stop being involved in foreign wars (except for the ones he likes, somehow this contradiction doesn't come up); another is that Europe doesn't contribute enough to NATO and essentially is a free rider taking advantage of America in defense and not giving much in return.  So maybe in a sense that's pro-Russian with extra steps.  (I don't personally find this line of argument compelling, but as far as I can tell this is what it is.)",Hartastic,2025-03-16T09:16:49,2

And based on all the reporting done on Russian interference in our elections over at least the past decade and the playbook Russia uses to oppress its own people, which we are experiencing here (e.g. creating an environment that fosters an inability to discern facts and truth with certainty), and based on all the know connections between Donald and the Russian mafia (effectively an arm of the FSB), I personally have no doubt that we’re living through the end game of a Russian psyop.   If we make it through this moment in our history in one peace, I think we’ll need to do a thorough study on what caused the pacification of Americans in this moment.

"I think America shares a closer cultural connection to Europe than Russia. I’m saddened by the recent falling out. However, I do recognize that there is a reason why “America First” resonates with people. For the last several decades, it seems our politicians have seriously neglected the needs of their own citizens in order to prop up a U.S. empire that seemingly exists to protect the assets of the wealthiest people on the globe. The US has essentially just become a global LLC. It now risks falling apart from the inside out.   And ultimately, I do believe that Asia is more of a pressing geopolitical battleground that requires our attention. For better or for worse, Europe just needs to become self-reliant and able to defend itself from encroaching authoritarian regimes. The U.S. needs to focus on domestic issues in order to avoid significant political strife at home. We just don’t have the bandwidth to be the world’s police anymore.",suitupyo,2025-03-16T11:00:33,2
"It's not surprising, in any way, that Trump was elected.  1. Ignorance. 2. Poor education. 3. Lack of basic current affairs and geopolitical knowledge ( compared to your average European).  These three points alone are a recipe for an electorate too ""dumb"" to make an informed decision and are liable to believe anything that comes from the Right.  Take the amount of Americans who are religious. No offence, but evangelicalism often walks hand-in-hand with gullibility. The broad cross-country European electorate tend to be better educated, secular, and most importantly, cynical.  All of us have met the stereotypically gullible American. These tend to be Right-leaning, Republican/MAGA/GOP affiliated, white and Christian. There's your Trump base right there.  The Democrats ( who are actually considered right of centre in European eyes) became complacent and suffered from their Superiority complex which the more ""simple"" American hates.  This is as much the Democrat's fault.   The biggest mistake currently being made is underestimating the resolve of Europe to push on and become a massive force to be reckoned with.  We've been waiting years for an excuse to flex our potential, and Americans have given that excuse to us on a silver platter.

Trump is worshipped by grassroots MAGA and adored by most Republicans who see him as Reagon II, though he differs from Reagan. Astonishingly, those he insulted and financially harmed still prefer him over Biden and Obama. It’s a mad world.

No one in this world should allow something like this to happen. One thing I noticed is how some people are trying to make Ukraine look like the bad guy. I just don't see this.

Putin knew no greater foreign ally than Obama, and nothing backfired more than his nonlethal aid policy with Ukraine that he even stubbornly stuck to after Russia invaded in 2014.  Just look at the 2012 debate when Romney rightfully claimed Russia was our greatest geopolitical threat as Obama just mocked the notion:  >“When you were asked, ‘What’s the biggest geopolitical threat facing America,’ you said ‘Russia.’ Not al Qaeda; you said Russia,” Obama said. “And, the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back, because the Cold War’s been over for 20 years.”  https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/22/politics/mitt-romney-russia-ukraine/index.html  If only Obama would run to Ukraine’s defense as he did there with Putin.

All because we wanted to be friends with Putin, and Biden isn’t much better making a family business out of selling influence to them.  Russia would have rolled over Ukraine and be working on their next invasion now if we didn’t reverse that  horrible nonlethal aid policies in late 2017.    https://thehill.com/policy/international/365906-trump-administration-approves-lethal-arms-sales-to-ukraine/  Trump gave Ukraine three years of stockpiling and training with modern defensive weaponry that they used to great effect holding Russia at bay.

The US considers the project a security risk to Europe.  https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50875935  Yet Biden lifted those sanctions and the ones targeting Putin’s allies:  >The Biden administration has waived sanctions on a company building a controversial gas pipeline between Russia and Germany.

But you know who talked shit about Denmark without provocation, questioned it territorial integrity and made fun of them? Trump. Who started to talk shit about Zelensky and called him a depot? Who sayed that the EU (consiting only of US allies) was only created to screw the USA (which is a proposterous statement) and spread a lot of other nonsense about us in the past months. All of that was Trump, president of the USA. But again, if some European politician does it it´s a problem? What kind of hypocrisy is this?  Most of the big players of Europe have been very loyal towards the USA during the Cold War and afterwards and some of the most important military bases are located in European countries.  And besides, what countries are talking shit about America? And even then, what kind of justification is that to abandon your allies? Is the American pride this brittle?  And lastly, most of your argument just sounds like you see Europe as a US vassal. ""How dare they to critizise us?

"I did a little write up to a comment that asked a comment that asked a similar question but I’ll list a few things:   The huge turning point was the insurrection on January 6th. I love my country and seeing all that go down really opened my eyes. It saddened me the next couple of days as I started seeing through it all and it changed my mind tremendously.   A thing I wouldn’t do is belittle someone who is a Trump supporter. I was called many things while I supported Trump. Racist. Uneducated. You can imagine the stereotypical names people can generalize with that crowd. All of those made me double down.   Even though it’s getting more difficult by the day, don’t compare him to Hitler. Our media has a tendency to compare anyone aggressive/dangerous to Hitler and that was another thing that drove me crazy. Yes I know Elon has been doing the Nazi salute… but they have their base convinced that he was doing a “My heart goes out to you” signal. Also Elon has a tendency to be a troll so a lot of Trump fans give him a pass thinking he was trolling libs or it was his autism (even though I know many on the spectrum and that is not a side effect.   One of the most convincing of times that would make me question things is I have a friend that is very very left leaning. He has a very calm demeanor though. He lives states away but would come back to town a couple times a year. The couple of times he would invite me over and we watch a movie or something relaxing but usually we would end the nights talking politics.   Now these talks, he would always treat my opinion like it mattered. I talked to some people and I would tell them something Trump said and they would immediately disregard it. I always felt our conversations were safe to where I could talk about whatever I felt/believed. I didn’t have to put on a stubborn Trump act or be prepared to get defensive.   Some of the most eye opening conversations were about other politicians that weren’t Trump. Trump is the face of the movement. You won’t convince them that he is evil, racist, or even dumb. Though most will say he puts his foot in his mouth but in an embarrassing uncle sort of way. For example Matt Gaetz is one we would both rag on. I wasn’t convinced overnight but the seeds of doubt in the party were planted.   The biggest takeaway is make these conversations be in a comfortable setting. Don’t try to randomly spring facts on them. There’s a billion pro Trump influencers on Facebook/Tik Tok/Youtube right now that will spout nonsense that they will pull up just to divert your point or believe that lie just to prove your anti Trump fact wrong.   Scoot down to their level, let them believe that you are listening (you don’t have to say you agree but simple answers like “Oh I didn’t think about it like that” go a long way of establishing a conversational bond to where they can trust you to influence them politically). Hypotheticals or bringing up situations that happen in opposing countries can be effective because they won’t feel like you are attacking their personal beliefs and the walls won’t come up.   I hope all this helps. I’m no expert. I just tried to think of the little things that I appreciated that led to me changing my mind down the road.  Oh and just remember, if they are anything like I was…. They are people that are ill informed and passionately patriotic and/or religiously tied to this belief. If someone truly believes that a candidate is definitely the one putting their country on the right path or thinks that this candidate is performing god’s work or in the name of Jesus… They’re mind won’t change overnight. Baby steps are fine in this matter.   If/when they do realize they were wrong about said candidate…. It’s going to hurt. It took me a couple of days to recollect my thoughts, reflect on who I was and what I had been, think about the jargon I had been saying to other people. Your trust in the system gets very shaken. It might seem like I’m being dramatic but it’s definitely difficult.",slims_shady,2025-03-16T01:12:56,22

" So I was in college when Trump ran in 2016. I have friends that are across the board on the political spectrum. I had talked to all of them about election races before without issue. I always felt it was a healthy atmosphere because it was never an echo chamber. We all respected each other’s difference of opinion. This changed in 2016.   There were a few things that drew me to Trump. One of the big ones was him “sticking up for law enforcement” (my uncle was a cop and I was also a jailer during this time). I also liked the fact that he wasn’t a politician. Maybe he could get elected and right a few wrongs… who knows?  What started as a “I know he’s a billionaire but I can relate to a few things he’s talking about” became deeper. Some of my “friends” on the left side of the spectrum became pretty hostile.   So during this time, I was never one to try to get confrontational about politics. Me and my friends consistently joked about politics. We saw everyone else get heated/upset and we thought of it as silly. We thought we were better than that.   One called me a “fucking dumbass” and asked if I was retarded as soon I said the words “I think I’m considering Trump.” It wasn’t in a manner that’s ribbing a friend, his face was blood red and he looked like he wanted to fight. The weirdest escalation I’ve ever experienced. This friend later told me he never wanted to talk to me again. I awkwardly just said “Okay”. We had been friends since we were 8 and then we just quit talking for five years.   The whole Kaepernick kneeling during the national anthem thing was going on during this time. My grandpa fought in the Korean War and was always very against damaging the flag or not standing for the national anthem. He had lost a lot of friends during the war and he had told me that he treated that moment as a time to honor his lost friends.   I know that another member of the military told Kaepernick that he fought for his right to not stand during the national anthem. I also know my grandpa doesn’t speak for the entire military just like the guy who talked to Kaepernick doesn’t. It was a moment I didn’t like but I never bit anyone’s head off because the difference of values of different people. We brought this subject up in class once and I volunteered to give my perspective. One classmate then joked after”I’m for him kneeling because I’m not racist.”  I had one teacher discuss how she loathed Trump because he’s racist but never went into reason. I know the examples were all around during this time but I was doubling down. I was young. To me it was everyone blowing up this one guy into this big scary monster. One classmate brought in a Trump mask and the teacher remarked that “it was absolutely horrifying to see that here.”  Three other friends had me in a group chat and constantly tried sending me facts to sway me. This was probably in good faith but I had so many bad occurrences that I wasn’t going to be swayed by these random facts. I believed Hilary was doing illegal things on her lap top!   Of all my friends on the left, I will give kudos to one. He was very calm and well mannered about our differences. Maybe I showed a bit on the outside but I was bothered by a lot of interactions I have had. Being told constantly for years that you are consciously racist will make anyone bothered. I had a lot of late talks with this friend which helped realize the ruse later.   I’ve put a lot of scenarios down because it wasn’t just one thing that made me double down. There were a lot but a lot of them were from my own environment and had nothing to do with policies themselves. It sucks I stuck with Trump for so long but it was also a great learning moment. Even though I hate him now, I don’t treat Trump supporters with any malice or look down upon them. Nobody likes being called racist even if they have questionable takes. Nobody likes being called uneducated even if they have stupid takes. What changes racist takes and corrects uneducated discussion is understanding conversation. The generalized putdowns made me double down and think everyone else was crazy for a while. I thought the host to The Apprentice was going to save our country lol.   The moment that made me change my tune was the insurrection. I love my country. That broke my heart. It ruined my entire day. Call it buyer’s remorse. Call it whatever you want. I call it realizing I was wrong.   I will not be voting for any MAGA candidate. Calling an election a sham is rebelling against the very thing that our democracy is reliant on.   To antogonize our allies like we are doing is undoing all the sacrifices that my grandpa and many other veterans fought for.   I could go on about much more but I already have written a Harry Potter novel.   Quick summary: I was uneducated. I started to lean to Trump but negative interactions made me even more of a supporter.   P.S. Also the friend that called me a fucking dumbass and everything….

"Let's see if we can go chronological order.  February 10th, 1990 \~ German Chancellor Helmut Kohl assures Russian Government and Soviet Politicians that the scope and span of NATO shall not expand east IF Russia were to agree to let Germany join NATO.  The documented communications have since been declassified and they reflect that this was promised not only by Germany, but by NATO leadership.  The U.S. secretary of state James Baker stated in writing that ""We understand that not only for the Soviet Union, but for other European countries as well it is important to have guarantees that if the United States keeps its presence in Germany within the framework of NATO, not an inch of NATO's present military jurisdiction will spread in an eastern direction"".  So what happened after this?  In 1999 the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, joined NATO as well as the Baltic States in four other countries in 2004, and in 2009 four more.  Georgia and Ukraine were promised membership in NATO but are not yet members.  So not one, two, or three, but twelve times NATO expanded its military jurisdiction eastward and even promised membership to additional countries that border Russia.  So while it's all good and well that many countries have tried to keep a good relationship with Russia, the fact is that NATO defaulted on what they assured Russia would not happen...as did MULTIPLE countries, and yes the U.S. even allowed it.  Now everyone's suddenly shocked that Russia isn't reacting well to it.  The U.S. isn't openly hostile to China, North Korea, or Russia, but if they put together a military jurisdiction agreement and then invited Mexico to join the accord.....you don't imagine that would sit well with the U.S. do you?  Regardless of their intentions, any consolidated world power that claims to have military jurisdiction over a country that sits adjacent to a superpower is not going to blow over into ""Oh well, it's not that big of a deal"".  Regarding which countries talk shit about USA,  Let's start with France, Claude Malhuret, Leader of France's center-right party who called our sitting President a Dictator and compared him to a Roman Emperor after Zelensky lost $100,000,000,000 of aid that we the taxpayers gave to him.  There's a loooooong history of European leadership talking shit about the U.S. while simultaneously contributing a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of the financial contributions necessary and agreed upon by NATO. Meanwhile everyone in the EU is peachy keen about letting the U.S. front the bill to keep defense initiatives up and running.  It would make sense were it the case that NATO countries put forth their fair share, but the fact remains that they haven't and they don't.  And to be fair, it's possible that I do see Europe as a vassal, because the EU sees the U.S. as nothing more than a bank and a military to protect them.  We have an entire ocean between us and anyone who might even appear to be a threat.  NATO only exists because of the threats that exist on THAT side of the ocean....next to Europe.  We're not obligated to expend our resources to serve as the world police....but every time there's a problem...the entire world looks to one Country to be the primary solution factor.  That itself wouldn't be a problem if it weren't the fact that every time someone comes to us begging for help, they turn around and slander us for how we do it.

Democrats didn’t learn from that mistake and tried their infamous Russia Reset Button:  https://www.politico.com/story/2009/03/video-wrong-red-button-019719  The great irony here was the mistranslation “overcharge” was right as they did swindle us yet again.  So badly that Democrats would even trust Putin until he invaded Ukraine TWICE.  Even after Putin took over Crimea they still trusted him and stuck with the nonlethal aid policy despite it being proven to be an abject failure.  The notion that arming Ukraine would provoke Russia was proven utterly false when they invaded anyways.  Apparently at this point the sunk cost was so great they couldn’t admit Russia was our greatest geopolitical threat, but thankfully a Republican administration could and tried to correct course.  Unfortunately it was too late then and we plowed right into this current situation.  I don’t think we are making the same mistake again. Trump puts up a friendly facade with Putin, but no other President in the 21st century has harmed Russia more than he has.  Actions speak louder than words, but Russia would absolutely sign a peace agreement for the right words.  The only way they will end this war is if they are given a decent off-ramp to save face instead of having to carry it out to the bitter end. That is the only leverage we got to salvage this situation as without it Ukraine will inevitably lose.  No amount of assistance will make up for a decade of neglect in an active war zone against a superpower nation.

"I think you are correct about many Americans thinking we spend too much on foreign aid. But I disagree that that's the reason we can't provide universal healthcare. We can afford universal healthcare if we close tax loopholes for billionaires and let medicaid negotiate for lower medication costs and lower medical fees. We have far too many industries with ""investors"" as middle men skimming profit that raises costs AND lowers the amount of money left for companies to pay working employees. Boomers earned amazing pensions and they pulled the rug out from subsequent generations. That was wrong.   And I think too many Americans don't understand the relationship between billionaires, banks, and the tax code like IRC section 1031 that allows the delayed payment if capitol gains if reinvested in a like kind investment. So somebody like Donald Trump can be worth billions but doesn't pay taxes because he doesn't take his capital gains as income. It's permanently delayed because he just increases what he's investing in. But that's not taxable.  So let's say I form an LLC to ""invest"". With secret friends we gather the funds to buy a house in a rundown part of town for 45k. Then we buy 2 more nearby at that cost with other LLC's that have a different set of ""investors"". Then we form a fourth LLC to collectively buy a fourth house nearby, but for $120k even though it was previously the least valuable one at 40k. That now resets the real estate comp market value for the area. If the worst house is now ""worth"" $150k then the first 3 that are better have to be ""worth"" at least that. So now I have over 100k in equity the first 3 houses I bought that I can then take out home equity loans against and use that money to fix the houses up. If I start with one that is now valued at $150k (compared to the worst one now valued at $120k), and renovate it really nicely it jumps up to 200k. Then each one goes higher as they improve and the surrounding houses are also nicer (nicer neighborhood) so they are ""worth"" over 200k when I sell them. I have sold them all and made 100k on each if I limit my renovations to 50k each. So now I've got 300k in Capitol gains in the first 3 houses and use 150k to demo the first junky house and build a new one. That house, being new in what is now considered a nicer neighborhood, is easily ""worth"" 275k now because it's the best of the 4 houses. So I made another 125k on that one. Added to the first 150k leftover from the first 3 sales I have 275k in capital gains. But the tax code let's me delay paying taxes against that as long as I invest it in more real estate. So I do it again on a larger scale now. As my holdings grow my wealth grows. But I never take it as income so I don't ever pay taxes on it. But I can take loans against the value of it to buy other things. That's also not income and I can pay it back by using the LLC to pay me just enough to pay back the loan. And the LLC can pay for my car, housing, meals, vacations(company meetings), cell phone, etc. And that's not income either. It's a job perk for working for the LLC.. That's why Trump lives at Mar A Lago but doesn't pay tax on it. That's why his family all ""work"" for the Trump Org. And that's why they can have so much without paying taxes. Thanks to our broken tax code it's legal, though immoral. And the kicker is that everyone else is paying for it through artificially inflated housing costs that we call ""gentrification"". All made possible because a crooked bank is all too happy to loan an ""investor"" a ridiculous amount on that fourth house to start the process of artificially over valuing all of the other houses. It benefits the banks because they own most of the houses through mortgage loans so they inflate their own holdings as well. And if somebody can't afford their taxes and get foreclosed it's a massive win for the bank ""investors"", who now own a home worth far more than it cost to build and can't make more money on the resale. So the banks actually LIKE their bad loans. That is because, under George Bush, we removed the wall that used to be between loan banking and investment banking. Now banks make money when you pay ridiculous loan prices but they make even more money when you can no longer afford to pay your mortgage. And then we have a ""housing crisis' that leads taxpayers to pass laws to spend billions per city on ""affordable housing"" that isn't really that affordable and you have to have income low enough to qualify for.  Things like this is why America is broken. Boomers created loopholes that screwed subsequent generations because they wanted more more more. There are so many things that are legal, but shouldn't be. We need to restore the loophole between investment banking and loan banking. We need to close the loophole for LLC's that allow delayed payment of tax on Capitol gains. Taxing the hundreds of trillions of dollars as capital gains (which it is) would pay for universal healthcare, free college tuition, Medicare, Medicaid, higher teacher salaries, higher salaries for enlisted military, fully restored roads and highways, Green energy conversion, etc. And it would stop the skyrocketing housing costs as well.  Unfortunately we only elect politicians who already made millions in these types of ""investments""  so they'll never vote to change it, or even that time teaching Americans how to replicate it. Because that would make housing even more expensive and make you their competitors in the real estate market.

"This is the most delusional things I’ve ever read. Trump called on Putin to go ahead and release hacked government files before he was even in office. Once there, he was impeached for trying to shake Ukraine down for weapons. Why was he doing this? Who benefits from Ukraine not having access to American weapons? From there the FBI and CIA were directed to not investigate Russian hacks and disinformation campaigns, and to focus on antifa instead. HE GAVE PUTIN A US MILITARY BASE while abandoning the Kurds in Syria. He leaked so much Israeli intelligence to Putin that a record number of our spies were killed. There’s never been a US president that groveled and played lapdog to a dictator the way Trump does. There’s not even a second place he’s so far ahead in kissing Putin’s ass like it’s a contest.",fractalfay,2025-03-16T16:36:42,1
"Finally a post that addressed the question from OP from Italy.  Are we in US in favor with reconciliation with Russia?  Trump is making peace with Russia because he knows we need an alliance if we go against China.  In my opinion, many people do not trust this.  Some people remember when Russia was our arch enemy and fear Communism or getting attacked.  Older people remember when Russia was our ally in WW2.  Many are skeptical about back room deals and personal profit from the relationship.  As you can see from these posts, many people just hate Trump so much they’re taking it personally and anything he does is a tragedy.  To put it into perspective, if Putin put a military base in Toronto after he agreed he wouldn’t, what would we do?  Thank Canada?  Now about pulling away from Europe.  It’s about money.  Since Trump’s inauguration he has been auditing the crap out of our too fat Government.  Trump’s got Musk, the richest, smartest (but weird) man in the world and his young thirsty crew digging up wasteful spending.  It’s like opening a crypt.  Parts of our government have not been updated technologically for decades.  This is the fault of mismanagement of all past leaders of both parties.  The bad part is that there’s so much bloat Trump’s chopping the trees down when he could be pruning.  It’s a lot of aggressive moves in a short period of time.  That is scary.   The reality is that we are in debt and our taxpayers are paying for it.  We are giving money and weapons away freely to other countries for strategic means because we are considered the world’s police and generous daddy.  From a financial standpoint, the US should be fiscally responsible to our people not paying for wars elsewhere.  We can’t afford to save the world when we are not focusing on the people that pay for it.  Both Republicans and Democrats see rising grocery prices, homelessness, poverty, substance dependence and mental illness, a confusing and crooked healthcare system and our ineffective education system.  Our government pays billions to private universities where half the students aren’t even Americans.  The lower and middle class can’t afford the tuition for these private universities.   Our individual state universities were meant to advance the residents of each state but instead are overrun with foreigners.  It’s a rigged game when the state university tuition is so high only the Chinese can afford it or even worse our American students can’t compete with the test scores.  Then we have millions of trespassers pouring in illegally from all over the world taking resources from our people.  Ask any grade school teacher in a sanctuary city how resources are delegated.  Too many socialist bleeding hearts wanting to save humanity but wanting everyone to pay for it.  I digress, but it all goes back to money.     We had a President who got dementia.  He lost control of his power.  His party was not loyal and are mostly old crooked players.  His party did not hold a primary and disenfranchised voters by pushing an ill equipped candidate.  Poor Biden had his back stabbed by his own party.  Then we had Trump with all his theatrics and convincing appeal.  Trump won.  Well he’s calling the shots now and this is going to send some people to the moon but he chose a loyal crackerjack team that will be effective.",Tricky-Consequence47,2025-03-16T11:05:52,-1

"Reversing that terrible nonlethal aid policy did great harm to Russia.  They were betting on 3 years of stockpiling and training wouldn’t be enough and they lost that bet hard.  In 2014 Ukraine was helpless against Russia’s tanks, but this time when they rushed in they were shredded with US javelins.  If Trump just decided to let the previous policy stand, or if Hillary was elected, then Ukraine would have fallen in a few days.  There would have been no time to assist them in an active war zone, and an embolden Russia would have likely invaded another sovereign nation by now.  That alone was a massive setback to Putin’s ambitions to rebuild their old empire.    For Zelensky I think his ambassador’s reaction says it all.  It wasn’t shock at Trump but horror and embarrassment over Zelensky going off the rails in an Oval Office presser.  He became antagonistic and of course Trump wasn’t going to let that slide.  The peace process could have been well underway today if it wasn’t for that stunt.  Yes, Trump is being harsh on him but he has to be to bring Russia to the table.  Russia isn’t going to negotiate if two of the three parties are fully against them.  If this negotiation fails I don’t see any other chance for Ukraine to survive.  Russia will keep chipping away and kill them slowly.  If we can end this war we can resume arming Ukraine and have assets there worth protecting to deter further aggression.",Fargason,2025-03-16T16:50:55,1
