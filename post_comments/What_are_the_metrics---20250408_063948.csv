"How about homes and healthcare afforded by average earners?  Pretty simple.  Has he improved that or destroyed it for the foreseeable future?  No matter what metric you use, his supporters absolutely won't care whether he excels or sucks at it.",HardlyDecent,2025-04-10T05:37:15,5
"There is no metric, and that is by design.  The Republican Party as a whole ceded such specific and measurable goals when they granted such powers to the Executive Branch in Trump. In the absence of such goals, there is no foundation to hold Trump accountable to. The court of public opinion and social media presence fueling negative partisanship is the glue that holds everything together- not metrics.  Reminder that this has been the case and further developing since 2016. While it sounds negatively connotated on its face, the trade off is the securement of Republican power in each branch of government via a motivated voting base.",txswampdonks,2025-04-10T10:08:17,6
Does he piss off the left? Is the left in a panic? Are liberals fleeing? Is he 'pulling one over on the left'? Is he purging the government of liberals?  This is how MAGA knows Trump is doing a good job. Any pain or rough patches are just the road to winning against the left.  Trump has to own the libs.,ShotnTheDark_TN,2025-04-11T14:15:08,2

"It really doesn't matter how they ""should"" gauge his performance.¬† ""Should"" is a normative term, referencing some set of expectations or rules.¬†¬† But can you cite any formal source of those expectations or rules? I doubt it.¬†   So the only relevant question is not how they ""should"" gauge it but how they _do_ gauge it.¬†¬† It appears that they do it by vibe, ie how it makes them feel.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-11T17:32:14,1
"[Presidential Rankings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_rankings_of_presidents_of_the_United_States) via survey of historians, scholars , and other ‚Äúspecialists‚Äù across a broad range of leadership parameters have been done, but these all appear subjective and not based on defensible, consensus metrics. My sense is that even if you could get enough ppl to agree on some basic metrics, they would probably need to be revised periodically to ensure those metrics align with whatever are the nation‚Äôs top priorities, which is hilarious just to type it out.  But it would be an interesting experiment.    And then there‚Äôs a saying one of my old VPs had:  ‚ÄúFigures lie and liars figure.‚Äù ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",sunberrygeri,2025-04-12T13:43:50,1

"I appreciate your sentiment but, we might have to be creative about what we measure.  Kind of like comedians use ""laugh meters"" etc. maybe, in this case there needs to be a meter for outrage or arousal.  The point of your response is dead on.

I mean this sub is for serious discussion but how owned the libs are is obviously important. Second only to maybe how much suffering brown people face.,Sorge74,2025-04-10T07:46:30,7
"""Should"" has a variety of meanings. Please don't fixate on one.  What I'm looking for is what that one - possibly non-existent - honest Trump voter felt Trump would deliver, and a clear way Trump's success (or failure) could be measured. We've had some - child poverty levels, wealth gap etc - (although, no clear sources for the precise metric to be used and dates those metrics should be recorded).   When you say they vote based on how they feel, you make them sound like drug addicts! If a majority of voters are voting like drug addicts, how does America solve that problem? What's the voter equivalent of sectioning someone and putting them through rehab?",xwsrx,2025-04-11T22:58:13,1
"It‚Äôs hard to engage if you‚Äôre die hard maga, cause you have to do so much more research for any rebuttals.

"What I mean when I said they vote according to their feelings is that they vote based on their emotional reaction to what the candidate and his party present to them and the signals they are getting from their community and people around them.¬†   Our system of popular democracy has its roots in the Enlightenment which as you probably know is also called the ""age of reason"" because it made such a fetish out of rationality.¬†¬† The basic presumption was a human beings were fundamentally rational and would make their decisions as rational utility maximizers.¬†¬†   This way of thinking affected the development of economics, politics, social theory, and science. Only in science though did it seem to provide the impetus for dramatic advances and improvements.¬†¬† In the other fields it turned out to be just wishful thinking.¬†   How does America solve its problem?¬†¬† Perhaps it doesn't. By far, the most dominant form of government since the rise of advanced civilizations has been authoritarian autocracy.¬†¬† Other systems have been tried from time to time but were never very stable and never lasted long.¬†¬† America was the first of the modern popular democracies attempted by a major country. And that was only a little over 200 years ago... A blink of an eye in historical terms. My best guess is that the west will revert to the mean in every sense of that word.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-12T15:43:45,1
"I mean... That's just untrue.  ""Die hard MAGA"" just starts us off on the wrong foot, because if you're starting from a premise that there's nothing that can change your mind, you're saying you're incapable of reasoned debate.  I'm just after a metric, a date when we record that metric, and what ""score"" on that metric will constitute success.  There's no trick there, unless you consider asking for accountability as a trick.",xwsrx,2025-04-09T15:15:43,8
"Defining metrics are hard, cause depending on what results u want to see your outcome parameters will be different. I guess some objective measurements would be economy,childhood poverty rates, comparing how the poor are doing compared to the rich, how‚Äôs the middle class. It would be nice to have clear cut metrics but politics is a humanities subject so any metric won‚Äôt give a clear answer. I think holistic critical review would be best with historical analysis and maybe interpolation for economic outlook. Issue with that is people don‚Äôt like reading long essays or 50 pg analysis",Intelligent-Sound-85,2025-04-09T15:35:14,3

"Thanks. Childhood poverty and wealth gap sound like decent metrics.  It seems to me though, that people say Im going to vote for X, because X will improve the economy""and then 5 years later they insist, ""I didn't mean *that* economic metric!""  It looks like the American Community Survey monitors childhood poverty, so is that the metric you're suggesting? And a comparison of the figure on Day 1 with the figure on his last day in office?",xwsrx,2025-04-09T15:41:38,3
"Yeah, that's what I understood by the term.  It's nonsense that they're held to greater evidential standard.  Anyway, did you vote for him? Whether you did or not, what would your metric be?",xwsrx,2025-04-09T15:34:51,2
Yeah that works I guess. To reiterate this stuff is complex and quantifying human behavior(which is what politics is) is very hard.,Intelligent-Sound-85,2025-04-09T15:53:32,1
