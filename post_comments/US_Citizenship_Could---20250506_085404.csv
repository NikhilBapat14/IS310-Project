Why come and go through the citizenship process when you can be whisked away at a moment’s notice after paying potentially tens of thousands and having spent decades here?,BigDaddyBain,2025-05-06T08:57:49,53

"America, in its founding lore, was a place to go when your home was no longer tolerant of your way of life. Growing up in America we were taught that the pilgrims came here to feel religious persecution. That we threw England out for the promise of a Democratic Republic. That we fought and won civil war to free the slaves and preserve the Union. We got involved in two World Wars to usher in the end of Imperialism and save Europe from tyranny. And all along the way we welcomed in the tired, the hungry, and the huddled masses. America was the Land of Opportunity. All men created equal.  It was, of course, far more nuanced than that. But that was our LORE. Our identity. What we strived to be. And even went we faltered and failed, we looked to that ideal, that promise and as a nation tried to be more than what we really are.   We have been on this dark road before. There is a way out. But we need to remember that the Idea of America, and who she really is, are two different entities all together. This blight of xenophobia and hate has ALWAYS been in America. We just never projected it so loudly and boldly before.   We cannot let this hate stand without a fight.",YupChrisYup,2025-05-06T09:07:29,30

"Oh, absolutely, it will be dramatically different. If you pay $5M, you’re officially a Trump-Class Citizen. Pay $2.5M, and you’re on probation, just make sure to tweet ""Long Live the King"" every day for the next two years. If you fork over $1M, citizenship is still possible, but you'll be stuck as a resident of the 51st state: Canada. Drop $500K, and your new home will be the 52nd state: Greenland. Otherwise, it’s 20 years working at Mar-a-Lago for you!",DuplicatedMind,2025-05-06T10:42:27,3

For another year or two until republicans lose the midterms and then it will all change back in 2028 when democrats win the presidency. This is the issue with democracy and the reliance on executive orders. Literally everything Trump has done is an EO and can just be undone day 1 by a different president. These articles about how America is now are just click bait. This isn’t legislation codified into law it’s a temporary blip on the radar. ,DirtyProjector,2025-05-06T10:53:55,0
I'm not sure if you mean people whose bloodline originates in India or native Americans.   I also don't think matters to them,cudntfigureaname,2025-05-06T09:39:38,13
"> America, in its founding lore, was a place to go when your home was no longer tolerant of your way of life.   You're thinking of the Pilgrims. They came here because of their Puritan belief in religion.  The folks in the South at Jamestown? They came here to make money from tobacco and whatever else they could make that would be valuable in Europe. Those two colonies growing and coming into conflict is what the Civil War was about.  And now the money guys are running things...",superanth,2025-05-06T09:12:31,14

The Puritans settled in Holland first but the Dutch informed them that their whole “burning heretics at the stake” thing wasn’t really working out there. They were encouraged to go to the new world. The Dutch even bought them the ships and pointed the way.,MZsarko,2025-05-06T11:50:00,4
Indeed. My understanding is that many in Europe were quite happy to see them go somewhere else.,GlitchyMcGlitchFace,2025-05-06T10:48:52,5
">The Puritan pilgrims came to settle the US coz they found Europe to be too liberal for their particular brand of strict, less-tolerant Christianity.
