"In my view, cutting 1,200 jobs from the CIA isn't just some random belt-tightening. This is part of a pattern with Trump that's been going on for decades and looks more and more like he’s acting in the interests of Russia, not the U.S.  People forget that Trump’s connections to Russia go way back—to the late '80s when the Soviets first started trying to cultivate him, e.g., his assigned code name: Krasnov. Since then, he’s had shady business ties with Russian oligarchs, tons of cash from questionable sources - many connected to the Russian mob -  and he’s parroted Kremlin talking points for decades (like bashing NATO and supporting Putin publicly).  Now in his second term, Trump’s pushing to gut U.S. intelligence agencies, especially the CIA. That’s not just weakening the “deep state”—it’s dismantling one of the main institutions that keeps tabs on foreign adversaries like Russia. It sure as hell looks like he’s helping Putin by kneecapping the very agencies designed to protect U.S. national security.  At some point, it stops looking like coincidence and starts looking like what it probably is: the slow-motion sabotage of America’s intel community by someone who’s been compromised for a long time. Whether you call it treason or just a decades-long con, the result is the same—Putin wins, and the U.S. loses.",haiku2572,2025-05-03T08:10:06,208

We're the most powerful military and have the sophisticated intelligence apparatus in the world, but what does it matter if who remains are inept in using them?  It's going to be funny when if year from now every weird thing gets leaked and every big nation can hack our shit and out maneuver us economically, AI, and various other ways.

"This man wants to go to war with Canada, Denmark, and Mexico. I would like to point out that wars are won through spying.  You can have the best technological and Weaponized advantages in the world. Hell, you could even have the best and highly motivated assault group known to Mann, but they will still fail if they don’t know what they’re up against. Just because we have the best space program for warfare ever known to mankind does not mean that we will win our next engagement.   Remember, this is the same dumbass that surrendered to a terrorist organization that literally in turn, took over an entire country. Every failure of his administration rests at the feet of him, not being intelligent enough to recognize that America’s prominence on the world stage was mostly due to the CIA, the FBI, and in a larger part, the department of homeland security.  We would not have known what to do unless we had people in the appropriate positions around the world so we could counter what’s coming because we saw it before they could enact it.   We are about to see terrorism in the United States on a level that the world will gawk at. There will be craters in the cities and towns across this country. And it won’t even be from bombs that have been dropped. It will have been from bombs that were planted.  The reason why we’ve enjoyed next to no terrorism in this country minus a few pretty big things, was because of our spine network and how we had them embedded in places that mattered.

They have a relatively conservative culture there when compared to the State Department and USAID.

Not only is Trump significantly worse (I disagree with Dutton's policies, but at least he seems to believe in them and he respects the political process), but the only reason Trump can do so much damage is because the US political system is enabling him. It's a perfect storm - SCOTUS refused to hold him accountable, Congress has never been able to hold him accountable - the separation of powers has failed because of how deeply entrenched the US has become in partisanship.   Australia is completely different. We have a political system that doesn't shine the spotlight on a single person, but rather the party as whole. We don't directly elect our head of state, they're selected by the party, so we avoid celebrity-leader situations in which someone with zero political experience but a lot of money and fame can become the head of state. Our courts are not split by partisanship. While we still are primarily governed by two parties, our minor parties and independents hold some power, which can still cause the major parties to compromise. We achieve that largely because we have a preferential voting system.    There are so, so, SO many aspects of the Australian political system that differ from the US in a way that prevent a Trump-like situation.

Five Eyes became stingy with their secrets and strategies with the US once Trump had that conversation on classified material in the white house with the Russians back in 2017.  Now it is a full on cold shoulder after Trump's annexation talk towards Canada.,ChrisFromIT,2025-05-03T22:50:38,2
"I think you’re right, but that takes time. Trade deals and supply chains move slowly in the global economy. The 2020 recession is a good example of that—much of that was simply global supply chains trying to adjust to a new reality of lockdowns. And of course those changes were really uneven and unpredictable, favoring certain sectors in certain areas, often arbitrarily. The economic result was a good deal of chaos for everyone—slowdowns, empty shelves, inflation, unemployment, declining capital flows and wealth transfers, etc.   And that was mostly just the global economy *adjusting* to a new reality. Adjusting to this reality will also take time and there will be knock-on effects we’ll have to deal with. (In any case, get ready for more extremism—that seems to be a fairly consistent side effect of global economic chaos.)",Momik,2025-05-03T09:44:31,1

"I never mentioned Trump. And if it's possible to do the bad things without doing the good ones, shouldn't the opposite be true as well? If so, why does it need to be both good and bad? And I think it's with you, since it's with what you wrote that I disagreed. And critical thought is also necessary to realize when something IS morally bad.",RyuuGaSaiko,2025-05-03T17:26:58,1

"This. Every single confederate should have been hung as an example. And that ideaology crushed for good. The USA, rather than have its denazification moment, swept it under the rug where it festered and grew.",noiresaria,2025-05-03T20:15:06,5
"Like I said, there were mistakes. Mistakes that Germany  still feels today. But regarding the general population, yes, it did work. Germany went from full on fascist state to liberal modern democracy in mere years. This wasn't just the people playing along, the vast majority did denounce racism, at least in the newer generations.",coldfirephoenix,2025-05-04T01:41:30,1

"I am confused about what you are trying to argue.  The CIA accomplished both good and bad.  That is more or less a fact, although you can also deem it inherently good or bad based on your opinion.    America needs an intelligence agency up until the time when our adversaries stop having their own.  As to how you think this post can exist without acknowledging the man who is defunding the agency - really?  Do you think this is about trump's disappointment that the CIA overthrew many left wing governments in this hemisphere and beyond?  Do you think he opposes it giving info to Israel that has been used to cause death?  Or do you think that he wants corrupt autocrats from around the world to have more freedom to do what they want in contravention of international law and all established beliefs in human morality?",rogozh1n,2025-05-03T17:33:40,1
"The AFD being the largest party in Germany would indicate otherwise. I lived there for 7 years. The cities weren’t as bad, but rural Germany is pretty much like rural areas here, with massive xenophobia and racism. It didn’t go anywhere, it did go underground for a time. Much like when I lived in Alabama and the drinks started flowing and folks started dropping n-words and talking up segregation.",JadedSun78,2025-05-04T09:02:56,1
"People of a certain age grew up in the 50s and early 60s when the USA and Canada were islands separated by two oceans from the rest of the world, which was rebuilding from world war.

"The CIA accomplished good for the US and its allies alone, while screwing up a lot of other countries. And I don't think Trump is trying to prevent the bad things it had done, just that no benefit it gives justifies the bad things it did.

"The AFD is NOT the largest party in Germany. Trust me, as a German, I'm embarrassed it's as big as it is, but it has never been the largest.   And sure, I get your argument.
