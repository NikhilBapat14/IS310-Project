Anyone that actually believes that Trump is pro-legal immigration is a mindless moron and nothing more.,ZillaSlayer54,2025-04-25T10:32:05,23
">she was charged with moral turpitude  Wow...they're really going there already.

And they can't even use their standard racist excuse on her as she's Irish (yes, I know Irish were discriminated against just as much, but their standard go to is the Skin Color Chart ^TM and they can't use that here).",ERedfieldh,2025-04-25T10:35:23,21
