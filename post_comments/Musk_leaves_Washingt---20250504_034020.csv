"Overpromising is a specialty of these con men.  >'while campaigning for Trump last fall, Musk bragged that he could easily find ""at least $2 trillion"" in savings  >Does Musk know that $160 billion is just 8% of $2 trillion?  They can't even reconcile $160 billion - their own website lists $58bn.  The cost of those ""savings"" is estimated to be $135BN, ""according to the Partnership for Public Service (PSP), a nonpartisan nonprofit that focuses on the federal workforce"" if you include 'putting tens of thousands of federal employees on paid leave, re-hiring mistakenly fired workers and lost productivity.'  So the actual DOGE SAVINGS is somewhere between  -$77BN and +$25BN  MASSIVE FAIL!  But LEON'S Overpromising just facilitated his crimes, crony hires, and data theft.  I'm going to bet he's only superficially ""stepping down"" because WH can't hold off the lawsuits against him any longer.  (By WH standards, a CRIMINAL IMMIGRANT needs to be rendered / DEPORTED -- Zero Tolerance)  Now he begins self-dealing.  He'll be using the information and cronies culled from DOGE to grant his companies massive government contracts and concessions.  Trump already helped get this rolling with free PR (Buying Tesla on WH Lawn presser), Tesla tariff exemptions, trying to double SpaceX launches, and pushing Starlink to replace Verizon in FAA contracts (and elsewhere).  Consider any SpaceX ""ask"" of the FAA pre-approved, since Leon has gutted the agency, and brought in a bunch of pimple-faced MuskRats to ""test StarLink as a partial fix""  He's not ""leaving Washington.""  He's burrowing deeper into the pockets of American taxpayers.

"Shortly before the election a group called ""My Bright Horizon"" was going around my city seeking to ""collaborate"" with our local community outreach organizations (stuff like literacy/English language programs, food and agriculture support, libraries and social services, etc) specifically targeting legal, documented refugee communities and trying to get them to fill out ""relocation"" forms that very closely resembled and in some cases is actual deportation paperwork. The additional targeting of literacy organizations, to me, implies they were trying to target people with limited English proficiency who would be easier to trick into completing the paperwork.

The sole reason that didn't happen is because Biden and the Democratic party as a whole had the opportunity to and sat on their asses instead. Biden could have fired Garland and replaced him with someone that would have gone on the warpath against Trump and Trump would rightly be in prison right now.

Now Musk has actively destroyed the agencies that could have brought him up on charges for what he's doing.

There’s shit heads everywhere. Not unique to rural or urban areas or geographic regions. Y’all just hate southerners here but I can tell you there are racist assholes in NY or Boston too.,Mission_Bad8048,2025-05-04T21:32:05,-5
"They tend to have a limited sphere of people they are good to, and the rest of the world can burn for all they care. Which can be confusing to the people they are good to.

"Unfortunately my grandmother (90’s) is a single issue voter. Abortion. Votes R every time because they claim to be against it, even when they’re hypocrites about it.",BodaciousFrank,2025-05-04T22:10:56,1
"Like I said, Biden could have fired Garland, replace him with someone who would have gone on the warpath against Trump. Trump would be in prison right now. And that's just one method. They never did anything about the rampant gerrymandering and voter suppression. They never did anything to pin the obvious insurrection going on Trump. They didn't oppose his ""victory"" which was incredibly obviously stolen. They had decades to shore the country up against the very same nonsense that Trump is pulling and did nothing. There's a lot more. The Democrats had four years to do something and did nothing, like they always do.",immortalfrieza2,2025-05-05T11:36:12,1
"I have a conservative family member, we’ll call him Jim. Jim served the country, worked hard all his life, and was loyal to a company that worked him like a dog. He smokes, drinks and hunts. He’s an outdoorsman and rural Southerner.  His CEO boss offers him property, says he can pay it off over time. Jim loves that, and Jim pays his bills and rent over time, has a great property, loves his neighbors like family. His boss’ wife, meanwhile, helps leak the Supreme Court decision against Roe v Wade, locking in the SCOTUS vote.  Anyways, Jim saves up the money to outright buy the rest of the property. Comes to his boss, says I’ve done the numbers and I should owe you X amount, and I’ll buy the property from you. Boss says, “I’m not counting your rent toward the property, we never signed a contract for that.” Jim quits his job and gets a different property, absolutely betrayed by his boss.  Jim still loves Trump (who, like his former boss, is a narcissist real estate owner) and thinks Democrats are evil.",Patient0ZSID,2025-05-04T18:18:00,2
