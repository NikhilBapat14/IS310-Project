"There’s more context needed to my answer; but basically **No**.  Media worldwide *likes* to simplify complex matters to create polarization and thus debate (discourse and arguments) because the engagement means more eyes on that particular media.

"No. The democrats are being framed as ""extreme"" for supporting ideas like ""'equal rights for all' means ALL"" and ""a robust safety net and publc services are essential to a functioning country"". Those are not extreme view points by any metric.

"I don't think there is such a thing as ""both sides"".      The US system promotes binary thinking on politics, but at the very least there is a spectrum of beliefs.  Trump rode to victory on the back of a range of goals and resentments.  There's little doubt that his agenda is too radical for the traditional conservatives, for the Reaganite neocons, for the people who voted for law and order...  his main cheerleaders are his base, the online mouthpieces, and even they are a mixed bunch of antisemites, conspiracy theorists, gun enthusiasts, crypto-bros.  On the American left (which is, for the most part, not very left) you have everything from ANCOMs who want a stateless society to tax and spend internationalists.  Do you think Hilary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi are political extremists?  Trump is still a reaction to the political status quo.  People see distant lords in their Washington castles getting rich while spending their tax dollars on international vanity projects, often while neglecting the jurisdictions they were elected to represent.  Trump suggests he's going to stop all that, and people take notice   Of course, he isn't going to stop all that.  He's going to spend on other vanity projects, while tanking the economy and dismantling the infrastructure people rely on.  But the Democrat party's reaction to 2016 sealed their fate, I think.  Instead of seeking out younger talent, or local politicians, and pursuing more of a populist, democratic agenda, they circled the wagons to protect the Washington establishment.  Now, Trump's mad-king act is putting voters off, and I expect the mid-terms to be something of a reckoning, but I would hope that the party insiders have learned to listen to the electorate now.",EnglishTony,2025-04-03T04:20:30,2
"The news media doesn't use the term ""wedge issues"" enough. Politicians and political pundits focus on wedge issues specifically to create political divides because that division is good for their business but not for governance or the public good.  When Republicans realized in the late 60s that their economic and tax policies weren't popular with the general public they began focusing on ""social conservativism"". Get people who don't like abortion, homosexuals, feminism, etc to pick you side and support regressive tax policies at the same time. Wedge issues.

"You can always find plenty of extremists on both sides of the political spectrum, but that doesn’t automatically mean they are in charge. Right now, the American Right seems fully dominated by its extremist wing, while the American Left is not (or at least not on the same level as the American Right).  On the other hand, social media often seems dominated by the extremists from both sides, which makes left-wing extremists look more important and influential than they really are.",NekoCatSidhe,2025-04-03T03:11:03,1
"Sort of.  Christian nationalists and right-wing populists are large enough voting blocs that they can dominate the Republican party.  Progressive populists comprise a small bloc of voters, yet progressive politicians and staffers have disproportionate power within the Democratic party because the establishment wing attempts to appease them.   In both instances, the populists are the heart of the problem and it is impossible to work with them.  Establishment conservatives will need to leave the party and vote against the GOP if they are to have any hope of controlling the rabble.    On the other hand, the Democrats have the numbers to dominate the progressives but they lack the will to do it.

One of these things is not like the other. How can any reasonable person be anything but strongly pro Ukraine and anti Russian? One is a despicable autocracy that brutalizes its own and invades to rape and murder its neighbor.  Let's pick on another topic that actually has two sides. Most people have a nuanced perspective on abortion and most folks believe we should have abortions depending on circumstances.  The right has to lie about the lefts position to pretend it has an extreme opponent because its own actually extreme positions are so unpopular.   There you have it folks the right is extremely for imperialism genocide and dead moms and the left is extremely for protecting people getting murdered.,Michaelmrose,2025-04-07T00:45:54,1
"Imagine a world where rich people don't domineer over the rest of us with their proclamations on news channels they own, without a government of bureaucrats controlled by the financiers and oligarchs. Imagine a world where workers have absolute authority to decide what gets done, and they decide democratically how to go about things, with representatives who make the median workers wage, where decisions of the economy are assisted by computers to maximise the welfare of all people.   Perhaps this is radical, perhaps this is extreme. But are you going to say that this world is just as bad as the world tue Nazis showed us in the 1940's. You might say... What about the world the Soviets have shown us? Yes, a world where housing is a universal guarantee, along with healthcare. One may point to their problems and you would be right for doing so.   But what do we have today which is different from the Soviets and their highly undeveloped fuedal economy? How does our culture differ from that of backwards peasant Russia or China?   The world is very extremely capitalist, so much so that to imagine an alternative system is viewed as nigh impossible. Have you not considered you have been raised into believing that the possible is impossible? How is it materially impossible? It's not materially impossible we have the technology to resolve the central economic question, to believe that only capitalists can accomplish this feat, then you believe in an absurdity, that capitalist oligarchs and the market are smarter than supercomputers. Then the question is... Isn't it against human nature?   WHAT IS human nature? You tell me, but I can tell you that ugg and grug didn't trade stocks or worry about market valuations, ugg and grug knew naught of such things, they knew only of bow and spear. To use a less caricature version of the stone age, lets think of Aboriginals of Australia, they had no conception of private property, they had no conception of money. Are you going to tell them that their human nature was wrong? That them living in harmony with the Earth is not human nature?   Well one might say communism works only on a small scale. But how did this work? Is it because they were nomadic? Perhaps, but I love quantifiable details.   Social Democrats in America don't have the guts to admit that their political program is influenced by us, in fact social democrats want to edge society towards socialism, step by step. But we communists are honest, we don't want merely concessions... We want it all, we do, and we will take it from the capitalists. We don't wish to beg for our place in the world, we wish to take it!   One could posit that such actions are extreme, but what about inaction to an ecological catastrophe? Is that mot extreme? Is it not extreme to throw the poor countries of the world under the bus so that you can have a decent standard of living?   If anything, liberals are extreme cowards who desire not political cohesion or consistently, but wish to pick and choose which marginalised group we include this season. The conservatives are no less dishonest, but at least their mostly consistent, that they like the status quo, and they don't want nothin to really change. Or wait... Conservatives don't believe that, they like slow change rather than anything radical, honestly it seems like both the liberals and conservatives are the same thing, just opposite wings of the liberal monstrosity.

"The terms left and right, liberal and conservative, are failing us in our political dialog. Because although the MAGA movement is largely far-right, it's not a conservative movement, not in any traditional sense.   MAGA really isn't a political ideology, as it is largely the product of one man's rhetoric and dependent on that one man's whims for what positions they take. MAGA is a grievance culture. Mostly white grievance, but all kinds of grievance are welcome. This is why the Evangelicals are so besotted with it, those folks think they're being discriminated against whenever they're not allowed to force the rest of us to live by their religious dictates.

"People always say stuff like this, but I never hear concrete reasons why being large means that the US can’t have social welfare, progressive taxation etc. We haven’t tried so we can’t say it’s failed!   I also think most Americans are incredibly ignorant of the rest of the world and the knee-jerk reaction that something couldn’t happen in the US is born out of willful dismissal, not actual research. Yes, Denmark is small, but it’s not “off the grid” at all — it’s in the heart of a densely populated continent and part of a large coalition of states in the EU. Danish citizens regularly work and live in other countries and vice versa.   There are other examples of countries that are large which work better with social welfare, too. France and Germany, while not quite as large, have significant territorial mass and large populations. Japan has a huge population and a much more difficult geography than the US. Canada has a much higher ratio of area to population than the US and has the challenge of dealing with multiple official languages as well!

Yet these countries manage to have effective social welfare systems and safety nets despite having diverse populations and arguably more internal conflict than in the US.   The other thing is that I don’t understand the logic of the argument.

That's why we should focus on general approval ratings and economic breakdowns rather than individual stories.  >Why dont you and Denmark-lovers move to Denmark if its the cats-ass?  That is a fair question, I agree. I actually wanted to move to a European country when I was younger but decided not to because I didn't want to leave family behind. Same reason people in West Virginia don't leave.",AnonymousBi,2025-04-05T10:56:49,1
"So Castro, Chavez, and Mugabe are all dead and aren’t examples of current anything. Kim Jong Un is alive and for sure a dictator, though the only politician I’ve ever heard praise him was Donald Trump. But that is one. Maduro would be another for sure. I’d hardly consider them equivalent to the scale of horrors being inflicted by the right and pretending they’re the same is still dumb as fuck. The actions of Xi and Trump alone affect so many more people than the only two valid examples you came up with.   Do you think it’s a good sign you had to use so many examples of dead people?",BbCortazan,2025-04-03T03:30:56,8
