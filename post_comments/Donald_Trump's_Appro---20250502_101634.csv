"Person living in rural Ohio here. I still have yet to meet a single Trump supporter who has turned on him. I work over the WV border, and part of my job is to interact with well over 1,000 employees all the time. He easily had a 90% approval rating among the employees in November. Not a single one has changed their (mostly his) mind.     My neighbors all think he's doing an amazing job. I was talking to one after work yesterday, and he told me that Trump is the best president since Reagan. He might even be the best president ever. I asked him why, and he said (and yes, this is a direct quote) ""He cleaned up this country! We're doin' better than we ever been!"" I asked him for specifics, and he had none. I asked him about grocery prices, jobs, anything I could think of. His response? ""President don't control that!""     Yes, he blamed Biden for egg prices. Yes, he blamed Biden for gas prices. If he stubbed his toe, it was Joe. I don't think people on Reddit or in big cities understand how simpleminded these people are. Good things = Trump. Bad things = Liberals. It's that simple. Every bad thing that happens, even if Trump is *directly* responsible, is the fault of the liberals. The sun rises due to Trump, and bad weather is because liberals.     His casino went bankrupt due to liberals, of course. He's a great businessman! His myriad failed businesses are all due to liberals sabotaging him.

"Most rural Americans have had no idea how much they needed the Federal interventions that made lives bearable.  Almost every small town in flyover country has had population losses over the last few decades, some extremely dramatic. This results in excessive vacancies in properties for sale, with unsellable homes going into abandonment and overgrown, then sometimes mysterious fires.  With that population loss comes closing of shops in the town center (of course Walmart has had something to do with that too), but small town centers generally look like hell in many places. Go for a drive and see for yourself.  I am not talking about the decaying big cities, although the situation is very much the same, I am talking about tiny little towns in Arkansas, Alabama, Nebraska ... all over.  Schools close and kids are bussed to far away consolidated schools. The old abandoned schools look just as bad as the abandoned factories.  With the dropping population also comes a drop in available medical services, and local hospitals are on the very edge (if not already closed).  People see all this and think ""the economy sucks"" and they are angry, but it's not that at all. Automation dropped jobs out of the factories, mines and farms and that is mostly what caused people to leave town. Still, the people are angry, and somehow will want to believe it's all ""the libs"" or ""the Dems"" fault. It's none of that, it's that their town is in the middle of nowhere and private enterprise doesn't give a damn about them.  NO amount of a galloping economy is going to bring those towns back, in a free market economy the investors will put their development wherever the hell they want. Very unlikely to be that crappy little town in flyover country.  Change is inevitable. Government policies can make the situation a bit better for most people, or *a bit worse.* The pendulum has swung and these rural Americans are about to experience the latter. They can and should blame themselves for that.",Hesychios,2025-05-02T12:08:46,83

Well given how fragile our recovery was during Biden's 4 years; Trump taking a sledgehammer in his 2nd term will finally showcase the truth: he was unfit to handle a global economy. He tricked his voters under the guise of ""us versus them"" and the voters lapped it up like thirsty sycophants. Now they, the voters, and the administration will have to *own* this economy.

"I understand articles like this happen pretty steadily and that we're all waiting for there to be an actual shift or consequences for what happening, but it's a little annoying that anytime anything remotely positive is reported it's a constant stream of nihilistic ""so what"".   Popularity is like what fascist regimes live and die by. Trump's sole asset is his popularity. He's not making big-brain moves himself, and fooling swaths of people with caocao level tactics. If he loses his popularity, he loses his power, declining popularity is important. Also, not everyone who voted from trump is a diehard MAGA. The vocal minority didn't put him in office, it was silent majority that sided with him for one reason or another did. They don't even need to vote democrat for trump to lose ground, they just need to support his actions less and supporting him be seen as a poor decision by those with money and influence. Diehard MAGAs will support him long after he's gone probably, but there are plenty of centrists, or just people not particularly invested in politics that have started to flip on him once they are affected by his deportation policies or the tariffs or the harm to businesses and rural life he's causing.  Tesla crashed and burned \*globally\* because of what Trump and musk did. Yes, I would like to see a stronger resistance and more consequences for everything going on, but it's also been only 100 days, after 2 years of building support through campaigning.

The global military carbon footprint is the fourth highest, ranking behind the US, China and India. If the US military alone were counted as a separate country, it would be among the biggest polluters of our planet.  Some military emissions are not necessarily specific to wartime, but they increase significantly during combat. Among the largest sources are jet fuel for planes and diesel for tanks and naval ships. Other sources are the production of weapons and ammunition, or the deployment of troops. And of course the havoc wreaked by bombing, including fires and smoke. There is also a huge increase in demolition material and rubble from the wreckage of buildings during conflicts. Destroyed buildings represent a huge amount of difficult-to-recycle construction waste.

"My whole family originated from west central Minnesota. All are farmers. They are unrecognizable from when I was young. It was a big part of my youth and now it’s depressing to see them, or visit the area.   The communities are all dried up. Young people move away and those who stay are embracing MAGA and the racism and the us vs. them mentality. Or, they are uneducated drug addicts with broken families and dysfunctional lives.   The big farmers that were able to make it, were primarily successful because the democrats looked out for them.  Now they have money and are being supported by large agricultural companies and have a new mindset. It’s weird, they send their kids off to college to have them not return.  It would be professional suicide to move back to these agricultural deserts as a college graduate.   Sadly it is a self fulfilling prophecy. The less they have the more they blame “folks from the twin cities” as the problem.   They beg for industry to move in and create jobs, but hate any of the businesses that move in because it brings in too many minorities who are getting paid little to nothing, not realizing the poor education and lack of a population makes them less appealing to innovative companies of the future.   Health care has disappeared. The elderly have no access to retirement homes and their families have all moved away.   They have bought into the hate being peddled and have gone so far down the path that they don’t know what to do, or are too stubborn to admit they are wrong in trusting what got them here. A huge part of this is because of the racism they have subscribed to.   I could go on, but I won’t. Lac Qui Parle county is a microcosm of what is happening in rural America.  It is going to require a seismic shift for things to change.

"I live in a rural area and like many it is a Republican vote every time.  They will bitch, whine, and complain about the things Republican do and yet vote Republican because of talking points.  For example, when I was young they voted Bush because of certain talking points like guns, taxes, and the like.  Well, Bush cuts taxes and it does not help them and things got bad.  They talk about Bush like he is pure evil.  Talk about how bad he was.    Trump is getting some of that treatment.  He cannot run again and would lose if things get as bad as it looks.  You have some local businesses telling people in the community about how bad it is going to get.  So there is that.  Prices coming down, even if way down, will not help if it cost so many jobs.  And they have family who are no longer working.  And some businesses say it might just cost jobs.  Think is, they will still vote Republican.  Republicans cut taxes on the wealthy and they lay off like they did under Bush.  Record profits and all.  These people talk down about the system.  About the government only helping the rich.  Yet vote in the exact people that do that.  All because some woman might get an abortion, some poor person might get assistance, and lgbtq+ people might get the same rights.  You know being the sinners these people are and all.       The thing is, Trump is likely to do enough damage it takes a while to recover.  Mid-term and 2028 Democrats will take the blame.

">We need the electoral college because city folks don't understand the needs of farmers    This makes me want to beat my head against the wall.   Farmers don't understand the needs of city folks, but we don't magically get 3x the voting power because of it.   There's also the fact that the Apportionment Acts froze the House of Reps and therefore the electoral college at an early 20th century number, specifically to AVOID a constitutional crisis where some states were overrepresented.   The modern day electoral college has no resemblance at all to what the Founders intended. The INTENT was one elector per 40,000 people. George Washington thought that that was stretching individual representation too thin, and wanted it capped at 30,000. THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL VETO IN US HISTORY WAS WHEN WASHINGTON KILLED AN ATTEMPT TO GO OVER 30,000.   One electoral vote in California represents **over 700,000 people**.

"> There's also the fact that the Apportionment Acts froze the House of Reps and therefore the electoral college at an early 20th century number, specifically to AVOID a constitutional crisis where some states were overrepresented.  The crisis it was intended to avoid was that the republicans representing rural voters refused to do the constitutionally mandated census and reapportionment because they would have lost power due to the population migrating to more populous urban areas.   And to further support what you were saying about them wanting district sizes limited, the first of the articles that went out which later because the Bill of Rights was an apportionment amendment that was intended to cap districts sizes at somewhere between 50K and 60K. It came within a whisper of passing. If it had, we would live in a very different country today.   Right now, single congressional districts are far larger than the even the largest states were at the founding. And the founders saw fit to give them each two Senators and a Representative for every 30K people. In a sane world, we would go back to that model and create equally sized voting districts that ignored state lines. Each one would encompass around a million people and have two Senators and 20 Representatives.  >""...so small a number of representatives will be an unsafe depositary of the public interests; secondly, that they will not possess a proper knowledge of the local circumstances of their numerous constituents; thirdly, that **they will be taken from that class of citizens which will sympathize least with the feelings of the mass of the people, and be most likely to aim at a permanent elevation of the few on the depression of the many**;"" -- Federalist 55",loondawg,2025-05-02T20:04:22,6

"""Exporting manufacturing was only part of the class war."" Yes, indeed.  I am old enough to remember businesses leaving the big cities (my reference point is Chicago) and going to small towns downstate and in other states. They got property tax breaks for like twenty year stretches and were able to pay lower wages and benefits away from the unions. The big city operations were not (generally speaking) losing money, the owners just wanted to make MORE money. So they were comfortable wrecking people's lives to do it.  The people in those small towns were ecstatic then, they weren't complaining about those companies at the time, and they didn't give a damn about the workers in those factories and warehouses who were losing their jobs and even homes (and even sometimes families fell apart under the financial strains). I lived through all of that myself, I felt it deeply.  Now thirty years later many of those companies have moved on to Asia and Central America. NOW they are upset? NOW those companies are no good?  The leopard never changes it's spots, the companies were not good corporate citizens when they danced their way into town and they haven't changed one bit. They have no sense of loyalty to anyone.  The people though, should not be surprised at what happened.  You make a good point about the H1B visas, I hadn't thought much about it but that is exactly the same kind of move from the same kind of players with the same motivation. From my point of view, a business that has to exploit people to make a profit is already not a going concern, and a business that does not have to exploit people but does so anyway out of greed is just evil.   It's astonishing to me that the people who are hurt so badly by all of these shenanigans turn right to the kinds of people who have been perpetuating all these tragedies (people like Trump and Musk and Lutnick) and expect them to heroically defend and protect them.  They think ""a good businessman"" is the answer to all their problems! ""Trump will save us!"" some will say, many are also huge fans of Musk. Very cultish.

BEFORE Trump cut the education department, schools were insufficient.   It doesn't excuse the deliberate way they choose eat up propaganda and not check their sources, nor does it excuse bigotry. But I can see why they don't see that stark line of difference and can assign blame to democrats so easily, because NO ONE has stepped up like they should. We often snark at people being poorly educated as a factor here, but it's true and an issue we need to take as seriously as people being undernourished.

In an ideal world that would be the ""conservative"" party. The one that seeks not to offend but to find the least offensive way to govern. Status quo, business as usual.

"I’m GenX and grew up in an Appalachian coal mining area. When I was a kid all or nearly all the coal mining counties were solidly democratic bastions, with strong UMWA ties. Now they are Ruby Red MAGA. By the 1980s some counties had either been losing population for decades already as the mines mechanized, or were flat for population growth. Even though coal miner numbers decreased, production really didn’t drop until the early 2000s when fracking and cheap natural gas started killing the industry.  Now those same areas barely have any miners, many of the places look like a war happened. There are some places so abandoned you could set a zombie apocalypse there without a problem.  What blows my mind is while mining drove the economy for over a century and made lots of mine owners became millionaires back in the 1890s-1920s, for the average worker, it was dangerous work, and wages didn’t get good until like maybe the mid to late 1960s, stayed good with lots of jobs in the 1970s then started downsizing in the the mid-1980s and early 1990s. Then kinda collapsed by like 2005 or so.   There are tons of people I knew who suffered from black lung, or who died or were maimed in mining injuries. All to get decent pay for hard ass work.  Meanwhile coal dust covered whole communities. Mines polluted the water. Strip mines/mountain top removal mines left ugly jagged holes of exposed rock and probably polluted retaining ponds where there had been nice tree covered rolling hills. When companies reclaimed these mines after stricter environmental legislation went in, it may make it not like an abandoned borehole, but it certainly wasn’t natural.  I get wanting to have a good job, but trying to go back, won’t work. There aren’t even enough people in those communities to work the mines. If they did bring in tons of laborers, it’d probably bring tons of crime to places already struggling with the opioid epidemic that these Christian grannies would hate.  People used to tell me stories about how some of these abandoned ramshackled building used to be bars in the 1970s, with a wild nightlife and that drinking, fights, even murder happened back then because of the mine workers.  Even worse gas, wind, and solar are all cheaper now.  I get why people want to go back, the semi prosperous towns full of people bustling about is a hell of a nostalgia trip, when you live in a poor, somewhat abandoned, rundown shadow of the past, especially when you are leaving out the dirt, undrinkable brown rotten egg smelling water, and rowdy Saturday nights.",fail-deadly-,2025-05-03T03:43:54,4
