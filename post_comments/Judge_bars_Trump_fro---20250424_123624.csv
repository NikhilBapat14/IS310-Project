Has the judge similarly barred Newsome from denying state funds to 'sanctuary cities' that limit restrictions on 2nd Amendment freedoms?,Vessarionovich,2025-04-24T13:51:08,65
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A federal judge in California on Thursday barred the Trump administration from denying or conditioning the use of federal funds to “sanctuary” jurisdictions.  Appeal this decision and win it!,Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-24T12:53:21,57
I thought Donald Trump won the presidential election and not these federal judges.,triggernaut,2025-04-24T12:42:46,65
"what funds were being withheld? the bar previously was always that funds could be withheld if there was some kind of ""reasonable"" link between the condition and what the funds were going to (and ""reasonable"" was able to be stretched pretty far as shown when the federal government coerced all 50 states to raise their drinking age to 21 or lose federal highway funding)  obviously a blanket ""no funds go to these cities"" wouldn't be in compliance with what's permissible, but limiting money to police departments, schools, etc. in those cities should be permissible.",reaper527,2025-04-24T12:50:22,20
Are these judges trying to bog down the Supreme Court with idiocy?,Nianque,2025-04-25T00:31:07,3
I don't get what the issue is. This is how there's national speed limits. They conditioned federal road funding on lowering the speed limit. This is one of the levers that the federal government has. They can condition funding on policy changes.,ergzay,2025-04-24T16:56:06,7
Not sure Democrats really want the precedent set that the federal government can’t set conditions on the receipt of federal funds.,RealisticTadpole1926,2025-04-24T16:32:36,6
"Here is Article III Section 1.  The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services, a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.  NOTICE the line that it says that  ""The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour,""  I think some of these inferior court judges are NOT following good behavior. Especially when they violate laws or the Constitution to be activists.  High time someone pushed removing them due to bad behavior.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-25T04:54:50,2
The courts hate Americans,krazyellinas23,2025-04-24T14:49:23,6
I'm wondering if this is part of Trump's tactic. Obviously he's been trying to change things and sign of executive orders very very quickly. Maybe he did that because he knew that these judges would do what they're doing. Basically obstructing and being activists. So he did it early into his term so he would have time to take it to the courts before the end of his term. And hopefully get things codified,BossJackson222,2025-04-24T23:59:16,1
Lol these judges thinking they can actually do this is funny. They don't have that kind of power.,wv_lookin_around,2025-04-24T17:49:39,1
Do it anyways. Change some words and issue a new order ,Inquisitor_Machina,2025-04-24T19:44:52,1
"Problem is appeal eats up the clock, which doesn't favor Trump and these judges know that. These rulings are for obstruction's sake. Find several examples, take them to SCOTUS and get a blanket ruling limiting nationwide injunctions and put an end to this activist judicial misconduct",Cool_Cartographer_39,2025-04-24T15:59:19,31
Nah fuck em. Completely cut them off if they refuse to comply with their legally required responsibilities. And i say that as a californian.,ultrainstict,2025-04-24T14:57:57,8
