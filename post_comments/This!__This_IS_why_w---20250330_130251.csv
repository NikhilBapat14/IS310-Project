"Yep.  Ezra is encouraging the Democratic Party to adopt an Abundance Agenda, which means clearing the way for more building of things people want and need.  I’ve been hearing him talk about it for a while now, and he’s currently promoting the book he just published with Derek Thompson, so he’s showing up on all kinds of podcasts to talk about it.    The path forward involves democrats finding ways to streamline permitting processes and making regulation more functional and less obstructive.  I’d love to see the democrats  take these ideas seriously and emerge as the party that get things done as opposed to the party that blocks things from getting done… especially the things we know are needed.",JeffeyRider,2025-03-30T13:21:15,14
"The mayor of Los Angeles was on a podcast last year talking about this very problem.  My family is in telecoms and we know the struggle of the broadband rollout.  But, honestly hearing Ezra lay it out?  It was soooo disheartening.  Pete has been talking about how entire countries in Europe and the Far East East can build railroads in just one tenth of the time that we take, while shooting ourselves in the foot, over and over again.",littleoldlady71,2025-03-30T13:30:53,8
They're already the party that gets things done.  Republicans  don't care.,[deleted],2025-03-30T13:30:00,11
"They are the party that seems to genuinely *want* to get things done, but Ezra makes the case for how liberal policies hobble the actual implementation of projects like building new housing in blue states/cities.    It’s hard to hear criticism like this, but we need to address the reasons why we can pass legislation funding big projects but can’t seem to deliver the promised results.",JeffeyRider,2025-03-30T13:38:37,6
"What he is talking about, which is echoed by Tim Walz, is that, say, when someone wants to build a solar farm it can take years if not a decade or longer just to clear all of the regulations, layers, and hurdles.  The result is that what would’ve initially been a $100M one year project turns into a $1B ten+ year project. ",crucial_geek,2025-03-30T14:10:38,7
"Well, Ezra does cite NIMBYs, too. “Everyone” wants wind farms and high density housing …. Just somewhere else. ",crucial_geek,2025-03-30T14:12:41,12
"A big piece of the problem is that cities with expensive housing get more in property tax. People don’t want their house value to ever go down, either. So there are strong disincentives to building affordable housing.  Similarly, areas with higher property values, like suburbs, get to piggyback on cities for a lot of their infrastructure, yet they can afford to spend more on schools, parks, roads, etc. We have a system of government that hasn’t really even been updated for dealing with early 20th century cities, much less present reality.",GronklyTheSnerd,2025-03-30T15:10:54,3

Yes.  And NIMBYism is strong in blue cities like SF and LA.,JeffeyRider,2025-03-30T14:16:08,5

So you'd rather have no regulations so things can get built? Are you a republican?,[deleted],2025-03-31T09:35:04,1
"I'm all for reasonable regulations, but the difference between $100m and a billion are vast. I listened to that podcast and so much of the spending wasn't regulations, but Democrats hamstringing themselves and making things unnecessarily difficult. With all the black and white thinking, are you sure you're not a Republican?",Chigrrl1098,2025-03-31T14:37:02,2
"Honestly?  If I had to choose between nothing getting built like Ezra's rural broadband example and stuff getting built while ignoring regulations, I'd go for the latter.",AnotherTry1982,2025-03-31T13:01:04,1
So you're cool with toxins being dumped in your backyard? Or natural spaces bring ripped apart to install broadband?,[deleted],2025-03-31T15:58:17,1
"Why would toxins be dumped in my backyard that my own private property?   And yes, I couldn't give two shits about disrupting nature to install infrastructure.",AnotherTry1982,2025-04-01T06:17:32,0
"No regulations, they can be dumped anywhere.  Who cares if it's your private property.  What are you going to do about it? The toxins have already been dumped.  Can't sue because there's no regulation saying it can't be done.",[deleted],2025-04-01T10:23:51,1
"Why be ridiculously hyperbolic?  That serves no point in any argument.   Property rights still exist, even if every single environmental regulation was scrapped.",AnotherTry1982,2025-04-01T10:36:54,1
Ok so you're cool with toxins being dumped in the nature next to your property?  You sound republican.,[deleted],2025-04-01T10:54:53,1
"You should take a listen to the latest episode of The Weekly Show with Jon Stewart.  He interviews Ezra Klein, who is a Democrat, about how over-regulation is seriously hurting democrats.   Take a listen and then tell me if you still think the same.",AnotherTry1982,2025-04-01T11:02:35,1

"Ok, then read Ezra Klein's book.   Long story short:   They talked about how regulations are ensuring that nothing gets done.  They discussed the rural broadband initiative that was passed by Biden.  The regulations were so cumbersome that of the 56 areas identified for broadband infrastructure, only 3 of them were approved, and as of now, not a single bit of that infrastructure has been built almost 4 years after it passed.  Billions were spent on this agency checking that and another agency checking this, and literally nothing is getting built.   They also discussed building homeless housing in CA.  Again, Billions were spent with little housing built, and of the ones that were built, they all cost close to a million dollars each (these were tiny, 1 bed room homes).   They also discussed the billions spent of getting high speed rail in CA, only for 20 years later not a single piece of track has been laid.    Ezra only looked at states and initiatives that had no republican obstruction, and found that over regulation is killing democrats.   They can talk a great game when it comes to plans, but when it comes down to it, they burden themselves so much with regulations built into their own plans, that the end result either never actually gets built or what is built is ridiculously expensive.",AnotherTry1982,2025-04-01T11:16:55,1
