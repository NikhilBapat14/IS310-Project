"I hate the way this stuff gets twisted to make political opponents look bad.  It is my understanding that the amendment to the bill was to reiterate that ICE cannot detain and/or deport U.S. citizens. Which is already the law which makes this amendment is redundant. So, voting against it is just means we won't have an amendment that is redundant with what is already written law. Also, this amendment was made in response to U.S. born children being deported with their non-citizen mothers. So funds could not be used to deport citizens for any reason. Would this mean that if a non-citizen mother is deported that we separate her from her child or because the child cannot be sent with the mother that the mother should just be allowed to stay? I personally don't like the idea of separating kids from their parents and I also don't like allowing people who have entered the country illegally to remain here because it is unfair to legalized citizens.  This does not mean that a vote made it legal or was in favor of deporting U.S. citizens.",Arekage,2025-05-02T21:44:45,1

"Just for clarity, while the judiciary committee was voting on a proposed immigration bill, the Democrats proposed an amendment that would prohibit the government from deporting citizens. The Republican led committee voted against the amendment. Opposition to the amendment argued that there are already laws in place that protect citizens. However, one has to wonder what the Republicans would have lost by including it in the proposal.  So there are concerns.   However this is just a proposed immigration bill.  If it's released by the committee, then the entire house has to still vote on it.  During a house vote,  amendments can still be made to the bill. If the house passes the bill, then it goes to the Senate. The Senate can either pass, block, or pass another version of the bill. If they pass another version, there has to be reconciliation before it goes to the president for signing. So, ultimately, I'm still holding out hope that we can get some guarantees in there that citizens are not going to be deported regardless of whether there are other laws protecting us or not. As a naturalized citizen from Mexico, this hits pretty close to home.",SinisterBarrister,2025-05-01T08:50:22,0

"I didn't see anything in this entire article about that. They talked about further removing protections from immigrants, commodifying immigration similarly to the ""Gold Card"" visas, and they referenced going after non-citizen relatives of US citizens as well as a few cases where actual citizens have been deported or even sent to El Salvador. However, I did not see anything about amendments being rolled back or Trump legally removing US Citizens.",batdog20001,2025-05-01T00:59:18,7

The post is slightly misleadng. Republicans didn't vote yes on a bill that would grant the president the ability to deport US citizens. There's no such bill. They did however vote no on a bill that would be deny the president the ability to deport US citizens. Subtle yet big difference (and proof how easily we all are swayed by what we read before doing resesrch)  The post seems to purport that a bill was proposed specifically giving the president the right to deport US citizens. I think that's what some of were likely confused about. Because the article never mentioned any such bill.,SapToFiction,2025-05-01T07:50:35,13
