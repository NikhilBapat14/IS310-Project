"Let her run. In all likelihood, AOC would perform worse in a presidential debate than Biden did in 2024. Of course, radical left-of-left liberals would vote for her anyway.",chrismireya,2025-05-08T10:57:24,27
she will never get past the primaries. The money that finances presidential campaigns isn't going to her.,jcr2022,2025-05-08T14:22:42,3
"If she wasn't so brainwashed by communism and her party, she'd likely be half decent because she at least tries to represent her voters. It's the only reason she gets votes.  Lots of people voted for her and trump at the same time for that reason. The other politicians think they are above the peasant class.",RossBot5000,2025-05-08T20:53:57,3
"Old guard dems would never let her out of the primaries.   If somehow the world flipped upside down and she did make it, she‚Äôd get absolutely shelllacked in a presidential election. Think the hype of Kamala x10000000 but with probably half the votes.   My parents are old school life long moderate democrats. From families on totally different ends of the moderate spectrum. Neither has ever voted anything but democrat. They already said in 2016 if Bernie ran they couldn‚Äôt vote for him he‚Äôs too ‚Äúout there‚Äù and would prefer a McCain/romney type candidate. They both hate trump. If he ran against AOC I honestly don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôd do. Bc in 2020 they said Bernie/aoc/warren were way too extreme for their vote. But trumps not running again so if AOC is on the ticket they‚Äôd go with anyone but her.  All this to say there are a lot of democratic boomers and gen X‚Äôers like my parents and AOC at the top of the pres ticket would lose all of them.",Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-05-08T15:27:24,3

I know you are joking but you shouldn't because some people might be encouraged to go into that corrupt industry.¬†   Pornography is extremely harmful to society and I have been assured that this administration is working towards banning it completely.,JessicaRoundbottom,2025-05-08T11:45:16,-9
