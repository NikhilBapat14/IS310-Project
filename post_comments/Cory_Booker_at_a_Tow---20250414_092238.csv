And what will they do asides from making us wait two years for midterms and constantly asking for donations? This requires actual physical action.  This is WHY coups happen,disabledinaz,2025-04-15T01:38:54,2
Why he picking on Disney tho - they just said they’re committed to DEI and have been fighting against MAGA. Remember how they’re all like “go woke go broke” and Disney is fighting DeSantis. Crazy that Disney - who I used to think of an extremely conservative company - is the one everyone on the right is calling “woke.”,obilonkenobi,2025-04-14T18:46:26,1
