Mirroring US policies, Beijing in recent years has created a range of export controls, investment restrictions and regulatory investigations capable of hurting US companies. Beijing is unable to match tariff for tariff, so it will seek to impose costs in ways that inflict maximum pain. For China, failing to retaliate would signal weakness domestically and only encourage Trump.  >  > In late 2024, Xi also participated for the first time in meetings with the heads of 10 major international economic organisations.

They called it export licensing. Sounds like something a trade lawyer might actually be excited about. But make no mistake: this was a surgical strike. They didn’t need to say no. They just needed to say “maybe later” to the right set of paperwork. These licenses give Beijing control over not just where these materials go, but how fast they go, in what quantity, and to which politically convenient customers. >  > The U.S.? Let’s just say Washington should get comfortable waiting behind the rope line. The licenses have to be applied for and the end use including country of final destination must be clearly spelled out. Licenses for end uses in the U.S. are unlikely to be approved. What’s astonishing is how predictable this all was. China has spent decades building its dominance over these supply chains, while the U.S. was busy outsourcing, divesting, and cheerfully ignoring every report that said, “Hey, maybe 90% dependence on a single country we keep starting trade wars with and rattling sabers at is a bad idea.” >  > Try ramping up your semiconductor fab or solar plant when your indium source just dried up.

"China is the OPEC of rare earths.  Many of its US imports also appear to have been strategic in purpose rather than for need.

I doubt that this business will ever return and this just an opening salvo.  It appears that much of this trade was entered into chiefly to enable it to be taken away in the event of a trade dispute.  Replacing US imports with lower cost alternatives helps to offset the economic damage of a trade war and simultaneously hurts US GDP.  It also assists in opening up new trade relationships with tariff affected economies and displacing US trade.  Europe is presently hesitating at accepting overtures from China but as this drags on it will eventually stop playing hard to get.  Germany is considering removal of its gold reserves from the Federal Reserve. This is indicative of the loss of trust an confidence in the USA.
