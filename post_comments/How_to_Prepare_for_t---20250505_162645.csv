"You are correct. The elephant in the room is too much for the nation to fully comprehend because it would start a panic.   Economies with substantial reserves of US Treasury bonds , particularly China and Japan , are forced into accessing these for economic stimulus and support payments.  This is the whole purpose of bond and gold reserves. When economic conditions deteriorate then these nations must draw on reserves to protect economies.  When the US is no longer seen as a safe store of wealth it then provides more impetus to draw down on reserves. Especially so when the US is the source of this economic turmoil.  This also deflates the value of the USD and increases sovereign risk of default on the tens of trillions in US debt. It can spark a downward spiral in confidence.  Economies may soon decide that it better to jettison US Treasury bonds while they retain some value and avoid being left holding the baby.   A crashed bond market and USD will make the US unable to extract itself from economic recession as it has done before.   Without an attractive store of capital it will have enormous difficulty in raising capital for national investment and stimulus.   Should it default then it will throw the global economy into a deep recession or depression.",iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-05-05T20:08:39,6

"A collapse of the bond market and devaluation of the USD will result in this but you are correct.  The USD is so shaky , for a number of reasons , that it will be too dangerous to use for international trade and investment.  Also, Project 2025 has the USD returning to the gold standard.  Germany is currently considering removal of its gold reserves from the Federal Reserve to pre-empt any appropriation by Trump of international gold reserves.

Institutional reform progress will also be crucial for the yuan's growth. >  > Digital currencies, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, are vying for a slice of the dollar's pie.
