"Outrageous. Why does anything remotely sexual in nature have to be in any kids books, or even middle school books? There's enough stuff out there for kids to learn about and from without injecting any sex stuff.",triggernaut,2025-04-24T06:44:35,28
"And they're being used in English language instruction at age 3?"" Gorsuch asked.   ""'Pride Puppy!' was the book that was used for the pre-kindergarten curriculum. That's no longer in the curriculum,"" replied Schoenfeld.  ""That's the one where they're supposed to look for the leather and things - and bondage – things like that,"" Gorsuch responded.   ""It's not bondage. It's a woman in a leather...""  A ""Sex worker?"" asked Gorsuch.  ""No. That's not correct. No,"" replied Schoenfeld.  ""Gosh, I read it...drag queen?"" said Gorsuch.  Schoenfeld said the leather is actually a woman in a leather jacket and that ""one of the words is drag queen.""   The high court was hearing arguments in the case brought by religious parents who say young children can’t be expected to separate a teacher’s moral messages from their family’s beliefs.   What insanity!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-24T07:39:19,10

"So the person in question is wearing a black leather jacket, a bareriff halter top, leopard print pants, and a black choker necklace with a heart on it not too different than that  you would find on a dog collar.  Underneath are the words ""L is for leash""  [https://munrobooks.com/item/qcvBnpROh4NLRWkbHwmQ1Q/lists/lTSVnSVHtYw/](https://munrobooks.com/item/qcvBnpROh4NLRWkbHwmQ1Q/lists/lTSVnSVHtYw/)  If Gorsuch ever searched Pride Puppy images it's not surprising that he would think that this picture is a reference to puppy fetish/domination.",49thbotdivision,2025-04-24T12:57:30,2
">Why does anything remotely sexual in nature have to be in any kids books, or even middle school books?  Because sexual partner preference is no longer just one of many traits a person possesses. It is now, for some, a fundamental identity. It is the lens through which they view the world around them. It shapes their opinions, decisions and actions...even when it comes to educating children. Think of it as their guiding belief system. But unlike other belief systems, theirs is taught in public schools to rooms full of captive school children who have no power to question the doctrine.",Farmwife64,2025-04-24T08:55:58,22
They had these books in the curricula for *pre-kindergarteners*. For 3-4 year olds! If that isn't attempted indoctrination I don't know what is.  Opt-outs are allowed for books that depict Muhammed but they *want to force this crap on toddlers!*,social_dinosaur,2025-04-24T07:45:39,25

"It's literally a step towards A Brave New World, where they attempt to indoctrinate kids into casual sex well before puberty.",Mountain_Man_88,2025-04-24T08:05:16,14
It's disgusting. There should be no sexual references of any kind in material for kids that age.,social_dinosaur,2025-04-24T08:14:53,12
Sadly 2 or 3 Supreme Court justices will likely disagree with you,BrockLee76,2025-04-24T10:11:41,4
