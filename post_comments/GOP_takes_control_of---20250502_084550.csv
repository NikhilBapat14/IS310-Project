This is why JB Pritzker said republicans can’t know peace. They are not allowing peaceful transfers of power and are actively warmongering with NATO allies. There is no choice but for the party to be outright gutted for their devotion to the 34 time felon.,AdOne5089,2025-05-02T15:50:12,7
Well that adds North Carolina to a rapidly growing list of places I wouldn't want to live.   There's so few states left that seem safe to live in now if you're not a Republican or Christian.

"This is  what I’ve been saying since Cheeto palpatine took office. they are openly doing these horrible horrific things because the plan has always been this. their plans for this shit show to go beyond 2028. they want a permanent, long lasting fascist regime for decades. That’s why every republican hasn’t been backing away or openly defying these orders and actions. they are all in, because they know they are fucked if a fair or safe midterm election was to happen. They’d get massacred in the primaries if they went ahead with this shit. that’s why they aren’t even flinching at the thought of losing their seats. because there will be no safe and fair elections going forward.",Theartcritc26,2025-05-03T03:43:07,1

"Or are disenfranchised by the bullshit pulled by our corrupt government, or just straight up cheating as NC has had literally verified cases of election fraud by Republicans. Even when a plurality of our state votes for Democrats they only get a minor amount of representation.

"They trojan-horsed a ""progressive"" Democrat into office (looking at you Trish), only for her to turncoat into a conservative Republican, so that they could have the power to override vetos, and then rammed through regressive anti-reproductive rights legislation. And then they redrew her district as a favor to enable her reelection.   They mock us by pretending they represent some mandate of the people. We're as purple a state as you can get, leaning more blue year by year. Yet our productive and growing urban population is increasingly disenfranchised and underrepresented. Fuck what these shitheels are doing to this state.",dietTAB,2025-05-02T09:24:28,40

"We are kind of in the same situation. We live in a place where, although home prices have gone up, they're still below the average. Mississippi has a low cost of living too which sounds great until you look into the politics and policy.  Right now Tate Reeves is trying to get disaster aid from the federal government and Trump, just like with Arkansas, is shutting it down. There was major damage from tornadoes in March. And Mississippi also just passed a bill to abolish the income tax with nothing to recoup that funding. They've been trying to pass school vouchers for years now and looks like SCOTUS is going to give them everything they need to start funneling public school money into private Christian schools and destroy the public school system in the state.  It's a hole we have to dig ourselves out from and for a lot of people it's impossible without help.",pontiacfirebird92,2025-05-02T12:07:04,0
