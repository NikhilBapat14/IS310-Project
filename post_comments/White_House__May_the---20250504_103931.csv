"It baffles me that..  1. That the official White House X account is run by people that think this is anything other than cringe. 2.

What is his point? Because obviously these posts are trying to be controversial and stir up shit. It’s trivial to give him a green or blue saber with AI. Is someone in his ear telling him young voters love this shit or something?   Puzzling.,keyToOpen,2025-05-04T13:57:25,125

"They need to knock it off with this AI image nonsense. The Gaza video, the pope, and now this. All are bad optics and serve no purpose.

"Absolutely agree! However, when the post was specifically intended to piss people off, uses AI to make the sitting President look super muscular, and is tweeted out by the official White House account, it feels less like enjoying some harmless fun and more like shitty propaganda to trigger the libs.

"<nerd>  Swap that to canon and you’ll find that the colors have meaning (and derive from the user’s stance in the Force), and red comes from bleeding the crystal. Based on the canon interpretation and the way we see colors manifest, it is my contention that not only is red the wrong color, purple or white would be the correct color.   This because purple is indicative of both raw power and balance in the Force. Mace Windu exemplifies both, hence his purple blade. Trump would fall into a similar category with the way he’s been playing his cards lately (a balance between aggressive pressure and standard diplomacy).   White is what happens when you purify/heal a bled crystal, which in our context here would be symbolic of the healing our nation is experiencing.   <\nerd>",FlyJunior172,2025-05-04T11:28:25,-33

"Voting for him. I’ve always viewed President Trump as a rocket. A lot of energy, a lot of fire, and when pointed in the right direction, un-stoppable. During his first presidency he had all of this but also a team behind him that could direct and focus things. Now his team seems content to do what ever to make him happy as long as they keep their jobs. I only see it getting more divisive and shitty if this continues. What’s the plan? Liberals aren’t going anywhere. Is this all the American presidency is now? One group gets in and shits on the opposition for 4 years then we switch. How can a country move forward like that?
