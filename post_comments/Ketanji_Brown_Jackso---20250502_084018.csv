"**From reporter Marita Vlachou:**  U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson on Thursday slammed the “relentless attacks” judges across the country face, suggesting that such intimidation tactics mimic those used by authoritarian governments, according to multiple news reports.  In an appearance at the First Circuit Judicial Conference in Puerto Rico, Jackson proceeded to address what she described as the “elephant in the room,” without explicitly mentioning President Donald Trump’s name.  Jackson condemned the “relentless attacks and disregard” judges are confronted with daily, urging them to stand strong as she spoke out about the message that targeting judges sends.  “The attacks are not random. They seem designed to intimidate those of us who serve in this critical capacity,” Jackson added, according to Politico. “The threats and harassment are attacks on our democracy.”  Since his inauguration in January, Trump and his allies have adopted an openly hostile and combative attitude toward judges who have stood in the way of the government’s priorities.

"Yeah, because one person is the equivalent of an entire party apparatus ignoring the courts. Ignoring the fact that widespread threats are used even against their own party members.
