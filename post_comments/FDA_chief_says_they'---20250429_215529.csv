"FFS - this flu and covid season was brutal at the school I work at. We had kids hospitaized for both. I had covid for the second time at the end of August and I'm so thankful I was vaccinated because I just had minimal symptoms. I always get the flu shot, the adults who caught it didn't get vaccinated this year. It was proper respiratory agony. This is just letting people potentially die when they don't need to.",chimarya,2025-04-29T22:00:15,88

Another big reason is sadly economic - if lots of people are missing work because of sickness it affects our GDP in a very real way. Really stupid to not recommend everyone get vaccines for a preventable disease that is still very widespread.,tiny_galaxies,2025-04-30T00:37:56,3
"It will help in the very immediate short term, ths year, but it won't really matter by next year. The boosters don't last that long, and the vaccines are calibrated based on the dominant strain that year.  If you can't keep reupping on the vaccines each year, by just one skipped year you'll be completely vulnerable again. Like the flu, COVID is endemic in the population now and reproduces very quickly and mutates strain such that any inocculation will only be seasonal, as with the flu.

"OK but, getting it this year helps you not at all next year, and I want to make that clear because you seem to be implying that them not approving it next year means people should rush to get it this year and those two things have no relation to one another.   It is already approved this year. It will not be revoked this year. What they are talking about is whether to approve next years'.   And the reason next years will require approval is because it will be to immuninize people against *next years' strain*.   So what you do now will have no bearing on it being banned in the future.   It's always a good idea to get the vaccine, but there's no ""urgency"" for this year based on this news. You'll be able to get it this year, and then by next year it will vanish, and by that time it will not matter whether you got it this year or not.",StoppableHulk,2025-04-29T22:04:41,7
"There will still be conserved parts of the spike protein in next year's viral strain, so there's still a possibility that there will be a small, but non-zero, protective factor from at least getting this year's before it's not available any more. Obviously far, far below the protective value of a newer, tailored vaccine for next year, but with the effects of long COVID and the risk of death (especially for someone immunocompromised like myself), 5% protection is still better than 0%.",platinumarks,2025-04-30T01:38:23,2
"It's my understanding that being vaccinated helps with the immune system's memory cells.  The long-term protection doesn't ""vanish,"" but the antibodies do.  However, you aren't set back to square one when those antibodies are gone.  You won't have the antibodies drifting around after a certain period, but your immune system has the memory cells and the more often you remind those memory cells with vaccines, the better.  I believe there have been numerous studies that show the more vaccinated you are, the better off you are with Covid.  Similar to H5N1 where anyone who had the H1N1 shot back in 2009 is thought to be better off than someone who never did if H5N1 becomes a problem.  H1N1 is also present in this year's flu shot.  I would still rather have antibodies drifting around from a recent Covid shot whenever I would come into contact with someone with Covid.  This is an extremely short-sighted and political decision by the CDC.  But going with the recommendation to have boosters once a year instead of every 6 months for the general population was a political decision as they hoped people would be more likely to get a Covid shot with their flu shot in the fall.  That didn't pan out.  This is going to be a mess.  ETA:  downvoted for the facts.  Thanks, guys.",koi-lotus-water-pond,2025-04-29T22:31:51,1
