"Joining NATO would make it easier to coordinate with other NATO members and essentially just makes things easier in a possible attack.  Furthermore, there is a bit of politics here.  Sweden has always been heavily involved within NATO, despite being a non-member, but declared themselves ""neutral"" as it was viewed as a good compromise to help prevent the USSR/Russia from invading.  The fact that Russia invaded Ukraine pretty much made the policy come off as irrelevant and Sweden is stating they now view Russia as a hostile threat.",Naliamegod,2023-04-05T22:12:34,10
The Baltic Sea is small and of crucial importance to Sweden.  Russia regularly probes Swedish waters.   Being part of a more unified sea control regime benefits Sweden.,RingAny1978,2023-04-06T00:20:29,4
