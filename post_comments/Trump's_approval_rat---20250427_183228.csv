"Seeing the MAGAats cope hard at this ""liberal propaganda,"" even though the Fox News poll showed the same... It's priceless. Likely to get a lot worse within a few months when all this chaos catches up with the store shelves.",krozarEQ,2025-04-27T19:19:32,2

"Trump has caused harm to every type of person from scientists, farmers, veterans, immigrants, teachers, students, people in poverty, medical research, weather services, FDA, natural disaster relief, USDA, USAID, and I'm sure there's more.

Best of luck and take care.",a_little_hazel_nuts,2025-04-27T19:22:47,1

"When Trump puts on his spray tan in the morning, he dupes himself into believing there is some sort of ""strongman"" staring back at him in the mirror.  Normal people see a weak, desperate, and pathetic old man who is fucking up at every turn.",gradientz,2025-04-27T20:52:49,2
