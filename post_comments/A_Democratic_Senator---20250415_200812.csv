"So... Let me follow this logic for a second...  Say El Salvador does the unthinkable and says sure, you can have him, but if he is deported he comes right back to us and you (the senator) are on the hook for him. And this senator brings him back onto the US.  Since he's not legally allowed to be here, and he's already got a deportation order that's just held up by judicial gobbledygook... What's to stop the government from meeting them at the airport, grabbing the illegal in question, and slapping cuffs on the senator for aiding and abetting the guy with illegal entry into the country?",TheIncredibleHork,2025-04-15T20:52:09,171

"They're so out of touch with the majority of US citizens on immigration, it's insane. Nayib Buleke is no fool, he's going to have field day making them look even more ridiculous than they already do over this one. The Democratic Party is in need of a total overhaul. Even Gavin Newsom's attempts to float himself as a moderate seem laughable. They need to pick a real issue, not a manufactured one, that actually resonates with the majority of US voters and come up with some real solutions or we're going to have a one party system in this country sooner or later.  This whole 'bring the illegal immigrant back from his country of origin isn't it'. They can attempt to paint the situation however they want, but the majority of US isn't going to buy it.",According-Activity87,2025-04-15T20:28:29,53

Any immigration lawyers in this thread? Does this document not state that his Withhold for Removal status is specific to Guatemala? Or am I reading this wrong. Seems as though the media is outright lying(shocking) about not being able to be sent to El Salvador at all.   https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mdd.578815/gov.uscourts.mdd.578815.1.1_3.pdf,who_dis62,2025-04-15T21:16:21,40

"If USAID has shown us anything, the answer to your second question would be absolutely not.  On top of that, Bukele specifically mentioned that he’s not gonna do shit when it comes to this matter, and rightfully so. The not so alleged MS-13 member has already received an order of deportation in 2019, after he went through the immigration court system. The Trump administration was well within its right to deport this man.  He’s not our problem anymore, and what Bukele does with him isn’t our problem either.",Ok-Willow-4232,2025-04-15T20:25:04,47

"Having reviewed the same document, it definitely says Guatemala, meaning that his Withholding of Removal order only precluded him from being removed to Guatemala. Unless there's some other document that also includes El Salvador then this whole thing is just a farce.   According to [this legal analysis](https://cis.org/Arthur/Judge-Orders-Return-Alien-Removed-El-Salvador-Administrative-Error) there's no record of the actual order in the guys court case. There's only the document that you linked, which is essentially a memo explaining the reasoning behind the decision which *should be* documented as a minute order. If the minute order materializes, it's possible that the memo says Guatemala in error and the actual order says El Salvador, but in the absence of a conflicting minute order we're left to believe that Guatemala is the country that he was precluded from being removed to.",Mountain_Man_88,2025-04-15T21:56:29,41
"I’m still a bit confused   He’s allegedly NOT affiliated with any gang, but cannot be sent “home” because of risk of gang retaliation… why is this one random guy at risk of gang violence yet he has nothing to do with them?",Baptism-Of-Fire,2025-04-16T00:56:02,36

"The order goes through the testimony. It says the guy’s mother sold pupusas out of the family home and the gang demanded a cut of the earnings. When the mom said no, the gang threatened the kids (guy + his siblings, this was years ago) and later tried to recruit the guy in exchange for the family not paying. The family moved but not very far, so the gang found the new home and kept harassing and threatening the family.",Jellyfish1297,2025-04-16T08:31:12,41
And that gang is now completely wiped off the street.  So the logical conclusion to all of this is:  Send him back to America  Stay of deportation terminated because threat at home is gone  Deport him back   Checkbox Due Process  right?,Baptism-Of-Fire,2025-04-16T11:30:11,1
