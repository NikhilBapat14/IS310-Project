"During the sit down with Carney, Trump was rambling how Obama's Library is over budget because of DEI. And he said something to the effect of ""I've brought in 1.. 2... 9 Trillion of business"" while GDP actually contracted in q1",Chaz_wazzers,2025-05-07T14:48:14,4
"**From reporter Marco Margaritoff:**  CNN fact-checker Daniel Dale says President Donald Trump did “better than usual” Tuesday — and told only two lies about America’s trade relationship with Canada — during his Oval Office meeting earlier that day with newly elected Prime Minister Mark Carney.  “President Trump did not repeat a lot of the lies about Canada that I’ve been fact-checking for months,” Dale confirmed on the air Tuesday. “I counted at least 11 false claims from the president about Canada in 2025; he told two of them, by my count, during this meeting.”  “So, better than usual,” he continued. “But it’s worth fact-checking those two.”  The falsehoods in question: Trump claimed during his televised meeting with Carney that the U.S. subsidizes Canada “to the tune of maybe $200 billion a year” — and that America doesn’t “do much business” with the continental ally.  “This $200 billion figure he uses to describe the trade deficit with Canada … it’s imaginary,” Dale explained Tuesday. “The trade deficit with Canada is not even close to that high. It was about $36 billion, not $200 billion, last year.”  “Even if you only count goods trade, ignore the services trade at which the U.S. excels, \[it’s\] about $71 billion,” he continued. “So, just wrong.”  Here's a link to the full article: [https://www.huffpost.com/entry/daniel-dale-biggest-lies-donald-trump-mark-carney-meeting\_n\_681b2f60e4b0c2b15d96e757?utm\_medium=Social&utm\_source=reddit&utm\_campaign=us\_main](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/daniel-dale-biggest-lies-donald-trump-mark-carney-meeting_n_681b2f60e4b0c2b15d96e757?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=us_main)",huffpost,2025-05-07T14:31:57,5
