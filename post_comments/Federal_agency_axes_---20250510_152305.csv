">An annual theater festival dedicated to showcasing the work of playwrights from countries that criminalize or censor the LGBTQ community has turned to online fundraising after the National Endowment for the Arts revoked the New York festival’s grant.  >In December, the independent federal agency awarded a $20,000 grant to the [National Queer Theater](https://www.nationalqueertheater.org/), a nonprofit theater company based in Brooklyn, for its 2025 [Criminal Queerness Festival](https://www.nationalqueertheater.org/cqf2025). It was the third year the company was awarded an NEA grant, which made up 20% of the festival’s total budget, according to Jess Ducey, co-chair of the company’s board.  >The NEA [began revoking arts funding](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/03/us/trump-news-updates?unlocked_article_code=1.EU8.ayo2.luUM4Q6VD4aZ&smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare) for a number of organizations, including the National Queer Theater, on Friday. That day, the agency told the theater in an email that it “is updating its grantmaking policy priorities to focus funding on projects that reflect the nation’s rich artistic heritage and creativity as prioritized by the President,” according to a copy of the email that Ducey shared with NBC News.  >The NEA did not immediately return a request for comment. The agency is currently experiencing a broader upheaval, [with several of its senior leaders stepping down](https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/2025/05/07/nea-staff-departure/) this week after President Donald Trump released a proposed budget Friday that would eliminate its funding, The Washington Post reported.  Loud echoes of the Nazi party's ""Degenerate Art"" label with this one.     Apparently, LGBTQIA+ art does not ""reflect the nation’s rich artistic heritage"".     Between this and the trans military ban, this is just another way by the Christian nationalists to say that LGBTQIA+ people ""poison America"", so they can justify their genocide of us.",southpawFA,2025-05-10T15:27:21,1
