They made up the critical race theory controversy and it worked. They play up migrant caravans leading up to elections and it works.

It's not, trans rights are human rights, full stop.   She's right, we should focus on things that matter, like protecting trans healthcare.   Watching healthcare professionals change the language they use to address trans issues in the face of hostility at the Federal level has been infuriating. They legally have to provide care that is sub-optimal, that is an issue that matters and should be addressed.

"The movement of being anti semitic because of racial eugenics was very new and was quickly followed by camps, showing that new spinnings of old ideas like anti semitism and homophobia can snowball quickly.  If you look at project 2025, their roadmap, which they have been following, which everyone said they wouldn't, and then everyone said they wouldn't break the laws and the Constitution to do other bits (which they've been doing) it says that trans people existing is pornographic and they will be put into a slight rewording of concentration camps.  the largest difference is it seems like we're only at foreign based camps and prisons where they torture people with no due process, and not mass killings, and I doubt we get there while everyone is fat and happy.",Robin_games,2025-05-06T15:41:34,39

Transphobia and physical violence against trans people has absolutely been embedded in western culture for the last century at least. Looking at police violence and murder stats, not to mention pop culture (Ace Ventura Pet Detective, Boys Don't Cry etc.) are a testament to this. It's actually only within the last 15-ish years that trans people have actually begun to be viewed as human or in any kind of sympathetic light.

"> there isn’t a hundreds year old history of antisemitism like Germany had that is equivalent to trans people in the US, it is a relatively new thing.  Might I recommend Jules Gil-Peterson's A Brief History of Transmisogyny?\* Transmisogyny has more of a history than it might seem to. Is it completely comparable to antisemitism in Europe? No, of course not. But there's more similarity than I expected before I read the book.  Which isn't to say you're wrong, exactly, but is to say that American transmisogyny is poorly understood as a historical subject.  \* Though maybe take the section on the Hijra and the section on Mujerisma with a grain of salt - her work on US history is incredibly strong, but her understanding of non-US gender identities is often a bit reductive. Talia Bhatt's essay [The Third Sex](https://taliabhattwrites.substack.com/p/the-third-sex) offers a pointed critique on what western queer studies elides in the case of the Hijra and speaks directly to Gil-Peterson's work in one section.",BendItLikeBedrot,2025-05-06T20:00:25,9

"In the mid 00s I nearly got murdered while walking home from school, and I didn't even have a firm grasp on why because we didn't have the word for it yet.      I was still crying when I got home, and my parents happened to be home, so they dragged me to a police station to report the attack. The officer was leaned over and taking careful notes right up until he heard the slur I was called during the attack. That prompted him to actually take a good look at me, straighten up, step back, snap his notebook shut, and declare there was nothing they could do to help me.      Most adults in my life kept telling me that I was too old to still be a tomboy. I was getting desperately confused because I assumed from all those country songs that tomboys grew up into beautiful wives/mothers but I didn't feel like my ""womany"" ever came in. I thought femininity was like brain tits, that eventually I'd develop that aspect other girls and women all seemed to have.      When I finally told my mom all that as best I could, she just hugged me, said I'm a *person* and it's *fine*. Asked what gendered words I was comfortable with, literally asked my pronouns like a decade before that became a thing.  Turns out the term is non-binary but we'd just never heard of it before. Closest reference point we had to work with was that we'd spent the 90s watching reruns of MASH together.

"Sorry for the late reply, but I wanted to give this the attention it deserves. My husband is Canadian and we are rushing to go up ASAP. We’re finalizing all of the paperwork.   So, what we’re trying to do first is connect. We’re using Signal to do that but I’m starting to think even Signal isn’t secure. The first step is to know who and where your friends are. If you want a way to let people know you’re an ally , displaying a Blåhaj shark from IKEA. It’s a bit more discreet. Unfortunately any symbol people come up with will be spread on social media, so I’m not sure there’s another way, but displaying the shark will help.  We’ve got a few people in the Midwest, but mostly we’ve started to organize in the East Coast. I think the next step would be to figure out who is able and willing to provide transportation. There are about 3 or 4 people in my network who have stepped forward including me. For larger networks I’m not really sure how to connect but I think just reaching out will be a good start. Any online group you’re a part of, start talking about it. Also figure out who’s willing to provide housing, and start getting the resources together. Create a master list of safe housing or homes that are willing to safely harbor people.  What I think might have to happen if it gets to that point is that Canada might have to seriously consider taking in people from down here seeking asylum, so I think what you can do is figure out which politicians are willing to do that for the queer community. Get in touch with them and don’t give up until they write back to let you know their position on protecting queer asylum seekers from the US. They will also be fairly safe up in New England, for as long as we can hold it off. The scariest thing is we don’t know how far they are willing to go, and if/when we reach that tipping point it’s going to be a free for all down here. People in VT, Massachusetts, and some of the Midwest states have already expressed our willingness to be the first line of defense for Canada.   Godspeed.
