">The biggest problem the country has is him, period.  I wish that were true. 1/3 if the population elected Trump twice. 1/3 couldn’t be bothered to show up at the polls. The US has some soul-searching to do. This didn’t happen overnight, and it didn’t start in 2016.  Sorry.",sharp11flat13,2025-05-08T05:30:04,4
">Americans do not need to spend as much money on “junk we don’t need.”     ... says the donation-begging, junk-selling billionaire, with the gilded 3-story NYC penthouse and gold-plated seatbelt buckles in his private jet ...  .... as he   * orders the termination of tens of thousands of Americans, * destroys US university research funding sources and int'l goodwill, * hangs farmers out to dry due to foreign boycotts and retaliatory tariffs,  * closes federal agencies designed to protect, support, and help Americans, * buries small businesses and retailers with import fees,   * dooms young professionals with unexpected student loan forfeitures     The only people who will thrive in Trump's Economy are ""compliant"" billionaires.    Any billionaire wielding a chainsaw to money and resources that DO NOT BELONG TO HIM, should be illegal.  It is certainly obscene.",XSinTrick6666,2025-05-08T03:51:11,13
"No, they will be included in your taxes increase! Mandatory to have a tesla and starlink!!!  Banking will be centralized around X, same for news.  Federal approved ID required for everything,, even buying groceries... Remember Trump said we need ID to buy tomatoes.  After all of those great improvements, welcome to better America.  The government will know where you drive, who you talk to, what you eat, your face will be automatically searched for gathering the most important information they can get.  And AI will decide your level of risks. Libruls? You don't deserve credit and we should deport you. MAGA? you will have a great credit.  We are close to this.

"By extension, his voters and the complacent. I have nothing but disdain for these people.  There's plenty of blame to go around. The media, a failing educational system, a decline in values and critical thinking skills, the list goes on.

You are right. I stand corrected. Thank you.,sharp11flat13,2025-05-08T06:14:13,4
">There's plenty of blame to go around. The media, a failing educational system, a decline in values and critical thinking skills, the list goes on. If you go back far enough, Reagan is the one that set all of this in motion.  I agree entirely. And actually I think it can be argued that it goes back much further than that, or Reagan would never have been elected.  In a democracy, the government is a reflection of the culture and I believe America has some soul-searching to do. The cultural problems you face are common to all modern industrialized democracies, but they seem to be on steroids in the US and to fix them you’re going to have to understand why that is.  So I think the US is at a turning point, and it will be up to its citizens whether it engages in self-reflection or digs in its heels.  Best of luck to you.",sharp11flat13,2025-05-08T10:07:58,2
