"This whole Greenland drama is one of the many things I hate about this administration. There is nothing productive or positive about it. Okay yes, Greenland sits in a strategic position, but it's controlled by an ally, and not just an ally, but an ally who allows us to have our military stationed there. Having control over the Arctic and the North Atlantic is very important, but we already fucking do. What added value will come from acquiring Greenland?  The more this administration talks about acquiring Greenland, the worse our country looks on the world stage. We are losing friends. Part of our power and influence comes from how many countries actually fucking like and trust us. We are eroding our friendships and therefore eroding our power and influence.  I honestly don't get it. Like, no matter how many forms of mental gymnastics I attempt, I still don't get it. For issues like healthcare, I can at least understand the right's logical arguments, even if I do disagree with them, but at least I get it. Greenland, on the other hand, I just cannot understand.",LoudCrickets72,2025-03-30T15:53:24,39

Look at what Canadian did then follow suit. A slap with a pair of gloves across the snout 🐽 and a challenge to a dual in a cage match with dumpster would get the  point across!!😆😆😆.,renegadeindian,2025-03-30T17:10:37,3

"We’re not losing friends, we’re changing sides. That’s what I think a lot of people are missing here. This isn’t incompetence, it’s malice.",abstrakt42,2025-03-30T16:27:18,27
"I think that most of it, is trump larping as a ""scary dictator"", like his strongman heroes Putin, Jong Un, Xi and Orban. He wants *his* own countries to invade and conquer too",LivingIndependence,2025-03-30T18:15:49,3
"It’s one of those things that might not even make sense to him, but he probably views it as just sitting there.  I’ll bet that he overheard someone say it once and was like, “Oh yeah, that’ll make me the most popular President ever.” ",crucial_geek,2025-03-30T18:12:20,2
