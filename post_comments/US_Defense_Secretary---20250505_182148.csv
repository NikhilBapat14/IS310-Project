"Destabilizing military command seems to be a very pro Russia plan, which seems to be well aligned with Trump’s overall record. And Congress remains silent and complicit with this treachery.",Tballz9,2025-05-05T18:26:32,69
Are they preparing for dictatorship by carrying out a military purge like the CCP?,Altruistic_Worth1663,2025-05-05T18:27:00,48
"After the national security nightmare of multiple horrible scandals with Signal chats, why is this dysfunctional alcoholic still in any position of power, let alone have the power to fire other people who are actually qualified for their jobs, as demonstrated by decades of service?",AbcLmn18,2025-05-05T18:27:09,27

So it's a coup?,Designer-Contract852,2025-05-05T19:47:02,6
It’s amazing how on one hand they say they need more funding for the military to boost it because Biden left it failed and weak. But then also want to cut a huge portion of the leadership.  The plan should be obvious to anyone with a brain. Build a huge military whose leadership is committed to trump and not the constitution. This should terrify all of us.,tresben,2025-05-05T19:04:10,5
"I hope you guys realize that this is a coup. They're going to ax any senior officer with a sense of duty, and keep only the ones loyal to Trump.",Prudent-Blueberry660,2025-05-05T22:52:02,6

"Not just pro-Russia, but it’s a quintessential step in taking power as a dictator.   I was just reading a book called How Dictatorships Work 2 days ago and it talks about how incoming dictators will remove existing high-ranking military officers and put inexperienced civilians over the military in order to reduce the autonomy of the military and therefore reduce the chances of the military challenging their power and decisions.   And now this news. Terrifying.",New_Independent5819,2025-05-05T23:54:03,12
