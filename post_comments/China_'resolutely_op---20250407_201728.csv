"As China has every right to do.    Trump, like most conservatives, seem to forget that in the 19th century during the opium wars the West humiliated China because of their weakness. China will never forget that and they are not weak anymore.   They will not allow Trump to humiliate them.     But Trump has fired everyone who has any real competence, replacing them with political sycophants. So he has no one to advise him what a stupid thing he's doing.   If he doesn't stop acting crazy this whole thing could blow up in a manner that will do a lot more damage to the United States and its economy and place in the world than it will to China's.    I hate Nixon and I hate Trump but in different ways. Nixon at least had the sense to reach across a wide political and ideological gulf to engage with China.   Trump is just plain stupid.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-07T20:42:06,1

The Chinese have lots and lots of leverage because the US has become ridiculously dependent on them in so many ways. Trump is a complete idiot but unfortunately he was elected by idiots who worship him and his party are a bunch of sycophants who will not stand in his way.    To make matters worse Trump has replaced anyone with any competence with nothing but political sycophants. So he's got no one to give him sensible advice even if he was willing to listen to it which he isn't.   This is going to end very badly.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-07T20:47:02,1
