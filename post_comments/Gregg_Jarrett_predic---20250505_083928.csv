I don't think we need to waste the time and money on this.  To bring it back to operational standards would cost more than it would to construct a new prison.,bw2082,2025-05-05T08:46:52,417
Waste of time. That dilapidated old shack is better left as a museum and attraction. You can build a new and better prison much cheaper than renovating that heap.,LemartesIX,2025-05-05T09:56:55,182
Maybe he could re-open Shawshank next.,deathwheel,2025-05-05T10:11:13,121
I don't know. Is there a shortage of space for federal inmates? Are prisoners escaping federal prisons? That was the advantage of Alcatraz.,chrismireya,2025-05-05T09:21:44,87
I think we have more pressing issues than this,Siciliantony1,2025-05-05T09:01:41,101
Most expensive appartment block for 400 residents.   Perhaps the most expensive neighborhood in the entire bay area,Dutchtdk,2025-05-05T09:53:54,50
"I dont think he really is going to do it. I think its a troll but he has something else on mind. It cost too much to bring it up to now standards. They would have to basically tear it all down, and it has national historical  landmark status.",AtomicFox84,2025-05-05T08:53:54,15
"If he follows the predictable *Art Of The Deal* path with this, it begins with a ""Send them to El Salvador"" pitch, simmers down to Alcatraz, and ends with the concession everyone here is proposing, which is just another supermax/pen inland.",Right_Archivist,2025-05-05T11:17:03,7
"There is plenty of open desert in the SW.   A tent, a cot, 3 hots and if they are good, AC for a few hours a day.   Problem solved for a fraction of the cost. ",Long_Jelly_9557,2025-05-05T09:19:13,2
"At this point it'd be fair to predict an avalanche of lawsuits for anything Trump does.  The left will file a lawsuit against Trump for tearing the ""do not remove"" tag off a new mattress.",Shadeylark,2025-05-05T11:07:35,-1
"I predict the President will move away from this when he realizes the absurd cost it would take to obliterate an historical monument, and try to renovate an almost century old prison that hasn't operated in seven decades, built on top of a Civil War era base, in a wildly inconvenient place to build.  Modern supermaxes are much more secure and more affordable to operate.",cathbadh,2025-05-05T18:42:37,1
Good - more lawsuits for them to waste their money on.,777_heavy,2025-05-05T09:20:58,-6
"I get what he's after, he wants criminals to sweat. I think he's also an older guy and during his younger years, Alcatraz was a symbol that struck fear.  On the other side of the coin, Trump loves to troll folks, especially Democrats. Let him have his fun, and let them throw their fits; all part of the games he loves to play.",darlox,2025-05-05T17:55:54,0
He's just trolling in all his greatness.,Capable_Obligation96,2025-05-05T18:00:15,0
He’s not going to do this folks,legitSTINKYPINKY,2025-05-05T12:42:13,-5
"More lawsuits that Trump will win. We need to reopen Alcatraz, or at least have something similar.",theboss2461,2025-05-05T08:40:41,-38
You would think that by now people would get that he’s trolling!   Alcatraz is a museum. They are not reopening that.,VastusAnimus,2025-05-05T10:43:39,-8
Agreed. Plus its a tourist attraction and museum now. No point ruining that.,Merax75,2025-05-05T09:46:19,206
Who said anything about bringing it back to operational standards? /j,whicky1978,2025-05-05T20:44:40,-4
I think that's the end goal. I don't think anyone would actually consider remodeling Alcatraz. Moreso just using that term as a metaphor/comparison. We need a new prison like Alcatraz.,theboss2461,2025-05-05T08:50:06,-134
"I visited Alcatraz during a trip to the Bay Area (as part of my first internship with NASA). Oddly enough, I was able to purchase a ticket at the booth on the Embarcadero.   I remember being more amazed by the views of the Bay, Golden Gate Bridge, Bay Bridge, etc. than the prison itself. It was cold, dank, dirty and dark. Apart from its history, Alcatraz was just a very old ""hard time"" prison in a very interesting location.   Following grad school, my wife and I moved to the nearby Silicon Valley. I've asked her if she wanted to tour. She said, ""No."" We've already taken numerous Blue & Gold Fleet and Red & White Fleet trips around the bay (and Alcatraz Island). Besides, she said that it looks like visiting a nasty old prison.   The big benefit of Alcatraz as a federal prison was that it was essentially a Bay Area version of Guantanamo. I suppose that it would be a great spot to keep high profile terrorists in America. You're not going to escape. However, I suppose that Guantanamo is already designed for that purpose.",chrismireya,2025-05-05T11:02:34,-16
"I'm pretty certain that's what he's implying. Knowing how Trump works, he wouldn't actually bring that prison back due to its historical nature, but rather build a new prison with the same intent, but with modern features.",theboss2461,2025-05-05T10:06:39,-79
"They are escaping prison, but not in the same manner. Before, people actually got locked up in a prison in order to escape it. Today they just ask a liberal judge to go easy on them and then they have no sentence, and are never put in prison in the first place.",theboss2461,2025-05-05T09:58:21,-93
"I think he’s just making a point to open a new super-max prison that is next to impossible to escape and deadly to anyone who tries, even if they managed to get outside the walls/fences.  A new “Alcatraz”.",ITrCool,2025-05-05T09:33:06,-17
It doesn't have to be inland. There are plenty of small islands available.,theboss2461,2025-05-05T11:20:58,-5
"I don't know what the inmate population is, but I live in the Sonoran Desert and there's both a State (AZ) and a Federal Correctional facility not too far from me.  If they aren't full....",tengris22,2025-05-05T16:46:23,-1
"That seems fitting, because the end consumer is allowed to tear off that tag. That label only applies to the manufacturer/retailer.   Filing a lawsuit for violating a rule that doesn't apply to him? Yeah, sounds exactly like something the left would do.",theboss2461,2025-05-05T11:22:39,3
Lawsuits need to be answered by government taxpayer paid lawyers.  I'd rather my money not be wasted frivolously.,SeemoarAlpha,2025-05-05T09:47:06,59

"Why alcatraz, what makes that space so special compared to any other prison?",Dutchtdk,2025-05-05T09:54:42,45
Pam Blondie did say that the gangs wouldn’t be able to run their operations from a place like Alcatraz,whicky1978,2025-05-05T20:45:44,-1
Then he should just say that instead of stirring up shit talking about reopening Alcatraz.,bw2082,2025-05-05T08:52:17,242
We have prisons better though? I think the IDEA of alcatraz is appealing because he thinks that because it's surrounded by water it's a better prison. Someone needs to show him how supermax prisons work.,mojo276,2025-05-05T09:31:06,1
"Gitmo is ready and waiting, designed for the same purpose as Alcatraz. We should put it to use.",social_dinosaur,2025-05-05T10:16:55,-9
"Because this one was in movies, or something.",LemartesIX,2025-05-05T09:57:21,57
Because of the type of people who were sent there. We need a special prison for the worst types of criminals.,theboss2461,2025-05-05T09:56:13,-13
We are going to build Zartacla.  A new and exemplary type of prison.  Same setup as Alcatraz and in the same location.   But different.,aracheb,2025-05-05T09:52:05,36

Who?    Edit:   Let me rephrase.   Who of them escaped prison in the last 30 or so years,Dutchtdk,2025-05-05T09:58:13,42
