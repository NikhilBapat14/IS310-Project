"Goddammit Mitch. The least you could do is show the hell up. Wants all the credit for being ""vocal"" but none of the pushback for actually voting. He'd have rolled up with more medical devices than Vladamir Harkonnen if Kamala was president and they were voting to defund cancer research.

"As much as I hope you are right, the senate is so horribly disadvantageous for Democrats that even if Trump is at 20% favorability, it would be far from certain.  We have three Democratic senators in plausible Republican pickups that are retiring (Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire).  Then we also have to defend Georgia.  And if we do all of that, due to Vance we still need to pickup four seats for the smallest possible majority.  Which means winning Maine \*and\* North Carolina, \*plus\* two of Florida, Ohio, Iowa, Texas, or Alaska.  I'm not saying it's impossible; I'm saying it's going to take more than an unpopular president. We need a strongly-Democratic national environment, plus recruiting seven great candidates, plus actually having remotely-fair elections at all.",MadContrabassoonist,2025-04-30T18:56:05,8

"I agree!  Historically, U.S. citizens have always voted with their wallets which is why Trump won instead of Harris, as voters blamed Biden and the democrats for inflation.   If the economy turns south with jobs loses and inflation, I have no doubt that Democrats could flip the Senate. What I read is that 33 Senate seats are up for re-election.",RealisticForYou,2025-04-30T20:01:01,2

"Every one of them as guilty as Trump. Even worse since he is obviously a toddler destroying our countries reputation, economy, military preparedness and soft power.

"There's no such thing as a plausible Republican pick up in 2026. Democrats aren't losing a single seat and eight GOP seats are in play. Three are going to the democrats and I'm calling that right now, Collins, Ernst and Tillis will lose. One more seat to flip the senate and Kansas, Ohio, Montana and Texas are all going to be in play.   This is exactly like 2006, everyone was saying the democrats will take the house but not the senate because they didn't understand the mood of the nation and the anger at Bush and the Iraq War. The democrats ended up taking both and they will do it again 20 years to the day later.",Prestigious-Ad54,2025-05-01T14:52:46,1

Yeah that‚Äôs my point.  By just skipping the vote it means he doesn‚Äôt have to be on record.  It makes him a spineless coward but we already knew that.,funguy07,2025-05-01T09:32:27,2

"I love the spirit, but the certainty is unwarranted.  The Senate is a dated, undemocratic institution that rewards land over people, and with the current urban-rural divide is going to be a slog for Democrats even in the absolute best of years.  We have 8 races we have to win (most in states Harris didn't win), 7 of which we won't have an incumbent.  That's 7 opportunities for a fumble with some nationally-untested candidate, plus multiple opportunities for Republican state governments to fuck with the election.      We can do it but we need clear-eyed resolve, not blind, unearned optimism.",MadContrabassoonist,2025-05-01T15:28:09,1
