I have no idea how the Donald is considered authentic.  He's nothing but a veneer of supposed power. He's a bully who's too stupid to know who he is.,anti-torque,2025-03-23T22:04:03,22
"Some people have charisma, some don't.  Some people can learn to acquire it, others do not or never realize that they should.  Bill Clinton and Barack Obama had it.  Biden sort of had it in 2020, but then managed to lose it.  Other Democrats in the last few decades lacked it and lost elections because of it.  There are variations of charisma.  Trump has a certain kind of charisma that is enormously appealing to some but greatly offputting to others.  The features that make him charismatic to his fans are also unappealing to his detractors.  Democrats are more dependent upon charisma because they have to maintain a larger tent.  Republicans can get away with just appealing to grievances, given their narrower audience.",I405CA,2025-03-24T12:53:03,6
"That's a good question. In fact, I would say that this question doesn't just extend to politics, but to different parts of life aswell. What makes a song ""iconic,"" or a person ""charismatic,"" or something/someone ""groundbreaking.""  I'd say Biden is actually quite authentic. He wasn't super turnt like Trump, nor was he as sharp as someone like Obama, but he seemed wise and kind. Witty, but not too mean-spirited. He came off as someone who simply wanted to do his job. Even during the Hunter Biden controversy, where we got those leaked phone calls between him and Hunter, he wasn't talking to him in a ""What the fuck is wrong with you?! How could you do that! Do you know how bad this makes you look?!."" He simply talked him like a father would talk to his son who is having a bad time. When displaying authenticity, you simply display yourself as you would display yourself. A person, more specifically, you.  I'd argue that people don't actually think Trump is ""authentic."" Some people might describe him as that, but i'd say he more ""bombastic"" and I think that is something that is rarely seen in politics. Donald is a TV guy. He knows how to show off for the screen and make good television. That's why he makes and does outlandish shit all the time. I think this attitude is what pulls a lot people towards him and even gives him the appearance of being ""authentic.""",Ayy_Teamo,2025-03-26T02:52:49,3
"In your example I would say you mentioned politics who seem to believe what they say (more of the time) vs those who do not seem to believe what they say.  So Trump may say awful things, but it tends to be what is in his head, without a filter. Bernie may be dead wrong on economics, but even conservatives can’t say he hasn’t been fighting mostly the same fight as he has from his start in politics.  Barrack I would say it is for being such a wonderful public speaker. Great speaking voice, always sounded bright and funny, and was great at reading from a teleprompter. As opposed to Trump, who is freaking awful on a teleprompter, if you want to see what I am saying watch his unnatural speech this year. When Trump spoke from the teleprompter it was a monotone, when he went off the cuff he sounded better.  Hillary was a capable public speaker but changed what she stood for so often it was hard to believe much of what she said, and Kamala didn’t seem authentic because (imho) she is a terrible public speaker with a poor voice for the mic, and she didn’t really stand for anything but political slogans.",TheMikeyMac13,2025-03-23T23:18:23,7
"To the question about whether politicians are seen as ""authentic"", I think that's mostly a matter of personal views. I found Kamala Harris very authentic. I loved that she was comfortable just laughing in public at things she found funny. I find it very disturbing that we never see Donald Trump laugh. I get that his supporters think ""he tells it like it is"", but I don't think having no filter on his mouth and the incessant lies is ""authentic"", I just see a bloviating jackass. He doesn't know when or how to shut up. I cannot fathom how anybody sees his whipped meringue of a golden comb-over, and the orange crud on his face as anything but the weird mechanizations of a delusional clown. I mean, he looks like a freak, and we have heard him muse about how good looking he thinks he is. How is that level of narcissistic self regard *authentic?* At one of his arrest and arraignments, he reported his own weight as 230lbs. That man does not weigh 230 lbs, but people just accept his vanity as *authentic?*  The perception of authenticity is also subjective to particular circumstances. People talk a lot about Gavin Newsom, usually deriding him for being too ""slick"", seemingly because he's a very organized speaker, wears too much hair product, smiles a lot and wears tailored suits. I can see there is some validity to that. But when he stood onstage next to Ron DeSantis for their debate, he came off as dramatically more real and likable than DeSantis. Part of it was just that Newsom appeared relaxed and comfortable, where DeSantis looked jittery and unsure of himself. Part of it was that Newsome was taller and better looking. But in all, Newsome appeared (to my eye) as much more authentic and sincere than DeSantis and he projected confidence in a way Ron could not.   I think ""authenticity"" is often a function of individual perception and circumstance, rather than an objective metric.",BluesSuedeClues,2025-03-24T08:37:11,2
"@ivicts30     ""However, people don't like Hillary (& Kamala) even though they are highly qualified candidates because they are not authentic.""   I think the public's impression is that these two want to be there just because they want to be there, for whatever those reasons may be. The other people you listed appear to have goals in mind FOR THE PEOPLE WHO THEY REPRESENT.      These other politicians you mentioned have that, coupled with CHARISMA, so the types of people they know they can sway to being among their supporters are people who want to listen to them more than say, Kamala.     This isn't authenticity, it's just knowing how to market oneself. Authenticity is just being honest, and makes you extremely vulnerable. These people are not authentic either. ",Life-Breadfruit-3986,2025-03-28T15:45:27,2
">However, people don't like Hillary (& Kamala) even though they are highly qualified candidates because they are not authentic.  Kamala built her political career in part on pushing hard for gun control including signing onto a brief to the Supreme Court that there is no individual right to *pistols* under the 2nd amendment and that states should have the power to ban them. She then in the primaries for 2020 presidential election brought up she was a gun owner that owned a *pistol* to bypass the hostility pro 2nd amendment voters have against her and did the same thing for the 2024 presidential election despite none of her actual gun policies really changed.  That is so insincere and phony that it insults the intelligence of anyone even remotely informed on that issue. That is just one example of her insincere pandering that makes people accurately view her as inauthentic.  >How do they balance saying politically correct or being diplomatic and speaking up on what they really believe in?  By not suddenly changing positions at the last minute to win an election and actually articulate why they have changed positions.  >How can we apply these secrets/skills to be more authentic in our daily lives as non-politicians?  >How to be more authentic in our lives, such as work, dating, or social settings?

"_One of the best characteristics of those who win US elections is authenticity_     I can't parse this.

"Political polarization and agenda setting are very influential in the people we see as authentic or not unfortunately. We could never distinguish as a whole, rather as an individual because of how we were raised and the way we the political theatre ourselves. of course, this is not always the case but the reason we see a deliberately undebatable difference in which states vote in which way and haven’t been adjusted for decades if not centuries. I think no politician is more “authentic” than the other, it’s just the politician we see as making more contribution and effective  in terms of which the policy we want to see implemented. I think nobody is unpolarized so the polarization of politicians increases along with what member we see fit to solve our problems and view them as the most authentic.",Tough_Confection2568,2025-03-31T01:11:17,1

"Authenticity is a word that describes the social reward and acknowledgement social groups give to somebody who takes a ***social risk*** when expressing their true selves. If there's no risk, they don't say or appear divise at all, then they are still authentic, but we don't acknowledge it – so we usually only use the word when there is risk involved.",mrcsrnne,2025-03-24T04:58:32,6

"So do you agree that one way to see whether politicians are authentic is to see whether they flip flop often right? I guess its hard to determine whether politicians really believe what they say or not. I mean in the end they are politicians for a reason?  Barack I agree is a great public speaker, but people feel that he believes what he said compare to hillary in 08. Also, you forget michelle.. michelle flats out said she doesnt like politics which is a pretty rare thing for politicians' wives to say hahah. But Barack does flip flop as well sometimes for issues like gay marriage.   The lesson from this is changing policies to be poll tested won't make you win an election I guess. In the end, votters can somehow detect your authenticity and saying what you believe even when its not popular may win you more votes than conforming to poll tested policies. Seems like authenticity might be more important than the specific policies in itself.",ivicts30,2025-03-24T00:53:21,2

Saying what you want when you want isn't authenticity. It's self-entitlement. Saying things that have nothing to do with reality is called lying--anything but authenticity. Doing things which get one convicted of fraud by a jury of their peers is also an indication he's a fraud--also the opposite of authenticity.

"There's a difference between ""flip flopping"" and a change or evolution in a position. Obama gave a very cogent speech about exactly what train of thought led him to change his position on gay marriage. Contrast this with Donald Trump, who will openly take a position in direct contrast to a position he has advocated for years, with seemingly no reason, logic or explanation. He went from habitually denigrating electric vehicles, to selling them on the White House South Lawn.   For Obama, changing his position and explaining why, was somehow viewed with suspicion and anger. For Trump, nobody seems to care that he's contradicting his own strongly voiced position.   I suspect Trump gets away with this, because he has been doing it so habitually, for so long, on everything from guns, to abortion, that his supporters can cherry pick where he voices the position they want to hear, and ignore when he says something else. He can hold all positions, at all times, without them seeing the contradictions. They see what they want to see.",BluesSuedeClues,2025-03-24T08:33:17,2
"> but Obama also flip flop sometimes.. I remember the gay marriage one when he was running in 2008 he didnt support it fully, then it changed in 2012.   You mean when he was in his 2nd term and it had no political cost? Yeah that isn't authentic and shows there were political considerations to it. But one thing doesn't necessarily a pattern make. Harris has a long career of doing it. Hell the example I invoked happened multiple times where she did it during the primaries and then did it during the presidential run while her positions didn't actually change.
