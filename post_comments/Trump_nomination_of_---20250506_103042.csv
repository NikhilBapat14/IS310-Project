"I'd bet good money that Tillis votes for Martin. This is the new GOP playbook - claim uncertainty/unease, then vote yes.",PeterVenkmanIII,2025-05-06T10:33:50,7
Trump will lose his shit over this one. He really wanted Martin and spent political capital to get him this far.,Starks,2025-05-06T10:36:36,6
">Tillis’ decision is likely to doom Martin’s hope of his nomination even being reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee, of which Tillis is a member.  >With Tillis as a “no” vote, the best that Martin could hope for from that committee is a tie vote of 11-11, with Republicans and Democrats evenly split. A tie vote fails to report out a nomination.  This one might actually be meaningful for once, so long as he stands by it as opposed to doing some dumb ""I oppose him but believe it deserves a full floor vote"" thing that they sometimes do.  >“If Mr. Martin were being put forth as a US Attorney for any district except the district where January 6 happened, the protest happened, I’d probably support him, but not in this district.”  Sounds like he'd pretty easily support him elsewhere though, which isn't a great sign.",redpoemage,2025-05-06T10:33:32,3

He wouldn’t make a public statement like this if he was going to support him in the end.,Capable-Ad8541,2025-05-07T02:55:42,1
