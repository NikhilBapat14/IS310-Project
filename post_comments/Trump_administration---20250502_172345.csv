Janet Mills was never on my radar before this but she stuck to her guns and got them to back down. She showed a lot of courage,Bakingsquared80,2025-05-02T20:48:18,26

"Trump is a bully and needs to be handled that way, if she had just backed down he would have kept hitting harder.  They are afraid of having officials take the stand to defend the indefensible.",MyStoopidStuff,2025-05-02T21:47:42,9

It’s so bizarre. So many Mainers hate Janet Mills and support Trump with their whole chest. It’s embarrassing as a human with empathy and kindness for others.,Mor_Ericks28,2025-05-02T21:41:07,3
Why more people and organizations don't stand up to Trump I'll never understand. Trump is a typical bully who will back down when challenged.,QueenChocolate123,2025-05-02T22:31:08,3

Glad to see this. See you in court should be everyone’s response to any of trumps declarations.,pairadimesifted,2025-05-03T06:57:38,1

"I'm glad to see Democrats who will fight and not give in to the pressure to throw x, y or z people under the bus. Yes he wants to be a dictator and disappears people he can demonize, but don't see him as a monster with no ability to yield. See him for what he is, a dumb, delusion, senile, narcissistic old con man who got where is through nepotism and hate and regularly shits himself in public.",Grace_of_Talamh,2025-05-02T22:19:11,9

"I should also answer the question Soggy Train asked. Yes, it amazing to her stand up to his bullshit head on. She didn't run away or throw trans kids under the bus like Gavin Newsom did. She put herself on my radar by showing her will to fight.",Grace_of_Talamh,2025-05-03T03:02:18,5
