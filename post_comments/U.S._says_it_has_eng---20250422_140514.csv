"The Trump administration said in documents filed in federal court Tuesday that it has engaged in “appropriate diplomatic discussions” with El Salvador concerning Kilmar Abrego García, the Maryland resident who was illegally deported to the Central American country last month and is still being held in prison there.  What “appropriate diplomatic discussions” meant, however, was not made clear in the Justice Department document, which was filed during a discovery process now underway after an appeals court excoriated the administration for its apparent lack of effort to abide by a U.S. district court judge’s orders to facilitate Abrego García’s return. On Tuesday, the State Department declined to offer any details.  “We do not comment on private-diplomatic discussions and have nothing to share at this time,” a State Department spokesperson said in a statement.

"Trump is backing down while trying to save face.  It will be the State Department and diplomats in El Salvador who decided to send him back to the US, not Trump.

Trump will be only too happy to sacrifice him - he's got Witkoff, Kellogg, Waltz, a bunch of understudies paired up w him and ready to step in.  Trump figures he gets more popular every time his felon team flouts the law.  And Trump never liked Lil Marco to begin with: not when he ran against him, and not when he considered letting Ivanka challenge his Senate seat.

"They were basically doing this from the word go.  In the meeting at the WH with Bukele, Bukele basically said:  'I can't smuggle a terrorist (Garcia) into the US.""  and the US essentially said, 'If Bukele won't release him then we can't make him.'    Clearly this was a circular argument where both sides were deflecting blame to the other without actually coming together to say, 'How can we get this done?!'",WhatRUHourly,2025-04-22T14:49:55,11

If they’re gonna claim that they aren’t able to get him back. Then they’ve proved that deporting anyone there isn’t tenable as they’ve shown they aren’t actually in control of the process. So if he doesn’t come back then “fine”. But no one else goes.,SteamerTheBeemer,2025-04-22T14:52:18,2
"You know that situation where someone invites you over to hang out but you don't really want to go, so you just put the phone down for like five minutes and then pick it up and tell the person, ""Aw man.

They say there were discussions.  They didn't say there needs to be constructive or progressing or anything like that.  Technically giving each other giant middle fingers over Zoom can be considered discussion.,thieh,2025-04-22T14:10:35,3
"Technically, the Trump admin probably doesn't even have to bring him back.  He had an order of deportation, but a stay from being deported to El Salvador.  That means, to my understanding, that he could be deported to anywhere without a further court order as long as that place was not El Salvador.  To be sent to El Salvador, the admin would need to return to court and prove that the circumstances in which the stay was granted no longer apply.  They didn't do that step and that is how/why he was denied due process.  However, this doesn't prevent them from sending him to, for instance, Venezuela without further hearing.  So, it would not surprise me to hear that the Trump admin took him and then just sent him directly to another country to be deported.  Alternatively, I guess they could bring him back to the US and incarcerate him where they would argue at a bond hearing once again that he's a member of MS13 and a danger to the community and cannot be released.  Then they'd expedite a hearing to prove that the situation in El Salvador has changed and the court might lift his stay and they send him right back to CECOT.  Of course, the horrible part of this is that anyone can just be sent to a maximum security prison/death camp despite their only crime being coming to a country without documentation in an attempt to have a better and safer life.",WhatRUHourly,2025-04-22T14:55:12,2
