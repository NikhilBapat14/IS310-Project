Not so much in the sense of thinking all investigated people should be punished (though many do seem to think that), but in seeing the investigation *itself* as being inherently punitive.

"> The ""results"" and ""data"" are made up bullshit with zero real world implications or usefulness.  Former Counterintelligence officer chiming in. I was not a polygrapher, but I worked with some very good ones in the course of doing various investigations or source verification ops.  Polygraphs are absolutely BS when it comes to ""This machine knows you are lying."" What they really are is an often-times effective interrogation tool that relies on what is called the ""We Know All"" approach (as well as some Fear Up).   Usually the most effective part of the polygraph process is the pre-poly interview. It's basically presented as an opportunity to ""come clean."" A surprising number of people will confess to shit before the machine even gets turned on. In fairness, by the time we were using the poly, it was because we already had a pretty good idea what had happened, and I think the suspects often knew that we had a pretty good idea what happened.  If it gets to the actual poly stage, a skilled interrogator can use that machine to convince the subject that they are picking up on deception. Most people are bad liars under normal circumstances, and then you add in the pressures of the polygraph -- a strange room, all these wires and shit hanging off you, the interrogator making little comments like ""You're sweating a lot, so we need to see if you can calm down"" -- all these things put stress on the system and make it harder for the subject to keep up the act.  All of that is to say: polygraphs definitely do NOT work like the way you see on TV, but they absolutely have some good usefulness in the hands of people who know what they are doing.",WHSRWizard,2025-04-25T08:40:13,3

"Theyre useless. Theyre just stage performances. Usually what gets you is the written questions before hand that you submit then take the polygraph and they check what you say to what you wrote and if something is off they will mark it as suspicious. Otherwise, they buddy you up then leave it hooked on and tell you to relax and chat trying to get you to say something then you start the test. After the second round they tell you to sit outside or something to think about your responses and then you come back in and they say they or the boss is upset. They dont like what theyre seeing, wont you reconsider and be their hero-collaborator? You say no, they grumble and threaten and test you again. Then they‚Äôll say that you‚Äôre going to fail unless you come clean aka incriminate yourself. If you do they can you if you dont more grumbling and then its over. They honestly have no way of telling if youre lying or not. Its also funny that at the beginning theyll tell you how bullet proof the test is and then ask you to sign a waiver about never having done biofeedback or transcendental meditation.",Golden-Frog-Time,2025-04-25T08:28:27,2

"To the first point I‚Äôll clarify;  Hegseth at the end of his career served in the billet of a Major, however did not complete the requisites to retain the rank. On paper, he was a Captain. However, the rank is separate from the level of leadership experience.  The highest level of leadership experience he ever held was leading a platoon sized element as a lieutenant. Following that, his career was mostly being thrown into busy work to keep him out of the way and out of trouble. (He was an infantry platoon leader for a time. Then it appears he was tasked at the S-9 (Civil Affairs) which is used as a throwaway shop when you‚Äôre not in an actual CA unit. Then he volunteered to teach COIN in Kabul for a single class despite no COIN experience. After that was IRR.) So he had no development on strategic level management.  Which goes to your other point, that I discussed already;  > Even civilians who have taken on the SecDef role traditionally have a plethora of organizational and strategic level leadership experience prior to assuming the mantle.  Civilians who‚Äôve held the title of SecDef, or even prior enlisted, usually have; corporate level leadership experience (CEO, COO), national policy experience, or a combination.",TheFizzex,2025-04-25T08:51:16,5
