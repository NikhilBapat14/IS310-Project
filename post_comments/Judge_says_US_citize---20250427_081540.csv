Father is illegal too. Cops were like ""Come pick her but we can't pretend we didn't see you"" because there is stuff to be signed. So he is likely on the 'list' to be sent back soon.

"We are orders of magnitude apart. The woman wasn’t allowed to talk to a lawyer. She wasn’t allowed to talk to the father of her children. Her AMERICAN children were deported without due process.

You don’t get to go “agree man” after arguing with me this whole time.   Also this is the Trump you are defending. He literally is saying no due process  https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/s/rM36ecFjmm,Jdmaki1996,2025-04-27T14:50:25,4
"If he had legal status and Custody. Why would he not pick the girl up from ICE? I agree, Trump should appointment a lot more judges to oversee these removals, so the proces can be quick and efficient. Right now it's not. The immigration system is a disaster from all the illegal migrants let into the country. If everyone was turned away at the border, then this would not have become such a large problem. Those people could have applied legally to immigrate to the US. Instead they tried the illegal route, which is the one it seems preferred by the left. The vast majority or economic migrant, as such they can do it the legal way and wait in line.",ComfortableAcadia252,2025-04-27T14:22:42,0

"Oh you're back. I'm not even TALKING ABOUT THAT. You're changing what I'm talking about to what YOU want to talk about because you said something untrue. I'm just saying that the dad was trying to get custody of the child to his sister in law and that there's reasons why.  >The lady gave birth to that child and has raised her for 2 years, it's HER KID.  It's THEIR kid, but that has NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT I'VE BEEN SAYING. Which goes back to you saying he doesn't want the kid, that's an INCORRECT statement if he's trying to keep the kid in the family.

"I mean even if someone legally was in immigrant, they can still get deported in this admin. Which is why due process is important.  >If he had legal status and Custody  No, it's if he had custody. Period. She cannot remove the child without an agreement, which is why it goes to the courts, if he has a guardian that can take his child, then he should be able to with agreement with the mom, he was never able to.  This all literally comes down to GOING TO COURT to legally do this. The child was a legal immigrant, she was illegal, does not allow her to take the legal immigrant without a court hearing.",AussieP1E,2025-04-27T14:35:12,2

""However, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agent spoke to a family attorney and ""refused to honour the request"" and said that the ""father could try to pick her up, but that he would also be taken into custody"".
