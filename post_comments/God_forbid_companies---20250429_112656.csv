"Facts are this regime‚Äôs enemy. It‚Äôs no different than for any other authoritarian regime. Facts are always the enemy.  ‚ÄúHostile and political‚Äù is the phrase they are currently using to describe companies telling the truth about tariffs. Eventually, I expect that phrase to become ‚Äúenemies of the state.‚Äù  Wikipedia, schools in general, higher education, libraries, even books‚Ä¶ facts are this regime‚Äôs primary enemy.

I would‚Äôve loved for this to happen.   I would also like to have a full disclosure on where the stuff I buy is coming from.      I would just like it for a different reason than the trumpet administration.  üòâ,bde959,2025-04-29T12:28:39,2
"Trump has to fight this one hard. If the floodgates open on this, it will be REALLY bad for him. Can you imagine if just 10 major retailers did it?  All of us need to decouple our lives from the feds to preserve the freedom to do this stuff without coercion to stop.  Kudos to Amazon if it's true, even if it's only to rattle his cage.

"I find it ironic that in my area there are basically three big grocery stores: Walmart, Kroger, and Albertsons.   All of them will have difficult decisions with what products to buy that are imported and guessing if Americans will pay X tariff on Y good.   All of these companies are based in states with two R senators. The largest of these states is OH.

I think he was in on it. Trump would not have told Levitt to make that threat without talking to Bezos first. No way in Hell. It's a threat to all the other companies. They are supposed to be scared that they will be hunted down and prosecuted.,New_Taste8874,2025-04-29T12:48:02,7

"Because tariffs usually aren‚Äôt blanket-applied to everything.   If you import raw goods like steel or soy beans then tariffs usually show up as a line items.   Most taxes on receipts are separate line items because they are collected on your behalf and companies want you to know exactly how much is outside of their price structure.   If you don‚Äôt like paying XXX extra, call Congress, not the store manager.
