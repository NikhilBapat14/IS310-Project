"Government defiance of court orders and arresting the judiciary is the final straw that broke the camels back.  The rule of law has now been eroded to the point that the US has become , by definition , a dysfunctional failed state.  When governments ignore and attack the judiciary with impunity it means that the system of government has broken down.  When citizens and others , including corporations and investors , cannot trust the legal system or government then it is all over.   A breakdown of trust in institutions is widely accepted as a significant factor in precipitating the fall of the Roman Empire and this now appears to be the case with the USA.",iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-04-26T07:38:25,6

"A short story to answer your question: I was at the capitol on 1/6. That night, as I was leaving the grounds, I saw two things that helped me “get it” (of course that whole day was enough for anybody to get it). After the building had been secured and crowds were dispersed (it was well into the night at this point), a woman nearby was weeping. She was a Trump supporter and she had apparently been in the same area as me. We were both covered in tear gas. The woman was saying, repeatedly, “I can’t believe they got away with it.” Not long after this, heading north, I found a group guys huddled around an iPhone. They were reading Trump’s tweets and I could hear their disappointment that he told them, infamously, it was time to go home.   It’s one thing to break into a building hoping to overturn an election. It’s another thing entirely to still feel cheated when the constitution says no.",[deleted],2025-04-26T02:08:03,4

Reverse psychology is a communication strategy where someone encourages a desired behavior by suggesting the opposite, capitalizing on the natural human tendency to resist being told what to do.  In this case, we start marketing campaigns aimed at Republican leaders and red state residents, claiming that the West Coast and Northeast are extremely poor and violent, and everyone there is on welfare.

"I see Trump’s wonton disregard for the constitution to be something of a trial balloon to see just how far he can push things. At some point I expect that he will declare a state of emergency and push to erode America’s constitutional protections even further. If a manufactured fentanyl crisis is sufficient to slap tariffs on Canada and start a global trade war, finding an excuse to declare martial law shouldn’t be all that difficult.

"Trump might attempt martial law, but I don't see how he'll succeed at it, especially if he's doing it just to cancel elections. Because one, look what happened when the Korean president tried it.  It failed miserably for him.  Two, Trump has endorsed about 20 candidates for 2026 already and will very likely endorse a lot more over time.  I don't see how the candidates that Trump endorsed would be okay with him abolishing the election because you can't endorse candidates only to then turn around and cancel elections.  Why do you think Trump is endorsing candidates if you think he'll declare martial law and cancel elections?  And three, while there's no doubt in my mind that Hegseth will be in favor of martial law if Trump declares it, the military consists of millions of more people than just Hegseth.  I'm sure that at least 98% of the military doesn't want elections to be canceled just as much as the rest of America, including those that support Trump.  If Trump's motive for martial law is to cancel the 2026 election, what makes you believe that everyone in the military would go along with this?",jonasnew,2025-04-26T09:21:06,2
