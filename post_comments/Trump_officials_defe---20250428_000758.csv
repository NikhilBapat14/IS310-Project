the supreme court needs to step in and order for there to be no more deportations by Trump because we are at that point where theres a new insane deportation case every other day along with immigration judges being illegally arrested..  I am starting to lose track of everything.,wizgset27,2025-04-28T01:45:51,4

"See thread above where the mothers wanted the children to remain with other caregivers, but ICE did not give them a choice.   I also want to know what crime the mothers committed. I would prefer murders, rapists, and shoplifters being deported before mothers seeking medical care for their US children. ",ArcBounds,2025-04-28T00:29:33,17
The children had us citizens family members willing to take custody but ice would not allow them any communication. Why are you so interested in being fair to them?,blamethestarsnotme,2025-04-28T00:26:23,13
"I know in at least one of the cases the father apparently is also not a US citizen. ICE said if a 'legal Father' appeared they would let the child go into his custody, but they refused to allow legal residents who were family (not the Father) to take the child into their custody.  They chose to deport the child with the Mother. It was forced. There was no attempt to allow a parent to make other arrangements for where a LEGAL US CITIZEN could stay with family in the US.",Timpa87,2025-04-28T00:44:54,3
they are a fkn US citizen. they should not be told they have to pick between their mom or foster care..,1_churro,2025-04-28T02:22:02,5

They are children. They do what their parents want them to do. They are still citizens.,pickledplumber,2025-04-28T08:41:57,-2
Well what right was deprived? Their parents specifically chose to move them. If the parents abandoned them here they would have gone into foster care. If the parents sent them to live with a relative they would have stayed too. But the parents decided to bring the children. The parents not only decided to bring the children. But they failed to prepare for this very occasion. Why weren't precautions set for such an event.   i fail to see how the child's rights were deprived?,pickledplumber,2025-04-28T00:59:38,-10
