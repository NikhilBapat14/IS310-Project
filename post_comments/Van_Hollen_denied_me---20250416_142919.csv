"I know trump pulled out of the ICC but that does not mean they cannot condemn him. A human rights complaint should be filed by every applicable  international organization.

How do we know if he is still alive?  El Salvador says that they are keeping him because the US is paying them.  Where is the proof of life or are they just accepting the payments and pretending.

One judge is already starting the process to make them sit down for depositions about it. They have until the 23rd of this month to do so and then the judge will decide from there whether they will be held in contempt.
