Helplessness is contagious. Make calls. Write letters. Donate. Protest. Keep fighting. And don't let despair spread.,NebuchadnezzarIV,2025-04-30T20:46:29,60

"Exactly. They want us to give up. They want us to go ""well I guess this is just how it is from now on"" and comply through our passiveness. The holocaust happened this way. People sticking their heads in the sand about what was right on front of them. We spent 80 years trying to remind people that this should never happen again and here we are, at the beginning of said thing happening again. So, what's it gonna be? Are you going to be passive or are you going to fight?",331845739494,2025-05-01T05:18:58,11
