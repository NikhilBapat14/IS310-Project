"**Summary**:  The Trump administration aims to strip collective bargaining rights from over 1 million federal workers via an executive order, citing national security. Unions argue this is a broader attack on labor rights and have sued to block it. Legal battles may reach the Supreme Court, with unions warning of severe consequences for worker protections. A federal judge has temporarily blocked the order. Critics call it union-busting and an authoritarian power grab.",pharrt,2025-05-01T06:07:23,5

Of course. Fascists don't like unions. Or anything else that can make them lose control or serve as an alternative nexus of political power.,barryvm,2025-05-01T08:25:34,1
