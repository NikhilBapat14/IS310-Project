"Shooting his load at the global economy and expecting grovelling , speedy one-sided trade deals is the height of stupidity.   Trade deals are the result of extremely complex negotiations and can take years but Trump in his arrogant dumbness seems to think otherwise.  He does not have any threats left in his pocket and this trade war is so vast and wide ranging that it is unsustainable and tariffed nations are fully aware of this.  Nations will sit back and wait for it to crumble , especially China , as they draw down on US bonds to bolster economies and this has the effect of sinking the USD.  Inflationary tariffs will become exacerbated by the reduced buying power of a sinking USD and is punishing the US economy. As bonds are jettisoned and the USD slides it edges the nation closer to default.",iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-05-06T18:58:23,3
