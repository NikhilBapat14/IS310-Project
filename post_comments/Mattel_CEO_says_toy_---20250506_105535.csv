No shit. Why would they build new factories in here when everything they would build the factories and the products out of will be facing tariffs? And then they would be facing tariffs shipping overseas.  Meanwhile if they build overseas they face tariffs shipping to the United States but none between most other countries.

We were doing a lot of the toy battery operated cars.  They wanted the molds so cheap, we could not do it.  Every now and then they throw me a flyer to quote the work.  The cost delta is farther now than it was 30 years ago.  A toy jeep that they sell for $250, they told if they had to use Canadian/American molds, the jeeps would cost $750-$1000.  Production for assembly could come back to USA for minimum wage jobs but the design and mold building would never come back and thats where the skill lies and unfortunately, all that skill is now in Asia.",photon1701d,2025-05-06T12:33:03,12

"Yup. The USMCA was started by Trump, hailed as a beautiful trade agreement by Trump, and then a few years later torn up by Trump.   Business doesn’t necessarily care about ethics but they do care about consistency. Manufacturing location and the part supply chain and logistics around it are things that get planned and budgeted for years in advance. When you can’t trust trade agreements to last until the ink gets dry, you can’t make those countries part of your plans.   And of course the worst part of all of this is that after this is all said and done and Trump leaves office and MAGA loses power (whenever and however that occurs), those decisions will have already been made. Companies and countries will have planned around the USA rather than with us, and they aren’t going to come back just because we show that we can build a sane government ~50% of the time.",kung-fu_hippy,2025-05-06T16:41:41,36

The interesting question is what the US is going to have to give up to other nations to see tariffs lowered again.  Within 6 months the US will be forced to remove their tariffs to see shelves restocked and the rush to recession halted; but all those reciprocal tariffs put in place around the world - they are going to need an inducement to open their markets to US goods again.

My little sister even though making a great salary and living a comfortable life consistently lives with anxiety that any minor emergency will wipe them out, even though she's prepared financially for them. Me, I have a hard time NOT spoiling my kids because there was so many times I had to do without as a child as the oldest that I never want that for them even a little, my wife has to pull me back. She lived a very middle class childhood whereas I did not. My little brother spends money on himself EXTREMELY begrudgingly because he's worried that he'll need the money another time.

Yes they shielded us from knowing hard times, but not from life. They encouraged us to help others. We grew up volunteering and helping our community. I haven't done much recently but I still donate to organizations like Toys for Tots and the like. A lot of of that has been lost in recent years and that is a shame.
