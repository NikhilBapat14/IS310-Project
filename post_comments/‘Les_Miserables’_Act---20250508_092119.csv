"Good on them. I don't know what Trump was thinking taking over the Kennedy Center, other than he wanted to suppress arts that had to do with LGBTQ+ and race related material. Performing arts is the field most likely to be progressive and oppose his agenda. These performers are fantastic. Trump can take over the Kennedy Center, gut our democracy, stamp on the rights of immigrants, but he can't make them sing and dance for him.",PoetryJunior1808,2025-05-08T09:35:13,209

It’d be hilarious if it just turned into a one man reiteration of Les Mis just for Trump… he’s so out of touch from reality I doubt he’ll know what’s the story of Les Mis,Particular-Ad-3411,2025-05-08T10:23:15,25

"Well, it’s not like Dingus was going to stay awake for the whole thing anyway. Les Mis requires thought and empathy and imagination; Trump would get bored and start texting how bread thieves should get the death penalty or some shit.",Galliagamer,2025-05-08T12:30:19,8

"“*Any performer who isn’t professional enough to perform for patrons of all backgrounds, regardless of political affiliation, won’t be welcomed. In fact, we think it would be important to out those vapid and intolerant artists to ensure producers know who they shouldn’t hire – and that the public knows which shows have political litmus tests to sit in the audience. The Kennedy Center wants to be a place where people of all political stripes sit next to each other and never ask who someone voted for but instead enjoys a performance together.*”     On the contrary, Mr. Grennell, now we know which cast members and performers to support and hire.  Go fuck yourself and the sanctimony you rode in on; artists are not your slaves!",allenahansen,2025-05-08T17:23:33,5
I refuse to believe that Trump would sit through an entire production of Les Miserables. That man is not sitting through 3hrs,DrWernerKlopek89,2025-05-08T14:22:09,5

"Better than announcing that they are refusing to participate so that producers have time to replace them before the show, they should attend rehearsal, dress for the show, then announce their refusal to participate once POTUS is in his seat so that he actually has to experience being boycotted",n-harmonics,2025-05-08T15:32:31,2
"What if the Les Miserables actors were instead baking cakes in a bakery, and Donald Trump was a gay couple wanting a wedding cake.  Would the Maga crowd be ok with them refusing?",WardenEdgewise,2025-05-08T23:37:00,2

"It’s tough to know when Trump is listening to his narcissism, being motivated by hatred, or just being stupid.",Electromotivation,2025-05-08T09:50:40,48
"Apparently Trump just genuinely loves the theatre, but his father thought it was “gay” and would bully him over it. He’s had multiple failed attempts at producing plays over the years.",BDMac2,2025-05-08T11:59:00,18
I assumed it was a society type thing that he was largely unwelcome at so he needed to flap his fat cheeks on top to mark it as his,SillyGoatGruff,2025-05-08T11:53:40,10
"A lot of people also probably were able to make a living as actors and artists because of federal grants through the National Endowment of the Arts, which is now being sunk to make a minor dent on a spreadsheet.

"Story time: I did community theater and the lady I did Music Man with back in 2013 ended up at the Capitol on Jan 6, she’s the “tell Nancy Pelosi we’re coming for her” asshole. Everyone who did the show wasn’t surprised because she was a conservative asshat then who told a gay teenager in the cast she didn’t believe in gay marriage  Just something I think about from how fucking ironic it is to hate gay people but do an art form propped up by LGBTQ+ creators. I ended up quitting that theater eventually after I myself came out and began my true life",IniMiney,2025-05-08T21:34:25,2

"What's weird is it's reportedly one of his favorites? I read that he also used one of the songs for his campaign, not sure which it when.    I don't get it, personally. Maybe he likes the idea of locking up someone for 2 decades for stealing bread? I could see that being his main take away",3qtpint,2025-05-08T13:27:03,12

"I would bet that Trump sees himself as Jean Valjean, a persecuted hero who's built an empire from nothing, who is only trying to better himself and the people around him.    Trump is a massive narcissist with no self-awareness and a persecution complex.",samsqanch,2025-05-08T17:21:19,13
