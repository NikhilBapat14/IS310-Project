"In other news, yeah, we fucking told you. The best outcome was them just wanting land they'd already occupied and have kept. That's why you don't negotiate with them.",2_Spicy_2_Impeach,2025-05-08T18:28:32,9
It hasn’t “won” shit. It has stolen land and slaughtered women and children to do so.,KenUsimi,2025-05-08T21:40:10,8

This isnt the 1800s we don't reward illegal wars of territorial aggression,haroldthehampster,2025-05-08T19:11:46,1

"This is exactly the same thinking at work in Syria where Isreal invaded Golan heights in 1967 and then illegally (according to international law) annexed 2/3 of it in 1981. In 2024, they occupied the remaining 1/3. With the unwavering support of the US. We can guess how this UKR/RUS process will go.",AcceptableSwim8334,2025-05-08T19:00:27,1
"Honestly, I'm not Ukrainian, but I always thought giving up Crimea and getting everything back in ""Proper Ukraine"" was a solid deal.",abraksis747,2025-05-08T18:44:41,-5
"“Russia can’t expect to be given territory that they haven’t even conquered yet,” Vance told Fox News.  So yeah, he's ok with the word ""conquered"" too. Like this is feudal times.",xMagnis,2025-05-08T18:39:51,42
Vile to be sure but worse I doubt they feel the opposite about Ukraine's foothold in Kursk.,No_Anxiety285,2025-05-08T18:50:22,2
So Ukraine did have cards,Overweighover,2025-05-08T19:05:22,2
"they have reasons. horeshit reasons, but still reasons:  - Russians are the slavviest of the slavs and therefore have a right to rule over all other slavs.  - Ukraine wants to join the EU and NATO and that hurts Putin's feelings.  - Lots of resources and arable land.",RichardSaunders,2025-05-09T03:51:00,2
The drones will have the final say. And they don't seem to agree with Vancetrump so far.,LocalStatistician538,2025-05-08T19:24:40,1
But occupying it is a reflection of their victory.  I’d say this is more like Gaza claiming that parts of Israel are actually Palestine however the Palestinians have never won these territories.  Oct 7 was an invasion but they captured no land.,dbag3o1,2025-05-08T19:58:52,3
I guess we should just give up Southern California and Texas to South America then.,PhantomCowgirl,2025-05-08T18:56:05,5

He's post fucking stupid  Russia should get 0 land.  They should lose shit for being so evil and all the destruction they have caused to Ukraine.  The 40 million lives destroyed cause of him.,ProtonPi314,2025-05-08T20:45:32,6
"> So yeah, he's ok with the word ""conquered"" too. Like this is feudal times.  Like it or not, they're both incredibly valid words to use in this situation.",Ouija_ghosted_me,2025-05-08T18:41:59,-2
While all true I think the main reason is just like Donnie Putin wants the 80s back. They are both nostalgic of a time for them that meant good things for them with no repercussions.,ianrl337,2025-05-09T10:00:30,1
"You are right about this example, I was more reflecting upon the idea that this US administration believes sustained  military occupation _alone_ entitles a permanent claim over the land, regardless of international rules around sovereign territory. This should be a significant warning to Denmark and Canada.",AcceptableSwim8334,2025-05-08T20:10:20,1

How about just outright stolen?,Louis_Ziffer,2025-05-09T05:46:04,1
Occupy would be the correct word to use.,Purify5,2025-05-08T18:51:55,10
"It's certainly possible that Russia is occupying certain territory. They may have currently won a battle over it, but as long as Ukraine still wants it back then they haven't won the war, nor is it conquered.  Who is Vance to stand there and say 'it's all done, I'm happy, Russia won'.",xMagnis,2025-05-08T18:56:20,2

Yea we all signed treaties not to do that shit and it held until techbros started romanticizing feudalism,haroldthehampster,2025-05-08T19:13:58,7
"They have similar meanings but occupy considers settlement as a way of taking control of a land while conquering is just taking control through military action. And, Russia is pouring settlers into the area.  Occupy is the correct word in this situation. JD Vance just isn't allowed to say it because Israel doesn't like the word.",Purify5,2025-05-08T19:04:14,1
"Ok fine. Russia **is** occupying certain territory in Ukraine.  It's still not up to VP Vance to claim game over.  Unless there's some kind of signed treaty document, including all parties. I haven't heard of one.",xMagnis,2025-05-08T19:10:54,2
