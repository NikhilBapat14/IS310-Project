"Well that right there is exactly why it'll be a civil war not a Hitler regime. To well armed, some militias are trained well, unfortunately most of them are right wing nut jobs. Infighting and government fights. Civil war (2024) was prophetic. They cannot initiate martial law so easily without bombing their own citizens. Plenty of soldiers wouldn't stand for it, cops, etc. Also the countryside is to huge they'd need to focus a few cities but the numbers alone and lack of guerilla warfare on their part, paired with lack of knowledge of the area wouldn't lend them favors once mobilization is on the opposition. Civil war is my biggest thought on what's gonna happen, because no way in fuck are me and most Americans into Peter thiels stupid city states ideas. They can't even implement it anywhere, it's why they want Greenland they couldn't get praxis going. It'll be fight after fight after fight and it's going to get rough and bloody like a bar room birth in a rundown men's room stall with no A/C and achey breaky heart is stuck on repeat on that damn jukebox while you grip a toilet bowl with a finger in shit.

"You severely overestimate what Japans ambitions were, they wanted a solidified far east, they didn’t care at all about our land since they knew they could never hold it. The main issue was the logistics of getting soldiers that far anyways, not that we had civilians with guns. Effectively moving large armies 5000+ miles across oceans wasn’t a realistic thing back then. We also had twice the number of people split over many, many times the landmass that wouldn’t have been feasible to control with the size of the Japanese Army.  Japan never actually invaded Hawaii despite having the capability to after they attacked Pearl Harbor, which should easily show what their intentions were in the war. A vast majority of their forces were focused on Asia and they needed us to not interfere. Mainland US is so far outside their sphere of influence it wouldn’t have actually been thought of as a realistic target, nothing to do with rednecks with guns defending it.

"I hear you, but for the record (if you’re talking US), you as a civilian can absolutely not get a flamethrower easily. What you are most likely referring to (like the Elon “flame thrower”) is actually just a glorified blow torch/weed torch. The distinction being, a flame thrower actually *throws* flaming fuel at a distance. Those weed torches are just big lighters— localized flame burning fuel, with a limited range.   The reason why you can buy one of those *flame throwers* easily is because it was deemed to have a legitimate legal purpose with as limited danger to the public as possible, given the fiery context. The same goes for those “few dollars of gas” — legitimate purpose with as limited dangers as possible.   The reason you can’t get a *real* flamethrower easily (there are certain contexts under which a civilian can own one, like for controlled burns by forestry services) is because it’s deemed a destructive device — something with little to no legitimate legal purpose (like self defense) and a lot of potential to cause harm.   I get your point that it’s still possible to burn a house down with gas, but as easy as that may be, it’s not flamethrower easy. As discussed we can’t stop people from buying gas. We can stop them from having flamethrowers.   Automatic weapons are not dissimilar in my mind in that regard— little to no legitimate legal purpose that is not already accomplished by the fire arms we already have access to, and far too dangerous in the wrong hands to be worth the upsides. Yes you can still shoot people with a semi-auto, and I personally believe we make that too easy, but if you know anyone who has used automatic weapons, I don’t think they would even argue much about just how big an increase in destructive power full autos are. Differences like 50-60 rounds per min vs. potentially hundreds. I get they’re cool and fun to shoot, but they’re just not worth the trade off to the public in favor of fun range days and perhaps some belief that one day you might have to over throw a dictatorship.",T-homas-paine,2025-05-08T17:51:30,0
"There are zero laws restricting the ownership of a flamethrower in the United States. They are less restricted than firearms, even the really powerful ones. [Here's a website selling them.](https://throwflame.com/)  Machine guns meanwhile are NFA items, and are highly restricted. Not only do I need to go through the same process as getting any other firearm to buy one. I need a background check, can't be a felon, or several other things. Beyond that I need an NFA stamp, which requires a $200 fee, and an enhanced background check. The registry was also closed in 1986, with only guns manufactured and registered prior to that being grandfathered in. So there are a limited number of fully automatic guns available, and you're looking at the low 5 figures minimum to buy one.",CombinationRough8699,2025-05-08T17:59:40,3
"Wow. Touché. I’ll admit I was misinformed on the flame thrower front. In my defense, when this was last discussed in a classroom setting for me was a gov class pre 2015 when this seems to have started to become tested law (according to Wikipedia). Also, states can ban them, although admittedly basically none do (just Maryland really). It’s not a constitutional right like fire arms.   But on the full auto front, I think my point still stands. While I’m not a gun owner myself, I have shot guns with friends and enjoyed doing so. While I don’t personally have the need to own a gun, I can see why someone else would. That said, I really don’t see how any civilian would *need* a full automatic. I know that you can own an full auto with a shit ton of permits and a lot of money to spend on those pre nfa guns, and honestly if those high hurdles stayed that high I’d be fine with that. They’re that high for a reason. I don’t think we should be lowering them.   Now I guess I just wished we had some regs on flamethrowers…",T-homas-paine,2025-05-08T18:24:56,1
