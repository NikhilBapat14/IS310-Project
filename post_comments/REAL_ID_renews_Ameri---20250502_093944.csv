This requirement has been on the horizon for 20 years.   I've lived in four different states and never had an awful experience at any of their DMVs. I showed up with the required documents and had to wait for a bit.,Mountain_Man_88,2025-05-02T09:51:22,54
But we can't require it to vote.  :(,Sengfeng,2025-05-02T10:57:18,25
"I admit that back in the day, going to the DMV (or BMV here in Ohio!) was an ordeal. But the last decade or so, at least here in Ohio, it has been a breeze.  Online check in, I haven't waited more than 10-15 minutes and I am in and out.  I can't speak for every state but do your homework, look online at what documents are required and do online check in.  EDIT:  There is wealth of things you can do online in Ohio - renew your plates, renew your license, schedule exams, etc.  All of these things cut down on lines and wait times.",scully360,2025-05-02T15:12:47,4
My DMV requires appointments now and when you make one the line is actually longer then it was in the past when I showed up randomly.,Hectoriu,2025-05-02T12:31:51,7
"My issue is the age old ""Papers Please"" RealID will be distorted and twisted. The Government will pass more bills that add to what it is for till we no longer have State IDs.   Proof is the Social Security Card, until 1972 it specifically said not to be used as Identification. But they changed it.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-02T10:50:30,13
"Real question here, I don’t travel like at all via plane and I barely leave town in my car. Is real id needed for anything other than flying?",Blales,2025-05-02T15:50:09,2
Real id is another scam,cwino2288,2025-05-02T09:59:44,6
"I never was in the need for one and figured they just cancel it. Im still not planning on needing it anytime soon. Ill just wait till after deadline to get it when it calms dow more. Plus ill be moving states soon, and it makes sense to wait. Im in a major city so dmvs in city were alwys bad. I just go out to suburbs, and its better.",AtomicFox84,2025-05-02T14:45:13,1
you had 20 years to do it,CalmHabit3,2025-05-02T16:25:52,1
"This has been in the works for over 20 years... If you are just now getting around to upgrading then you have blocked to blame but yourself. Most states were smart about it and established deadlines so that only Real IDs were issued after a certain date so that even the folks who put off voluntarily upgrading and waited until their traditional IDs expiration to renew, that they'd still have a real id at renewal BEFORE the deadline. Others have made it optional over the years while recommending people upgrade for this reason.   Some folks are resistant to change and absolutely refuse to do so until the last second... Then want to kick and scream about every small issue while blaming real id for their laziness.   I upgraded mine years ago, I spent the same amount of time in the DMV as I would have getting the old regular ID.",Rocket_Surgery83,2025-05-02T14:22:22,-3
"The DMVs in my area of Louisiana are horrible. It takes 3 hours to even get called if you just show up in the morning, and it took me an hour to get my RealID even with an appointment. When I told my family it only took an hour they were all amazed I could get in and out of the DMV so quickly",Skyrimosity,2025-05-02T11:39:50,13

And not required to fly if you’re an illegal alien,dont-CA-my-TX,2025-05-02T11:56:36,15
I don’t either but it’s one of those things I figure I don’t want to need at some point and have to wait to get it. Kinda like a passport. Which I also don’t have. License is due for renewal next month though so instead of doing it online I’ll just go to the dmv and get it done with,chillthrowaways,2025-05-02T16:20:41,2
