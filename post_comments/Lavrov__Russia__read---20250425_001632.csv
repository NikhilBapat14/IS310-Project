"Yep. This is the perfect opportunity for Trump to enable Russia to restore forces while still achieving part of the main goal to take all of Ukraine. War will be back in 1-2 years and Russia will attempt to take the rest. Or they'll take Moldova or the Baltic countries first, depending on if they believe that Trump can ignore article 5.  Trump is allowing Russia to get up from its knees and build strength to continue it's assault on European nations. Keeping the pressure would've worked, but for some reason (specifically Trump being Putins puppet) Trump chose to re-enable Putins vision for a Russian empire.",Opposite-Orchid5653,2025-04-25T03:04:40,3
