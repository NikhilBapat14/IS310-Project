Race based discrimination is a core tenant of the Democrat philosophy dating back hundreds of years.,RandolphE6,2025-04-25T17:21:45,26
"In a Tuesday interview on the Fox Business Network, McMahon said that states that refuse to sign could “risk some defunding in their districts.” The purpose of the form is “to make sure there’s no discrimination that’s happening in any of the schools,” she said.  When you receive “monies” from the Federal Government, you follow the rules that accompany receiving that money, if you don’t, you lose it, simple!  These states will not win this case.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-25T17:22:33,8
"It truly blows my mind how they still push diversity and affirmative action garbage, and how democrat judges are so accommodating to something that is so blatantly discriminatory and flagrantly illegal.  Title IV of the Civil Rights Act 1964 expressly ""prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, or national origin in federally funded education programs.""  There is NOT a caveat anywhere that says race-based discrimination becomes okay if you purport to have good intentions, or you think you are discriminating for noble reasons. Everyone who has ever discriminated based on race in the history of the planet thinks they are doing the ""right thing"" based on their own warped logic. The language of both the 14th amendment and Civil Rights act are crystal clear. You cannot discriminate based on race, period. There is no provision for exceptions, no DEI carve out, no ""noble intentions"" caveat. There are no exceptions, period. It's clear as can be and the fact that leftist judges are still ruling in favor of allowing racial discrimination despite it being very clearly banned in all circumstances is utter garbage. They should be fired and disbarred, because they are deliberately ignoring the law and simply ruling purely based on what they think is virtuous, which they have no authority to do. Judges job is to enforce existing laws as written, not make up their own laws or pick and choose which laws they agree with. They need to enforce the existing laws whether they personally agree with it or not, and way too many of them refuse to do that. Affirmative action should have been struck down as unconstitutional from the very start, it's not even a grey area or open to interpretation. It's flagrantly, blatantly, and verbatim illegal as written in law. It's an affront to the judiciary that it was allowed to stand for decades.",TheSleepyTruth,2025-04-25T18:39:09,7
"Agree 💯 %❗️👀  >[Wikipedia - Ku Klux Klan]Historian Eric Foner observed: ""In effect, the Klan was a military force **serving the interests of the Democratic party,** the planter class, and all those who desired restoration of white supremacy. Its purposes were political, but political in the broadest sense, for it sought to affect power relations, both public and private, throughout Southern society. ",GiediOne,2025-04-25T18:17:07,4
