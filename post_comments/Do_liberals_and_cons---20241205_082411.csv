">For example, the previous French government was a partnership between the liberal French president and the conservative French Prime Minister. And they were able to create a government without any left-wing socialists and right-wing nationalists.  That's kind of a bad example [because that government just collapsed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/05/what-happens-next-now-france-government-has-fallen-explainer).  And that government was formed that way to prevent the largest party in the government from [having control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_France).  But also to your point, it was the National Rally and Socialists (and others) to take it down.  (Note: French politics is *weird*)  But to the general question - I think even the Left and MAGA have a lot in common but they are too stuck to their means to achieving those goals to realize that they're essentially striving for the same goals.  Take the tariffs that everyone is tearing their hair out about.  Trump has said, for example, that we might need a [tariff (and more)](https://apnews.com/article/us-steel-nippon-trump-biden-steelworkers-1b0fb38077ff0a6b68e64a184f270bac) on cheap, foreign sources of steel in order to protect our domestic production - and blocking the acquisition of US Steel by Nippon Steel.  The goal of this is to strength the domestic steel industry, which is very unionized and in traditional ""blue"" areas.  If they'd stop reflexively opposing *everything* Trump says, we'd be better off.  And that said, the same is true with MAGA and Biden/the Left.  The utter insistence that the only stimulus that should be given is their version and basically bailing on any negotiation *has* to stop.  It leads to *horrible* situations and is basically just making the Presidency stronger - which is going to be to their benefit soon, but eventually the other party gets control!  People tend to forget that in their dreams of Red Waves or a Permanent Majority.",LordFoxbriar,2024-12-05T11:52:08,1
