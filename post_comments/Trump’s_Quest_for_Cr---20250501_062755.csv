"Do we just have no means of punishing this behavior?  He makes billions while every day American citizens are losing their jobs, homes, and ability to feed their families.  How is there no way to stop him?  I thought it was bad that we seemed to forget all our friends and family who are dead because of him, because of his failed leadership during the pandemic.  How much more suffering do regular people have to endure to keep these psychopaths from continuing to hurt us?",JacquoRock,2025-05-01T09:40:28,2

He is literally Constitutionally ineligible to be President but somehow is anyway. This entire presidency is illegitimate. America’s Constitutional democracy has already failed.,Hestia_Gault,2025-05-01T08:32:25,4
