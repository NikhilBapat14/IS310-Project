"This is the fault of voters who put in Soros backed Mary Moriarty, who does not prosecute these inner city youth that they call the KIA Boys.   They steal cars and take them for joyrides and run over bus stops, veer onto sidewalks, etc. She ran on not prosecuting criminals and youth. Many have been arrested up to a dozen times and are as young as 12.",Conscious_String_195,2025-05-08T16:06:22,27
