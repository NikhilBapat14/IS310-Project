"Trump administration White House peace deal plan: Russia gets to keep all the land they invaded. Ukraine gives US 50% of rare earth minerals.  Ukraine says No.  Trump administration: Welp, we tried. Obviously Ukraine doesn‚Äôt want peace",LazzzyButtons,2025-04-25T01:18:23,17

"Wow. You have all obviously not read *The Art of the Deal.* I haven't either because I have a few remaining brain cells to protect, but this is surely one of those situations.  i'm sure trump is going to set up the craziest possible deal that, in the end requires five lawsuits to result in a solution that no ois happy with.  One that somehow leaves him richer.  Not sure where I was going with this, but I'm sure we'll all be happier?",84thPrblm,2025-04-25T01:30:22,3
"People need to stop referencing that art of the deal book, especially considering it was a ghostwriter who wrote the damn thing and not Trump because, come on, he can't even read a book let alone write one.",Leather-Matter-5357,2025-04-25T03:28:58,3

"So let‚Äôs get this straight‚Ä¶Obama let Russia invade Ukraine.  Biden let Russia invade Ukraine.  Neither of these would have happened under Trump, so he says.  So what does he do?  Let Russia continue to invade Ukraine, what else?    Trump is having zero impact ending this conflict.  Smoke and mirrors is not a solution.  It‚Äôs not even teeing up a precursor to a solution.  At best , this nonsense is a pretext to walking away from Ukraine and taking no responsibility for the disaster he will be leaving behind.",dendron01,2025-04-25T06:07:24,2

That's silly. Putin obviously didn't write it.  He probably dictated it out loud while his assistant Trump typed it for him.,gradientz,2025-04-25T01:28:25,14
