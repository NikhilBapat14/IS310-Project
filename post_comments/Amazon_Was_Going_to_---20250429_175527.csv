"This would be a great opportunity to crowdsource some truth-telling. Customers on Amazon ought to calculate the tariff amounts or post price changes caused by the tariffs - and post the information in their reviews of the products...

Just a thought... as I thought posting tariff costs would be a really helpful thing.",phosdick,2025-04-30T06:16:06,1
"When you inform the public what proportion of their purchase is a tariff, the public can immediately point to Trump and his policies.
