New? They've literally been talking about DOGE and the GOP coming after social security and Medicare/Medicaid non-stop for the last 2 months. There is even a fucking tour: https://bsanders-astro.pages.dev/oligarchy/,dmullaney,2025-04-28T00:22:06,50
2005 all over again lol. For those old enough to remember.,TDeath21,2025-04-28T00:24:06,22
"It’s the third rail for a reason. Ask Bush how trying to reform social security goes, and his reforms were pretty innocent compared to what Musk wants.",MelodicFlight3030,2025-04-28T00:44:27,12
"SSA is America's sacred cow. As voters age, the more the populace will be screaming for the Federal Government to keep their hands off of it. The young ones think of it as an entitlement when we actually paid part of our income into it our entire working lives. It was like a savings account. However, they didn't expect us to live this damn long.",invalidpassword,2025-04-28T00:40:57,11
If only they could enact meaningful policy instead of just speeches.,albin0crow,2025-04-28T04:33:04,5

 New issues? We already have issues at home that need to be addressed.,FreddieJasonizz,2025-04-28T00:50:47,1
This is not it. Using fear of an already established program that R's already convince their constituents isn't under threat is not a winning issue. Do better.,noage,2025-04-28T00:49:05,-5
\*NEWS FLASH to the D's\*   The R's have been gunning for SS since it's inception.,I_Am_No_One_123,2025-04-28T07:26:15,8
"Wow, Democrats always finding ways to hit back at the GOP. Social Security is a hot topic for sure. Let's see how this plays out.",Accomplished_Bag8366,2025-04-28T00:27:56,-9
Pepperidge Farm remembers. And not too long after that we had the 2008 financial meltdown. I had hoped that debacle would have permanently taken  Bush’s proposal off the table for good.,raging-peanuts,2025-04-28T05:12:03,7
imagine the gall of neocon Republicans dumping America into Iraq then coming after SS. American politics is so unserious.,Capable_Chart_1329,2025-04-28T02:21:37,3
"His ""reforms"" were privatization to hand it over to Wall Street, 2 years before the biggest financial collapse since the Great Depression. I'd hardly call that innocent.",Individual-Nebula927,2025-04-28T05:12:36,5
The program would be perfectly fine if they just removed the cap.,Demonking3343,2025-04-28T02:07:48,7
"lol, I am in my late 40’s and have been told all of my life, I will not be receiving it. People my age and younger don’t really care about SS. I am pretty sure, I will never get to retire. This is not the winning issue they think it is.",morganisnotmyname,2025-04-28T05:06:15,3
But it literally is under threat. So it’s not using fear on a non existent issue. They literally have been talking about making cuts to Social Security and Medicaid.,Demonking3343,2025-04-28T02:08:28,8
"Don't worry, I have every confidence they'll somehow manage to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.",dmullaney,2025-04-28T00:36:38,5
People have VERY short attention spans. Literally handed the keys right back to a dude who tried to burn it all to the ground in 2020.,TDeath21,2025-04-28T06:33:51,3
"Coming after SS was the “icing on the cake” for a Bush Presidency that was deeply unpopular after launching the Iraq War. As he proposed his SS cash grab, I kept thinking: “He cant be that dumb.”",raging-peanuts,2025-04-28T05:17:25,5
"I could see the benefit of removing the cap, but maybe lower the required percentage instead of the current 6.2%.      Between Social Security (6.2%) and Medicare (1.45%), that 7.65% amounts to almost one months worth of pay",ih-unh-unh,2025-04-28T02:53:57,-1
"If anything, it's one more example of Boomers pulling up the ladder behind them.",Individual-Nebula927,2025-04-28T05:15:04,3
"Until it actually happens, it's not a weapon for the Democrats. Republicans voters just don't believe it, and independent people who are still willing to entertain Trump don't believe it either.",noage,2025-04-28T03:21:48,-2
The cap currently is so far above the median salary that those people can easily afford it. There is no need to reduce the percentage at all.,Individual-Nebula927,2025-04-28T05:14:01,3
"Median salary in some cities is much higher than others.  If a single income family makes $168k in San Jose, they are below median and probably can’t afford a single family residence.      Obviously one or a few cities isn’t enough to sway overall statistics—just meant as illustration, but not everyone lives opulent lives just because they are at the Social Security cap",ih-unh-unh,2025-04-28T05:29:36,1
"No. The median per capita income in San Jose in 2023 was $63,252. Less than half of the social security tax cap income. The median family income (when most parents both work) was $141,565. Still below the social security cap of $160,200 that year.",Individual-Nebula927,2025-04-28T05:38:31,1
