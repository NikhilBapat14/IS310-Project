"Part *sour grapes*, part *sore loser*.   Glad he lost a lot of money for nothing.",clamorous_owle,2025-04-02T16:28:32,86
"Saying ""I expected to lose"" about a race you didn't run in certainly isn't going to help the perception that he's running the party like a puppetmaster.  That's the exact type of thing that got Republicans crushed last night, so please continue",Lengthiest_Dad_Hat,2025-04-02T16:54:28,77
"""Fate of Western civilization"" is just dog whistle Republican terms for White people.  It's that same shit from that infamous Lee Atwater interview where the GOP had to replace the N word with ""Bussing, Urbans, Welfare queen"" etc.",Shadow_Strike99,2025-04-02T17:09:07,27
"So the Nazis lose, again?",BoysenberryGullible8,2025-04-02T16:34:22,21
"The ketamine sometimes makes him confuse the words ""humanity"", ""Western civilization"", ""goth MAGA"", ""his companies"", ""himself"", ...",benganis,2025-04-02T17:15:58,14
"Yes, because when I expect to lose I hand out millions of dollars as well.",annaleigh13,2025-04-02T17:31:56,7
Why is it always the loonies and nutsos that are touted as geniuses?,GaryOoOoO,2025-04-02T16:47:30,4
"So, Musk spent $25 million on a venture he expected would fail? Suddenly the Twitter purchase makes a lot more sense.",Gatsby520,2025-04-02T17:54:25,5
He sure is full of himself.,dbscar,2025-04-02T18:02:54,3
So another bad investment. People still think this man is some kind of genius? For his next trick he should just light a pile of cash on fire.,CelebrationOnly5633,2025-04-02T18:12:49,3
"That’s typical MAGA backtracking! They win it’s a historic victory, they lose, well they really weren’t supposed to win.",beavis617,2025-04-02T17:40:07,2
That’s a convenient rewriting of history for that nazi pig fuck.,HaxanWriter,2025-04-02T17:50:21,2
how do people still love this guy and trump when they constantly go back on what they say every time...?,Privatejoker123,2025-04-02T19:10:38,2
That particular variety of ‘I meant to do that’ is no more convincing.,CommonConundrum51,2025-04-02T19:17:41,2
"Haha, there’s no way he poured all that money into an election he expected to lose.",Clean_Usual434,2025-04-02T17:55:55,1

He’s a loser with a non functional member.,Complex-Present3609,2025-04-02T20:22:00,1
The people I pity the most in all this are the Elon fanboys that just can’t quit him.  It’s fucking sad at this point.,Eradicator_1729,2025-04-02T21:43:52,1
"He is expected to continue pouring money into races at least through the mid terms.   It is also expected that his continued support of Republicans will encourage record numbers of Dems to vote, and will not have the same effect as Trump coming out to support the candidate, but no one seems interested in turning down the money.",crucial_geek,2025-04-02T18:06:30,18
"He spent more than 20 million dollars that he expected to lose.  What a perfect example of the efficiency he espouses. No one could ever accuse him of being a hypocrite with evidence like that. Those traitor former tesla and space x and PayPal employees and everyone that has ever worked with him are liars and should be punished for criticizing him.   ....   Fuck, writing that made me actually nauseous.",VvvlvvV,2025-04-02T20:53:04,6
Nailed it.,clamorous_owle,2025-04-02T17:29:48,9
"Along the way, he conveniently violated Wisconsin Statute § 12.11 on election bribery!  ""My name’s Ekaterina Deistler,"" she said in a video posted Monday morning. ""I did exactly what Elon Musk told everyone to do: sign the petition, refer friends and family, **vote**, and now I have a million dollars.""",benganis,2025-04-02T17:22:21,8
His average daily income would be nearly $39M a day between 2013 and 2023.  Americans are too obsessed with the finances of billionaires.  If you look at the way they make and lose money you will always be depressed.,phxees,2025-04-02T18:16:28,1
"I believe that musk's bizarre persona, drug use, and throwing money around, is beginning to wear thin on some of the MAGAts, and they may start to eventually view him as more of a liability than an asset",LivingIndependence,2025-04-02T18:22:41,14
"Yep, DNC chair in Wisconsin said his favorables with democrats were something insane like -95. Everyone who isn't a cultist can't stand him",Lengthiest_Dad_Hat,2025-04-02T18:41:24,9
"Yeah. I think unwittingly he’s buying Democratic votes.   And anti- Musk votes….Every word, every dollar, every maniacal chain-saw moment just pushing more people against himself",Remote_Clue_4272,2025-04-02T19:11:46,6
"Tbf, 20 mil is literally pocket change to him.",AmTheWildest,2025-04-02T22:34:58,1
She didn't say the instructions included who to vote for ig? But that's not any better.,C_Hawk14,2025-04-02T17:49:55,1
"Really, MAGA should despise Musk.  Bannon does.  But on the other hand Bannon likes what Musk is doing to the Fed Gov., so he gives a temporary pass on that.  Some of what I have been reading is already suggesting that Republican politicians, strategists, etc. are agreeing that if Musk gets involved then Dem turnout will be through the roof,  But as I wrote, I have yet to read a single Republican say they don't won't the money.",crucial_geek,2025-04-02T21:50:38,4

"It’s interesting what they DID do, which is make a video with this script, take it down, and then make a 2nd video without the word “vote”. You seem to be defending the one they deemed too incriminating.",benganis,2025-04-02T18:18:28,2
