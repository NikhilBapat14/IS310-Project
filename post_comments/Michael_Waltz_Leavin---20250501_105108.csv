His imminent departure, alongside that of his deputy Alex Wong, comes after he inadvertently invited Atlantic Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg to join a group thread with senior administration officials, including Defense Secretary [Pete Hegseth](https://www.huffpost.com/topic/pete-hegseth) and Vice President JD Vance, on encrypted messaging app Signal to discuss upcoming military strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen.
