Witkoff, who has said he has developed a friendship with Putin in his role as Trump’s envoy to Moscow   Oh, goody, Putin has made another American friend.

He posted this today:  >... there was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days.  >It makes me think that maybe he doesn’t want to stop the war, he’s just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through “Banking” or “Secondary Sanctions?” Too many people are dying!!!  https://trumpstruth.org/statuses/30781  Not that I believe him.

"The US has to import oil because our refineries cannot process our oil. Since trump has pissed off Canada so much they may decrease oil exports to us.

Republicans will look to any other explanation for the Russia coddling than the obvious one Trump has at every opportunity made clear since 2015.  So here's the only other explanation: Our economic outlook and trade prospects are so fucking grim as a result of the Trump tariff blunders that we need this bad. And it won't fix any of it.,localistand,2025-04-26T20:10:30,9
