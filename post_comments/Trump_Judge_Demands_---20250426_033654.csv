"While this is a whole different beast, I think we all need to know and understand that deportation without due process has been happening since Obama. Including children. Some 300k people were deported under Obama and 75% received no due process.   He did things a bit differently, but many of the same problems existed. He prioritized finding violent criminals - like Trump *says* he's doing - and focused on people who had recently entered the country, rather than those who had established lives here. And of course, he didn't ship people off to foreign prisons for the crime of existing in America. Still, though, things just like this case happened then, too.   We need to be careful about becoming hyper focused on the things we don't like under Trump and losing perspective. Because otherwise every new story is seen as proof of fascism's creeping hold and the death of our country. When a lot of it is just light being shed on problems we just need to fix.",MommyLovesPot8toes,2025-04-26T09:29:06,3

"To be cruel to the child and the people who care about it. It's a demonstration of power over people they don't like, showing them that they can absolutely destroy their lives with zero recourse whenever the fancy strikes them.  This happens because of who they are. They are authoritarians for whom might is right and they are reactionaries who see society as a social and moral hierarchy, i.e. they are better than those they dislike and they can do no wrong no matter what they say or do. Cruelty and violence to those ""below"" them, either in person or by proxy (i.e. done by the state in their name) reinforces that hierarchy and makes it real, allowing them to make their perception of their own status within that hierarchy a reality. In short: they feel better about themselves by hurting those they look down on, so that's what they will do at every opportunity.  This is the natural outcome of giving power to a reactionary movement. They always do this. It panders to this core of selfishness, lack of empathy and rage. It's who they are, deep down. They just don't dare show it when they think there will be consequences, which is why you used to only see this in closed meetings or internet forums. Now that the USA has been bought by the ultra rich, the rule of law is dead and a fascist has been elected president, every one of these people feels free to show, in public, who they really are.",barryvm,2025-04-26T09:29:44,3

"""Also a factor is how the child’s father had been asking the courts to allow her to stay in the U.S. Family lawyers filed an emergency petition Thursday in the Western District of Louisiana demanding her release. The petition said that ICE officials denied the father an appropriate amount of time to speak to the mother over the phone about their child—only about one minute on Tuesday.""  The child could stay with the father. However, the main issue isn't that the child was deported with the mother due to a decision made by the mother. Its that decision wasn't properly validated and the option for the father to keep the child wasn't properly considered. This is another issue where there is a lack of due process. The federal government is saying a woman wrote a letter saying she'd like to keep the child, but we don't know if that's true, if it's been validated, if it was done under circumstances that forced her hands, etc. An immigration judge would need time to consider the case, consider the parents wishes, the various options available etc.   I think people are getting upset because it sounds really bad and not that it isn't, but a mother who is rightfully deported may also have the right to decide for her American born child to go with her to whatever country she's deported to.

"Maybe not even then.    A lot of people on reddit are younger, unmarried, don't have kids or a mortgage or any combination of those.  A few things to remember: Many people are up to their eyes in debt or living at the edge of their means, so they are basically living paycheck-to-paycheck and can't afford the time off nor can they risk being fired if they happen to get arrested at one of these protests or if HR decides to fire them because they were seen at a protest. Being arrested isn't free. There will be costs associate with that which many people couldn't afford, and you have to take time from work (costing money and possibly your job) and now you have an arrest record, even if nothing comes of it, and many companies now will not hire anyone who was arrested for any reason.   There are those who have families that don't want to rock the boat, again because they don't want their actions to affect their families (even though their inactions are doing that already).  If they are in a red area, it isn't exactly smart to stick your neck out and get noticed, should things go down the wrong path.  Some people are more afraid of their neighbors' actions than Trump's Administration, especially if law enforcement will (and has in many cases) happily look the other way.   There there is the belief that ""hey, I'm white, people don't know my politics, I can just blend in with the crowd and survive by not being noticed.""   There are people who literally avoid the news and just about their daily lives.  The media has made the news so depressing and soul sucking to watch, they literally just do not pay attention for their own mental sanity.    And yes, we have those who would rather ignore reality and just say ""It's fine. I'm Fine. Everything's fine!"" instead of facing facts.  They don't want to know that the world is changing.  As long as they refuse to notice it, then nothing is changing (in their minds).   Finally, there are a lot of older people in their 30's-50's (millenials and Gen-X) who most likely protested as young adults but since that time, realized that protests don't really work that well against governments who turn a blind eye to the protests, or paint the protestors as criminals thus the thing they are protesting against is 'good'.   When there were literally thousands of protests against trump and his admin last time he was president and literally none of the protesting changed a single mind of those at the top, it makes sense as to why the number of people attending protests is sharply down from the last time Trump was in office.",bschott007,2025-04-26T15:11:56,2

"Legally they very much are.   If you’re an immigrant in the US, the end of the immigration process (if you want it) is citizenship, at which point you are a naturalized citizen. Prior to that point and pursuant to immigration laws, each and every 'Legal Permanent Resident' MUST carry the original proof of his/her status in the U.S. at ALL TIMES. That means- they need to carry either the plastic green card or their passports with I-551 stamp on it. No photocopy. Only original document issued by USCIS. And they are also required to report their change of address to USCIS within 10 days of moving.  On the other hand, US citizens (whether natural born or naturalized ones) are not required to carry any kind of proof of their status nor they need to report a ‘change of address’ to USCIS whenever they would move.    Yes, there are citizens that have immigrated.

"I’m not worked up. It actually fills my cup to speak to ignorance so this has actually made my day. Thank you for that. Seriously.    If that is true about your dad, I’d encourage you to ask him if he feels like there’s a difference between the terms. He put in the hard work and made a big decision about his personal allegiance that most people don’t even think about. I’m not saying that the story of his (verb) immigration isn’t an important or a part of who he is - but I imagine that he appreciates the recognition of his journey that being a citizen represents. I would think that he also thinks the distinction between him and another immigrant that has not completed the process is an important one. And that’s not to say that he looks down on or feels better than anyone else.   You can’t vote in this country until you are 18. Which means minors can’t vote. I’m an adult now, but I used to be a minor. It was part of my journey to becoming an adult. I can exercise rights now that I could not exercise as a minor. It would be silly for me to argue that the terms minor and adult aren’t mutually exclusive.  Words matter. In the context of your father’s lived experience, yes, people that have immigrated vote. But in the larger context -some citizens were immigrants but not all immigrants are citizens. Saying immigrants vote is wrong and it helps reinforce a false narrative that the right uses to justify disenfranchising legitimate voters. Every time you insist that there’s not a difference, you feed that narrative. You actually help the legitimacy of people that are right now trying to figure out a legal argument to strip your father of his citizenship: https://archive.is/IBhsw   Another example of how words matter - for this OP’s article. Deportation is a legal process, calling this a deportation offers it legitimacy when it, without due process, was actually a government sanctioned kidnapping.   I know that none of this is going to change your mind, but maybe someone else will read it and it will cause them to question things a little more.",johhnny5,2025-04-26T11:11:42,1

All while talking about the legal act of voting. Feels like a have your cake and eat it too kind of thing.   Only in the specific case where you are talking about someone’s history and not their legal status can you maybe make an argument that they aren’t mutually exclusive. I obviously don’t agree. What I’m saying is that by INSISTING that citizens and immigrants aren’t mutually exclusive terms as a blanket statement - you are potentially being unknowingly complicit in furthering harmful rhetoric.   Are you unaware that the right wing in the US has made significant financial investment in ads decrying an “immigrant invasion” and “immigrants being bused places to vote illegally”? People that buy into that shit insist that “immigrants vote” and when they see it repeated without any context, they feel emboldened and like people agree with them. Language is how this spreads. And like it or not, those people feeling emboldened was a step towards how we got to a 2 year old citizen being kidnapped and shipped off without due process.   I’m not saying that’s what you believe in.

">You are conflating lived experience with a legal definition and insisting that you’re right because you don’t MEAN legal definition. All while talking about the legal act of voting. Feels like a have your cake and eat it too kind of thing.   I am very explicitly not talking about the legal definition. I'm not conflating anything. I'm simply using one version of the word.  >Are you unaware that the right wing in the US has made significant financial investment in ads decrying an “immigrant invasion” and “immigrants being bused places to vote illegally”?  Racists are going to be racist no matter what i say. Calling my father an immigrant and saying that he can vote is not going to affect their opinion one way or another, nor is that going to change anyone else's opinion. Everyone, including you, understand my meaning, because it's an extremely common and defined use of the word immigrant. Immigrants *can vote* once they become citizens. The government might not call them that anymore because they have a more narrow definition which is fine, but it's perfectly reasonable and legitimate for us to call people immigrants. It's not a bad word, and it does not in any way help anti-immigrant chumps be what they are.  >Only in the specific case where you are talking about someone’s history and not their legal status can you maybe make an argument that they aren’t mutually exclusive.  That's what we're talking about here in this conversation. Thanks for once again proving that you know exactly what I'm talking about but want to be insulted on other people's behalf.",Lallo-the-Long,2025-04-26T13:01:12,1
"I honestly don’t think that everyone understands what you meant. This entire discussion is around your initial comment of immigrants being able to vote when they got citizenship, correct?   I was surprised when you disagreed with my statement that they were then citizens and not immigrants. Because being a citizen is literally one of only three distinctions that matter when you vote. Are you old enough? Are you a citizen? Do you have a criminal conviction that results in losing your ability to vote where you live?   Nothing else matters in that conversation because unfortunately there are forces in the world that are trying to take away rights by using these terms in ways meant to stoke xenophobia and racism.   You seem like a thoughtful person and I’m honestly surprised that you can’t at least say that you understand the point I’m making. You don’t have to agree with it. I don’t agree with your point and I’ve said as much. Obviously I think once you’re a citizen you are not longer an immigrant. Just like once you’re a butterfly you are no longer a caterpillar. That doesn’t change the story or the importance of how you got to where you are.   You don’t agree with that and are entitled to that opinion. But you do see the point I’m making right? And you understand what my intention is? And you understand that my intention isn’t hateful or evil? It’s just to point out that we should be intentionally precise with language in the face of fascist assholes. We can at least agree that fascists are assholes, right?   ",johhnny5,2025-04-26T14:10:41,1
>You seem like a thoughtful person and I’m honestly surprised that you can’t at least say that you understand the point I’m making.  I do understand. I understand that there is a distinction between immigrant in the legal sense and immigrant in the colloquial sense. What i don't understand is why you're accusing me of helping anti immigrant policy by using the word in the colloquial sense.,Lallo-the-Long,2025-04-26T14:19:02,1
"Since apparently it wasn't clear, I want to be 100% explicit that I wasn't my intention to accuse you of anything and to that end, I made an effort to specifically write ""unknowingly complicit"". I'm sorry that it came across that it was an accusation.   In terms of understanding where I am coming from, my goal was simply to point out that bad actors are using the same words that you think can be used interchangeably to proliferate hateful ideas that aren't good for democracy. And while it seems irritating that I keep harping on about it and being pedantic - in the overall context of this conversation - one about legally voting and deporting citizens - not caring about the specificity of the words we use and the context in which we use them is something that ultimately helps those bad actors spread those ideas. It's unfair and annoying, but that's how it works.   [Here's a great example that I saw on another thread the other day about how the words change to make ideas more palatable.](https://old.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1ie374k/christian_nationalists_are_swooning_over_jd/ma4by4v/) And to be clear, I'm NOT suggesting that you hold any of the same hateful ideals!   I think we should all work to eliminate any leeway that any hateful asshole might use to muddy waters and push an agenda by being as specific and correct as possible. If someone complains about immigrants voting illegally, I think it's our job to correct them and say, ""You mean non-citizens, right? Because there's hardly any evidence that non-citizens are voting in ways that would affect our elections. And by the way, you and I agree that non-citizens should not vote."" Immigration has nothing to do with it and should not be part of the conversation in that context.   Again, I wasn't trying to be heated about YOU specifically and I'm sorry if that wasn't clear.",johhnny5,2025-04-26T14:47:44,1
