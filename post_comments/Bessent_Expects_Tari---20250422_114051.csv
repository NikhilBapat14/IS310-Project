"Sure, just like fires eventually die down.  I didn't think Trump would be ousted via the 25th because he has a cabinet full of sycophants, but I think the oligarchs have had about enough of this tariff bullshit. They have enough money and influence to buy off most of the cabinet and they already have JD in their pocket. If they don't get some market stability soon, and they won't as long as Trump is in office, they will work on taking Trump down.",MangroveWarbler,2025-04-22T11:45:03,6
It's quite something that it is Bessent and Powell who are keeping the country's economy from crashing and burning.  Two people who are coping with a modern day Nero who golfs while the economy burns.,I405CA,2025-04-22T11:43:28,11
"Yeah, right. And I’m dating Sofia Vergara right now. /s  The fact that Wall Street is falling for this blatant excuse of propaganda is absurd. Trump is almost going to let the stretch into 2026, whether we like it or not.",IAmArique,2025-04-22T12:50:04,6

Bessent is expecting trump to cave.,nwgdad,2025-04-22T12:23:28,1
"Why? Because they seem to be heavily benefiting from it in long term prospects. There will be some short term instability, but China will come out with a far more central role in world trade.  Why would they de-escalate when 10 years from now these short-sighted US policies will benefit them heavily?",beekersavant,2025-04-22T12:23:46,1

"*From Bloomberg News reporters Daniel Flatley, Jorgelina Do Rosario, and Kerim Karakaya:*  US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told a closed-door investor summit Tuesday that the tariff standoff with China is unsustainable and that he expects the situation to de-escalate.  Bessent added that negotiations haven’t started but that a deal is possible, according to people who attended his session at an event hosted by JPMorgan Chase & Co. in Washington, which wasn’t open to the public or media.  The Treasury Department didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.  US stocks rose after his comments, with the S&P 500 index gaining as much as 2.9% as of 12:28 p.m. in New York, while the dollar and Treasuries steadied.  The US Treasury chief spoke on the sidelines of the [International Monetary Fund](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/13347Z:US) and [World Bank](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/8176888Z:US)’s spring meetings, as finance ministers and central bankers gather to assess the fallout of President Donald Trump’s trade war.",bloomberg,2025-04-22T11:41:28,1
Yeah from the same people hoping you go away.,TintedApostle,2025-04-22T11:41:52,1
"Both the U.S. and China have a lot to lose so both have incentives to back down. China's economy was already struggling before the tariffs, and although China is only America's 3rd largest trading partner, the bulk of the goods China exports to us are cheap everyday items. The U.S. is a consumer-driven economy so we depend on those cheap goods. China can at least revert to its propaganda playbook to buy itself some time with its citizens. China is playing for time hoping that the American people pressure Trump to give up his delusional foreign trade ideas.",dr_z0idberg_md,2025-04-23T00:29:03,1

"> Yeah, right. And I’m dating Sofia Vergara right now. /s  Wait, what?  We are going out on Friday!?!  /s  Trump needs to come up with something quick.  Tech stocks are trading in a close range and IPO's are on hold.  So quick money isn't happening for them.  Institutional investors are watching closely, they can't charge high fees if there isn't matching profits.  Which they can't get today.",kiltedturtle,2025-04-22T13:15:12,3
At this point China has figured out that they have the may in fact have the stronger hand. Why would anyone assume that they are just going to forgive and forget? The US has irreparably damaged its soft power on a global scale and you can bet other countries are going to try to capitalize on America’s weakness. ,legocastle77,2025-04-22T11:49:12,7
"As a - very ancedotal - data point, I recently talked to a Latin American friend who has been living in China for the past 10 years or so. I asked him how the Chinese public is reacting to the tariff war.  His answer? They aren't.  They are confident that their government has done enough amassing of resources and planning to weather this storm, so for the most part people just don't care about it. People on the street don't care. The government isn't panicking about it. The media - of course - follows the government lead. Everyone agrees that China as a country and culture will survive this without a problem and they aren't scared of a recession.  So there's literally *no reason* for China to let deescalate, unless Trump blinks and makes the first move in that direction. The 'Deal Maker' has really painted himself into a very stupid corner.",HarwellDekatron,2025-04-22T12:09:41,3
The more likely scenario is that this ends when Congress takes the tariff power back from Trump.  The question is **when** that happens.  Do the current Republicans discover their spines and build a bipartisan veto proof majority?  Or do they hand the Congress to the Democrats when their servility to Trump crashes us into a depression.,code_archeologist,2025-04-22T11:58:10,5
Do a little googling on JD vance  Peter Thiel.(and add Musk)  Thiel is Vance's patron.,MangroveWarbler,2025-04-23T08:33:36,1
"Bessent seems to be typical of a lot of Trump's first-term advisors.  They start out thinking that they can tame and control Trump.  But then they realize that he's nuts and remarkably stupid.  Rumor has it that Bessent threatened to resign over the tariffs and that he is complaining to Wall Street leaders that Trump is impossible to manage.    The establishment right often falls into this trap of believing that they can work with right-wing populists, only to find out once they are stuck with them that they can't.  They would be better off if they would find the next Barack Obama, rather than trying to turn Trump lemons into lemonade.",I405CA,2025-04-22T12:07:44,8
