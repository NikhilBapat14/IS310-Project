Oh no! Summer vacations might be in jeopardy!   How is this confusing? You need proper ID to fly. That's either a REAL ID or a US Passport.,Mountain_Man_88,2025-05-07T13:41:58,7
"Real ID has been around for how long now? How are some states still struggling with this?      When the real ID thing first came out, my state just set themselves up to issue their IDs as Real ID complaint going forward and the people in this state don't have to deal with the ""my ID isn't Real ID"" headache.",DonkeyMilker69,2025-05-07T15:15:37,2

"I can't keep it straight, are these children incapable of handling adult responsibilities like getting their ID and understanding interest on college loans, or are they adults whose opinion we are supposed to take seriously? Because if you can't figure this shit out, I don't want you voting because you obviously aren't smart enough to cast an informed vote.",JustinCayce,2025-05-07T16:14:29,2
From what I have been reading and the lies of the left about how Real ID is being implemented I am not surprised that there is confusion.  This is only the last Phase of Real ID.   Sadly I doubt it Congress over time will let it be.,ComputerRedneck,2025-05-07T11:07:41,1
