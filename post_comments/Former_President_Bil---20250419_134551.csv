"Even with his voice hoarse and little slower in his delivery, Bill Clinton **still** commands and captures the audience with his genuine empathy and historical story telling.      I'm old enough to remember him [addressing the nation from the WH podium](https://youtu.be/5WzEgcdk5oU?si=MiiCucRYwywS38v2)    and where are we 30 years later?",ms_directed,2025-04-19T13:54:14,22
"Timonthy McVeigh was angry about what happened at Waco.  At Waco, an Adventist cult leader who called himself the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, prophesied that his cult would die in a battle against the Federal government.  When confronted by the federal government for stockpiling weapons, cult leaders committed mass suicide by starting a fire the killed many of the cult's followers, including children.",Mindless_Listen7622,2025-04-19T14:54:23,8

"Since the 7th Day Adventists are one of the ""Four Cults"", I really don't have any issue calling David Koresh a cult leader - he was weird even for an Adventist.  ""Charismatic"" and ""cult"" are often interchangeable;  greedy and misguided False Prophets abound.",Mindless_Listen7622,2025-04-19T16:04:09,3
"i compared charismatics like JFK and MLK to Jim Jones, Hitler, Koresh...they all had the charisma to get the attention of a lot of people and charge them with a cause, but they used that power in starkly different ways.",ms_directed,2025-04-19T16:09:41,4
