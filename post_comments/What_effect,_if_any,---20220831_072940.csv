"It presumably sends the message that Moscow elites are not immune to the conflict, and that there are costs and risks to war. Whether that is a wise message to send is a separate question.",LiberalAspergers,2022-08-31T19:48:33,4
"It makes it harder for Putin to deescalate the conflict if he wants to. Alexander Dugin will just increase his pro-war rhetoric and his assassinated daughter will add pathos to his message.   The Russian far-right has been more brazen in its criticism of the war than the anti-war left, and has more influence. They are unhappy that Russia has not made more gains, have not fully mobilized, have not decided to outright annex Donetsk and Luhansk.  It should be remembered that almost certainly Alexander Dugin was the target. He would not be a top priority for Ukrainian special forces. It could have been the Kremlin wanting to create a martyr.   But my guess is this is just shady boardwalk empire style politics involving internal struggles within the far right and the broader Russian kleptocracy, more to do with money and power than ideology, and now the various factions will try to spin the death according to their own narrative.",pluralofjackinthebox,2022-09-03T07:52:28,2
