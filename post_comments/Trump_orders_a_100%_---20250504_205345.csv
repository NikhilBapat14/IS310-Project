"He's taking a hatchet to everything that makes America great: science, culture, tech, economy, and legal immigration....  I assume this means 1 dollar in tax for each dollar spent abroad? So Jurassic World Rebirth was shot in Thailand, so instead of 200M cost of production it is now 400M before marketing?  This comes at a time when supply of films is an issue, these tariffs will be prohibitively expensive for many studios and compound the problem. Are studios gonna pass on that cost to theatres? Studios, distributors and theatres are already pressured: COVID, Dual strikes, Streaming, decline in cable and rise in production costs. This might break them.  Be mindful when it comes to movies and shows, the US has a gargantuan trade surplus, meaning the US will be pained much much much more than the other countries if they retaliate; we import very little of their movies while they import a lot of ours.  Also be mindful that in England, Canada, Australia, New Zealand...etc. they have a whole production industry intertwined with Hollywood, pulling all American production at once will wreck their economies. So be prepared for retaliation, which again disproportionately harms the country with the trade surplus which is the US.  Also, Europe mandates streamers that 30% of their online content be European. So these streamers either continue having access to that market and pay the tariff once they show the content domestically, or leave that market all together, or not show that content domestically which is unlikely.   Many of the tentpole films for all studios are filmed in the UK: Marvel, DC, Lucasfilm, F1, Mission Impossible, Nolan...etc. Not to mention most of the tentpole shows; Bridgerton, House of the Dragon, Last of Us, Star Wars. Also 100% of animated films except for Disney Animation and Pixar are made abroad, Disney is the only company that makes its animation in the US.",LackingStory,2025-05-04T21:15:15,6

At this point, and it should be clear to every American, the Republican party is taken advantage of Trump and his idiocy. They keep him propped up and in exchange they quickly ram through bills and executive orders that would otherwise fall flat.  Everything, all of these executive orders, save the ones related to Tariffs, are the wishes of Republican lawmakers and their financers. Trump does not care about legislation, he does not care about the will of the people, and he most certainly does not care about whether he is executing on his Presidential responsibilities; he gets to appear powerful and that's all that matters to him.  The GOP and DNC are cooked. Even if they were to impeach, they are cooked. Their miscalculation has led the USA to the brink of civil war and the world to the brink of another World War.

"""Trump’s target does not appear to be foreign films per se, but rather the outsourcing of production by Hollywood studios who for decades have used overseas studios and locations to lower costs as well as take advantage of interesting or unusual backdrops. To take some random recent examples: the new Tom Cruise film Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning was mostly shot in the UK, at Longcross studios in Surrey and the Lake District, but also in Malta, Norway and South Africa, as well as an American aircraft carrier docked in Italy. Marvel’s new superhero blockbuster Thunderbolts\* was filmed in Atlanta Georgia, but a key scene took place at Merdeka 118, a skyscraper in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and its score was recorded at Abbey Road studios in London.  ""Revenue plays a large role in Hollywood thinking. While North America (comprising the US and Canada) remains the biggest single market, [with around $8.8bn](https://gower.st/articles/sparkling-december-finishes-2024-high-3bn-global-box-office-2024-total-30bn/) (£6.6bn) in box office takings in 2024, it is dwarfed by international income of around $21.1bn.
