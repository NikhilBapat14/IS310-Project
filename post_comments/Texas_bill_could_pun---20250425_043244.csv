Next it will be illegal to ship obscene books in Texas. Its not about protecting children at all its about silencing speech and ideas that make them uncomfortable.,sedatedlife,2025-04-25T04:35:40,44

"But I was told that attacking books at school libraries wasn't an issue because you could just buy the book.   This is what is so frustrating about these types of issues. You get people to agree to a water-downed version of your idea, and then expand it way past what those people signed up for.   And this does happen. All the time. I know a lot of people just assume everyone is always in on the end goal, but people do get tricked by this kind of stuff.  You start with a surface level argument. ""There are obscene books that young kids shouldn't have access to."" You may not agree with that, but it doesn't really matter. A lot of people do as a very blanket statement. Like the average person would say erotica  shouldn't be in a school. And in a store it should be sectioned off where kids can't access. And please note I understand that this stuff is being used to target LGBT material as 'obscene', but that is kind of my point. You start out with being generalized. Some people will get the dog whistle, but they aren't really important. You already have them for your cause. You are looking to try and convince the general public. Random parent isn't really going to be like 'Ya, fuck LGBT books' (Some definitely are, but again, not really talking about them). But a random parent is more likely to be 'Well, yes, of course I don't want my little Timmy to have access to smut', without really considering what they are thinking about is not the same thing these laws are targeting. Because, it turns out, schools already do filter out truly adult only material.",Roseking,2025-04-25T06:34:41,7

"Their understanding of free speech is best viewed through the lens of hierarchy and superiority.  They believe there is a natural social hierarchy that should not be questioned.  They of course see themselves at the top of this hierarchy.  Thus, they have freedom of speech.  They have the right to say whatever they want, and you have to take it, you have to listen to it:  because to not listen to it, to not take it, that‚Äôs a violation of their freedom.  But you?  You do not have freedom of speech.  Because your freedom of speech threatens their position on the hierarchy.  If you use your freedom of speech, it‚Äôs a threat to their freedom of speech.  And their freedom of speech is more important than yours because they are superior,  It‚Äôs gross, but it‚Äôs how they see the world.",Odd-Mode-4924,2025-04-25T06:00:59,12
"Dystopian fiction--Bradbury's *Farenheit 451*, Orwell's *1984*, Rand's *Anthem*, etc.--used to be a required unit in 8th grade English Language Arts in Texas.  I teach college. Every year, I poll my students to see how many have read *1984* (there's a great example in it related to a pretty difficult concept). When I started over a decade ago, about half the class would raise their hand. Now, I'm lucky if even one student in the class has read *any of them*, let alone *1984*.  At some point, I don't know when, they took it out. I can't find *any* reference to dystopian fiction in the requirements (TEKS) for any grade.",WNxVampire,2025-04-25T07:14:32,4

"I‚Äôm 28 in GA and never read 1984 or any other classic dystopian novels. I did go to private school but my mom went to the same school and ironically read it in 1984. Starting in January I made it a point to read all of them. So far I‚Äôve read animal farm, 1984, and the handmaids tale. I‚Äôve started Brave new world. Next is 451 and the jungle.",hideousbeautifulface,2025-04-25T07:17:33,3
"451 is my favorite of the lot, then *1984*. *Brave New World* is also good, but there's something about Huxley's style I don't care for.  While people commonly compare things to *1984*, I find Bradbury's 451 to be the most prescient and pertinent. So, I hope you enjoy that one when you get to it.",WNxVampire,2025-04-25T07:31:16,1
