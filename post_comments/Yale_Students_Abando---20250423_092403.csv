"Just so everyone knows, part of the reason they were protesting is because Itamar Ben-Gvir will be speaking to Yale students, if you're unaware, for many years he had a portrait of the terrorist Baruch Goldstein on his wall(and probably still has one somewhere)  Goldstein murdered 29 Palestinians while they were praying, injuring over 120.  Ben-Gvir also lays a wreath on Goldstein's grave each year on the Jewish holiday of Purim, which is the day of the terror attack.",BengalsGonnaBungle,2025-04-23T11:13:00,29

Oh please - go on and spare everyone your Hasbara BS and go over to the r/Israel sub.  The protest was over Ben Gvir's attendance near campus. Ben Gvir is a literal war criminal who is even mocked by members of the Knesset in Israel for his views. He publicly advocates for the re-settlement of Gaza and the complete annexation of the West Bank.   A re-settlement of Gaza and the annexation of the West Bank would both be illegal under international law and would constitute ethnic cleansing.,walkallover1991,2025-04-23T09:52:20,30

"There's an easy test to see if your protest is to protect innocents or if it's just a run-of-the-mill antisemitic HAMAS groupie.  Check for the number of protesters demanding the release of Israeli hostages held by HAMAS. That's a VERY easy test.  For the record, I do not support Israel's methods of war. But I also equally do not support HAMAS' methods of war.",CyberaxIzh,2025-04-23T11:05:13,-13

HAMAS groupies in the oh-so-oppressed universities in the US show otherwise.  > Palestine is suffering immensely and Netanyahu wants the Gaza strip stripped of people for settlements.  They are doing a very poor job of it, then. According to the HAMAS' own propaganda, the population of Gaza Strip has increased since October 2023.",CyberaxIzh,2025-04-23T11:09:32,-2
"This is just nonsense young atheist thinking. Civil religions provide the exact same justifications and mechanics that you attribute to supernatural religions.  edit: this coward replied then blocked me. Here is my reply:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_religion  I didn't call you a young atheist, just categorized the line of thinking that you were engaging in.   ""nothing has the means of mass indoctrination as religion, nothing encourages angry hateful tribalism as much as religion does, nothing discourages logic and compassion as much as religion does."" This is an unprovable assertion and is also magical thinking.   Here is a more research and scientifically based explanation of  escalation and sources of hatred. It is specifically about culture war, but the premise is explanatory of these elements you are attributing solely to religion.   https://youtu.be/HkFZNCBcYHw?si=bm9kBLUArqqxknbs",FeedMeACat,2025-04-23T12:38:58,0

"Had all the attention been on violence against HAMAS, you'd complain that no one cares about the victims.   People are dying, dude. Innocent people. So that's where the focus is.   Just say you don't care. Because that seems to be the case. You're spending a hell of a lot of time nitpicking at someone else's protest, from the comfort of your own seat.
