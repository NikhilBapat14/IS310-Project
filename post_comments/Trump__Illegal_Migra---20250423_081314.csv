Put them before an immigration judge to determine status. Immediately deport those not found to have credible reasons to be here. There's the due process. Why is this complicated?,social_dinosaur,2025-04-23T08:34:13,817
"Due process and the rights afforded to them does not necessarily include a trial. Not everything and everyone has to go to trial. For stuff like this it’s just a waste of time. All they need to do is determine citizenship status, past that it’s largely discretionary on the part of the executive.   One can make arguments that it should be different, less power to the president or more rights for non citizens, but that doesn’t change the fact of what the law is now.",JackandFred,2025-04-23T08:36:13,98
100 percent agree. You can't let in/fly in millions and require a hearing to deport each one. That's invasion by a million cuts. The democrats are guilty of treason to this country for making this happen.,Feeling_Maize_2,2025-04-23T08:25:09,27

Nearly every president before now has deported millions of people. None of them had to put every illegal immigrant in front of a judge before deporting them.,Darthwxman,2025-04-23T22:08:18,2
"The MSM and the Left are claiming that every human on earth is entitled to full 6th Amendment due process rights including the right to a full jury trial. But that's a complete and unabashed lie.   DUE PROCESS simply means the process that is DUE to an individual, but what exactly is DUE depends on circumstances and it can vary wildly. In the case of illegal immigrants, due process historically can be as little as showing up in front of a Judge, the judge determines the person's immigration status and then they're out the door and on their way back to their own country, a less than 20 minute process.",Teary_Oberon,2025-04-23T17:44:29,4

I don’t think there’s an issue with that. Paying to have them housed in a Supermax prison is the part that’s getting him in trouble with the courts.,LemartesIX,2025-04-23T21:24:08,15
"If you are here legally, they already have your information, fingerprints and photos. It is very easy to prove you are a legal resident or are here on visa.   My green card got stolen when I was in Mexico. I arrived at the border, they knew who I was within a few minutes after looking up my finger prints and this was back in the 90s. I had to pay the fee to renew my green card and was let back in  a few hours later when they finished processing my application.   It’s not that difficult to determine one’s legal status. They don’t necessarily need a court for majority of the people in question. ",Blahblahnownow,2025-04-23T10:05:38,88
"Because it takes years for the court date. They need a new system. Triage of sorts. Ice and federal agents need to be re interviewing them. Those with highest level of actually receiving asylum should be first. Those people would have all evidence available. Then the next level and the next. There should be a penalty, if they are found to be gaming the system.",Dazzling_Pink9751,2025-04-23T14:46:03,27
"Our caseload is 800,000 per year, there are an estimated 6-20 million illegal migrants who entered under Biden.     So it'll take between 7.5 and 33 years in order to resolve this in the courts.  Edit: Some people think the number above is the DoJ caseload, the DoJ caseload is actually 66,000 per year, the number above is from the existing immigration courts.",DRKMSTR,2025-04-23T09:00:50,128
"So you’d do this for every illegal entry?   This would mean you’d be in favor of removing the current (legal) expedited removal process, which is ridiculous.   The expedited process applies to anyone here under 2 years, does not require a judge and you cannot appeal.   It’s literally been used in millions of cases.",RotoDog,2025-04-23T09:29:50,32
"I don’t think it even has to be a judge. Why can’t ICE agents themselves make the determinations? With the technology and databases we have today it should be a simple matter of a quick computer database search to get all the Information needed to determine a persons legal status. If their shit stinks, toss them on a plane back to their country of origin. Fast, simple, and effective. Why drag the process out for mo this to years on end waiting for a judge to see each and every one of them?",Tasty_Explanation_20,2025-04-23T20:01:35,4
"It isn't, but doing this will get you tarred and feathered by the Democrats that for some strange reason believe you need to have a fully jury trial before a deportation.",cplusequals,2025-04-23T09:37:37,-7
> Put them before an immigration judge   No. Non-US citizens do not deserve special treatment under the law.   Allow them the due process guaranteed by Constitution - which obviously does not include time before an immigration judge.,Critical_Concert_689,2025-04-23T13:39:50,-9
"The discretion is part of how we got here .. I'd go the opposite way, the Executive should be forced to carry out the law and deport these people and anything else should come with penalties (eg. contempt of court, disqualification for office, or perhaps charges of conspiracy to commit the crimes they are abetting through lack of enforcement).  Biden had way too much ""discretion"" to NOT secure our border.",JackNoir1115,2025-04-23T08:56:13,24

"I'm fine with all who came across the border at places other than a port of entry to be summarily deported. Illegal aliens are exactly that, illegal. They knew that's how they'd be classified and were just hoping for sympathy. I don't have any.",social_dinosaur,2025-04-23T15:02:26,11
"A good chunk of those entries are ""come and go""s and immigration judges can be spun up way quicker than normal ones by the DoJ. Your estimates are unrealistically high as it over estimates required deportations and underestimates max removals per year.",cplusequals,2025-04-23T09:39:28,172

"> Executive should be forced to carry out the law   Technically, they ARE required by law to ""deport these people.""   But they're also in charge of enforcement of THIS law.

"I'm fine with it, too.  But that's not how our immigration law is written.  All you have to do is get on U.S. soil and claim asylum.  It's dumb and Congress should get off their asses and make illegal immigration undeniably, unquestionably illegal.  As in, if you didn't come through a legitimate port of entry and declare yourself immediately, off you go.
