"If it is indeed not lawful the number of laws that have actually ***been*** violated by everyone partaking in this grotesque scheme must be staggering. Real crimes of basically abducting people and transporting them out of the country and handing them over to 'alien' forces who hold them captive and... whatever has been and will be done to them. The number of basic constitutional rights that have been violated and laws that have been broken must make a rather long list.  Actual people have committed these acts, basically crimes. Which means these people are just as much subjected to the law for their actions as everyone else would be if they violated the law. How is that going to pan out?",HumanWithComputer,2025-04-26T11:25:29,26
">U.S. intelligence agencies have [found](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/04/17/us-intelligence-tren-de-aragua-deportations-trump/) that the crux of the administration’s justification for invoking the law is not true — that the gang is not working alongside Nicolás Maduro’s regime to invade the United States.  So he used a nonsense reason to invoke the AEA, but that's totally fine and okay apparently. He's been using it all this time with no one stopping him.  This is how trump operates. He doesn't wait for permission to do things. He just does whatever he wants and then waits for someone to stop him. And right now, he's using the AEA in a way it's not supposed to be used, and no one is stopping him, and people are suffering in the CECOT Concentration Camp right now because of it.  People always say ""trump can't do this and that. That's illegal/unconstitutional."" It doesn't matter unless someone actually does something to stop him from doing it.",sachiprecious,2025-04-26T11:30:54,22
"Guys, he’s a rapist conman traitor that evaded the law by becoming president and we shouldn’t be letting this criminal throw us into “constitutional crisis”.  That’s the heart.",LuvKrahft,2025-04-26T11:46:14,9
All the deportations to El Salvador should have been immediately halted the moment the government claimed they couldn't reverse the process for deportees outside US territory.,SanityPlanet,2025-04-26T23:06:08,3
