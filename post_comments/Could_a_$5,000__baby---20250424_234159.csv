"It doesn't even cover a fraction of the cost of having a baby in a hospital. If we want to increase the population, roll out universal free healthcare.   But there's no money in it for them to do that.",RealGianath,2025-04-25T00:17:49,16
"Is $5000 enough to make a lifelong commitment to something living, in a country where they may be round up and put on a list someday because they have autism or ADHD? Is $5000 enough to offset the average medical cost of delivery and prenatal care? (10k-30k) Is 5k enough to make me forget that we can’t even guarantee them fresh/clean water or clean air or healthcare? Or access to food that isn’t contaminated or properly inspected? Safety and equality if they’re born a woman or queer/transgender?   No it’s not. And the fact they’re trying to offer this shows a complete lack of understanding of declining birth rates. 5k is something you offer as rebate on an electric car, not bringing a living breathing thing into existence.

5k doesn't even pay for the delivery(13k to 22k)  . talk about waving money in people's faces to make them do dumb things. if you get 5k and blow it on whatever it just does not even compute. first year is another 16k to 28k . one emergency can add 20k to 50k. infant daycare 15k .  Im sure others can think of more costs . but the 5k amounts to nothing.,Capt_Janeways_coffee,2025-04-25T00:24:34,5

"Funny country we have here. It’s better to ask citizens to pay other citizens to have kids…then, say, allow people to enter into the country who will actually pay taxes and willingly have children of their own.   But yes. Let’s create a socialist system so our population grows, only to then take away their child care, education, meals, books, sports, and special needs once they are born.

No. That shit doesn't cover anything for long term childcare. Hell what is stopping someone from having a baby grabbing the money and than mistreating/neglecting the kid... Wait a minute this is the shit they complained about people only having kids to get money from the government. These idiots are literally encouraging stupid people to have kids to get a one time pay out for each kid.,Shiplord13,2025-04-25T01:40:59,2

"If you bring a child into this world, knowing the ever growing threat of globalism, global systemic organized corruption and crime, and you still decide to contribute male/female whatever to the creation of a child that will be forced to live in a corrupt, exploitative, poor world that is ever changing for the worst...  you're sick and deranged... that's revolting to doom that to an innocent soul.   Humanity won't die out. The ""white race"" won't die out. If you think so, that's poof your amygdala runs you like a pimp and you can't rationalize anything. There will always be rapes, idiot people, those who force breed, liars, and those who have the means to produce children.

"I live in Sweden and we have pretty high amount of child birth. They key things you get are.    Every month you get 100 dollar per kid(in our currency ofcourse)  2 kids gives you 230 (multiple child bonus, this is tax free money that does move you up in income bracket).    Free healthcare. Free kindergarten, Free school up to university. Student loan at the national borrowing level to cover cost of living during studies.    Almost 2 years of payed parental leave per child. 3 months that is looked to the father to force the fathers to take care of child. Usually taken the last months before child starts in kindergarden. First 10 days after child is born both parents are off from work because it is such hard time. Can be extended to a month by cutting off two weeks at the end of period. ",rincewind007,2025-04-25T00:45:00,19

"Also that 100 dollar a month is upto 15 years old, between 15-18 the money is still payed but goes to the kid directly so they can learn about money. Until 15 years old there is no demand to get the money.   After 15 years old the kid need to show up in school otherwise you lose access for a month etc..  Also the salary gap between mother and fathers are smaller since men are also expected to stay home like 7 months during parental leave. I have a male employee and he just informed me that he will be off between January to August next year. That is Kinda standard. It is custom to give the employer plenty of heads up.
