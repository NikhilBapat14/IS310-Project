">1: The sacking of all US military leaders who are 'uncooperative' with trump, and then stacking it with loyal lackeys. Allowing him to use the army in whatever way he personally wants without anyone to challenge him if an order is illegal or not.  Technically yes but you get into a [Saturday Night Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Massacre) situation which would cause more problems.  >2: Invading Canada.  Short of Canada attacking us, almost impossible.  Even the [War Powers Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Powers_Resolution) requires a national emergency to move without Congressional approval.  >3: Trump getting ride of term limits and making himself president for life.  No.  This is laughable.  Those limits are per the Constitution and cannot be changed without an Amendment.  And that is, frankly, impossible given its requirements for passage.  >4: Dismantelling, arresting, imprisoning, and execution of whatever members of the Democratic party he'd like.  Oh come on, is this a fever dream?  This isn't worth a reply.  Its delusional.  >5: Federal nation wide abortion ban.  Not without Congress passing a law, which he's already said [he would veto](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/01/trump-abortion-veto-national-ban-00182091).  >6: Stripping women of the right to vote, either in some states or across all.  You're frankly insane.  >7: Stripping all non-white/non-Christians of the right to vote, in some states or across the country.  You need to be banned.  >8: Arresting and imprisoning or executing, without trial, all political dissidents. Anyone from Harris to Jimmy Kimmal to youtube leftists.  You're just making crap up at this point.  This was approved?  >9: Arresting and deporting all gay, trans, or queer people.  You're frankly just insane and making stuff up or basing it off of the losest of quotes from people who are misquoting Trump or his positions.  Please, provide me with *one* source of this.  >Yes I'm anxious and yes I'm trying to stay away from the news, but sometimes news gets through anyway. I also don't know much about the American political process, so it's easy for me to think the answer to all of these is a resounding yes.  You need to leave here, go Google and read up on something other where you are getting your news now.  You're in an echo chamber of echo chambers and nothing you are saying with these last questions have any semblance of truth unless he's a Sith Lord who has been lying this whole time.",LordFoxbriar,2024-11-13T20:58:37,1

"So you think it can get 2/3 of both houses of Congress and then 3/4 of the states?  I’ll take that bet. $500 to the charity of the winners choice.  Heck, I’ll make it $5k.",LordFoxbriar,2024-11-13T21:28:04,2
"Not exactly. Rules can be changed and precedent is already ignored. They will change the rules to make the threshold lower and then pass it. It won't be something like president-for-life, more along the lines of the outgoing president gets to appoint the new one.",drhappycat,2024-11-13T21:45:09,2
"Yeah, Trump already campaigned on getting rid of birthright citizenship. That's guaranteed by the 14th amendment, so theoretically it would need another amendment to take it away. But Trump's team is arguing that actually we've been interpreting it incorrectly the whole time, and the 14th amendment wasn't actually intended to guarantee birthright citizenship--so he doesn't actually to pass an amendment to end it, all he needs is to persuade the courts that his interpretation of that law is correct. And the Supreme Court is probably persuadable to that if Trump takes the time to make it a priority. He just hasn't made it a priority yet.  That's the case for a lot of this stuff on this list. I don't know if most of it is especially likely, but it's unlikely because Trump is probably too lazy to do it, not because it's logistically impossible. Once you have a court on your side that's willing to ignore historical precedent, that's 90% of the battle. Almost everything can go through them, and they can find an interpretation to justify it.",anneoftheisland,2024-11-14T12:11:04,2
">Rules can be changed and precedent is already ignored.  To change the process to amend the Constitution requires an amendment to the Constitution.  And the SCOTUS will strike down anything that is blatantly unconstitutional.  ""Oh, but what if SCOTUS just goes with it?  Dur de dur..."" well in that case let's have the discussion what if aliens come down and implant all Democrats with mind control devices and command them to do a filibuster dance before every vote?  And then they force everyone to do lines of cocaine after every vote?  And then Hillary will leap forth with divine righteousness and slay the aliens and install herself as God-Empress of the World and lead us into the stars in her immortal, alien-lizard-human hybrid form that gives her superhuman abilities!  What then MAGAT???  I'm fine with hypotheticals but they have to be *realistic* hypotheticals.",LordFoxbriar,2024-11-14T08:08:43,1
