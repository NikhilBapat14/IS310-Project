Anyone else tired of trying to make sense of it? Anyone feel like their life's work is being thrown in the trash? Anyone else feel nothing but resignation?,Gator1523,2025-04-09T16:23:40,10
He doesn’t care about the American people .. his followers love this abusive father because it feels just like the real thing from their own lives,supercali45,2025-04-09T17:28:07,2

He caved because of the bond market. He doesn't have a clue what he's doing. And where's Peter Navarro? He was suspiciously absent from the press conference. Did he fall out a window?,baby_budda,2025-04-09T19:14:35,1
I don’t believe for a second it doesn’t include China. Because if he’s only calling it off for those that did not retaliate then we still have tariffs on Canada. There is no way the tariffs on China can stand because his billionaire buddies are going to lose billions every day. He just doesn’t want to admit they are part of the 90 day pause,Winter_Dragonfly_452,2025-04-09T20:33:33,1
"He’s so chaotic and unhinged. I can’t believe he’s allowed to operate this way as a United States President.   A democratic would never be able to miss a beat, much less act indecisively with world leaders.",mlineras,2025-04-09T16:30:19,8
This is nothing more than insider trading in stock manipulation. Trump said he only buys on the stock market is bad and sells when the stock is at at a high.He sent a tweet saying buy stocks now,uiuc-liberal,2025-04-09T17:45:24,3
"I think it makes perfect sense now--it's pure market manipulation for his own economic gain. Utterly criminal, but you know not a thing will happen to him.",Awkward-Abrocoma-660,2025-04-09T17:42:13,3
You know maybe Dump hates DEI cause then he cant be the absolute idiot he naturally is without looking bad.,MaximusDM22,2025-04-09T17:34:58,3
"I really don't like the take that everything Trump does is rational or benefits him or his people. He can't be incompetent and a mastermind at the same time. It's tempting to say this was market manipulation, but there are much easier ways he can do it if he wants to. For example, he can go after individual companies. Those are way easier to move than entire markets.",Gator1523,2025-04-09T18:16:22,1
"True. Everyone just agrees with him. I think there is something much larger at play here, nevertheless.",mlineras,2025-04-09T19:27:46,1
"I don't believe in absolutes. I also think that, despite his incompetence, there are still people that advise him and sometimes he listens to them (if he thinks it will benefit him). In this case, there's quite a bit of evidence that it was planned, including the tweet to buy right before he announced the tariffs.",Awkward-Abrocoma-660,2025-04-10T11:58:24,1
