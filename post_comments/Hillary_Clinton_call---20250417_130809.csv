"Interesting. I believe we forgot she resigned from being Secretary of State after the lies about Bengazi started to unravel.    Ambassador Stevens was murdered on her watch and available resources to potentially come to their aid were  instructed to stand down.

"What's crazy is the DNC is choosing, as it's ""poster child"" for it's Anti-Trump agenda, an illegal immigrant who is likely a MS-13 gang member and terrorist, who beats up women. An illegal immigrant who was caught up in a murder investigation and had multiple restraining orders put out on him.   This is the best the DNC could come up with to try to win the 2026 Mid Terms?   One demographic that Democrats held onto in the 2024 general election was young white college educated women. And they think the best way to keep appealing to that group is to fully back a wife beater?   Seriously, when does the pure crazy from the left ever end?",TheLaughingRhino,2025-04-17T22:44:14,44
