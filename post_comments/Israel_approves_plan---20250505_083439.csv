"A lot of people don't realize that the British territory of ""Palestine"" (prior to 1948) had a population of 1.7 Million people. However, around 700K of that population was Jewish and Christian.   The current ""Palestinian"" population of the Palestinian territories (i.e., Gaza and the West Bank) is approaching 6 Million -- increasingly every year after every year (with only the 1970 census showing a decrease of 6,206 people). Thus, the entire population is about one-third of the population of the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area.   So, the idea that Israel is committing ""genocide"" is ridiculous. Populations being targeted for ""genocide"" don't grow. The entire Palestinian population in 1990 was 2.1 Million. In 35 years, the population is approaching a near tripling of that population. This is a much higher rate of population growth than Israel.   So, if someone brings up ""genocide against Palestine,"" someone else should point this out.",chrismireya,2025-05-05T10:00:02,44

"Agreed; and it's all the more aggravating when you note that Netanyahu's government actively favored Hamas for years - [right-leaning Israeli source](https://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Netanyahu-Money-to-Hamas-part-of-strategy-to-keep-Palestinians-divided-583082) and [left-leaning Israeli source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/for-years-netanyahu-propped-up-hamas-now-its-blown-up-in-our-faces/) and [Canadian source](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/netanyahu-israel-gaza-hamas-1.7010035) in case anyone is skeptical.  I wish more people would study the history of this conflict more deeply, because the more you learn about it, the more appalling it is for the US to be funding it. Netanyahu's government had the funding, knowledge, and means to fully prevent what happened, and instead they chose to not only tolerate the continued existence of Hamas, but *support Hamas* to further their own political gain, and now the Israeli people, Palestinian people, and US taxpayers are all paying the price. All to further the political ambitions and agenda of a small group of people who definitely don't have their own citizens' best interests at heart.  We need to stop seeing this conflict as Israel vs. Palestine and start seeing it for what it is: Netanyahu's Government and Hamas vs. the Israeli and Palestinian people, with US taxpayers being very gullible financial victims as well as unwitting accomplices in it.

Neither of these governments (if you can call Hamas a ""government"") are popular.  And full disclosure, I say this with Jewish roots and close friends and extended family who are Israelis and served in the IDF. This stuff is common knowledge but somehow evades heavy discussion in the mainstream US media for reasons that elude me.

"You do realize that what Iran and their proxies have been doing has just been a dry run on what they would love to do to the US? Do you know who the  major players of Oct. 7 were? I’lll give you a little lesson. The 4 players were Hamas, then Iranian Revolutionary Guard, Al Qaeda, and the Taliban/Haqanni Network. Some of those should be familiar. Especially the people who did the planning. The attack was planned by the Taliban and Al Qaeda, who includes Hamza Bin Laden, who actually isn’t dead. We need to nip this in the butt before it becomes a problem. We should be glad Trump was president, because we had a problem of legitimate terrorist coming across the border, and not just foreign gang bangers.  Hamza Bin Laden is the one who has been plotting an attack on the US to avenge his father’s dead. So you can say he’s highly motivated.  https://www.themirror.com/news/world-news/osama-bin-ladens-dead-son-691261.amp  https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/osamas-dead-son-is-alive-leading-al-qaida-in-afghanistan-and-has-terrifying-plans/articleshow/113321102.cms  It’s the saying. Born too late to deploy to the middle east, born too early to deploy to the middle east, born right on time to be deployed to the middle east.  But the OP is right.

"Sometimes reality isn't pretty. And it would not be the first, or even 100th time a major world leader had acted against the best interest of his people. This is ultimately why I believe in small government: I don't trust a government to act in the best interest of the people.  It's also not ""the whole world"" that is going along with it. The US has been pretty isolated from the world in the amount of money we funnel into the conflict, as well as our ""you can do whatever you want"" attitude towards the Israeli government. We provide the overwhelming majority of military aid, Germany provides a significant chunk, and the contributions of other countries are pretty negligible. Recently, even allies such as Spain and France which have historically provided military aid to Israel, have halted their aid. The US is also often isolated in our UN ambassador's votes in matters regarding Israel.  So really, it's only a certain subset of the US mainstream political establishment that has gotten roped into things. And it's not even all of them. For example, [Rand Paul broke from other senators to vote for increased oversight to US military aid to Israel](https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/article284335424.html), along with a few Democrats (Sanders sponsored that proposal. When Sanders and Rand Paul can agree on something, which is rare, I tend to agree with them.)  IMHO the ""absurd"" thing here is how many people are okay with giving Israel arms with no oversight whatsoever. It's especially hypocritical considering how many of these same people are crying foul about doing the exact same thing with Ukraine, and yet won't apply the same logic here. If anything, there is even less oversight of aid to Israel than aid to Ukraine. Like look at [GAO's recommendations back from 1991](https://www.gao.gov/products/nsiad-91-169) and note that GAO made 6 recommendations for oversight and US congress implemented *none* of them. How many years have gone by and nothing has changed? There aren't even any contemporary documents on GAO about aid to Israel, because they don't monitor anything. They don't have enough about Ukraine aid (IMHO) but they at least have [something](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-106884). Have they published any overview at all of Israeli aid since 1978? It's like they don't track it at all.",cazort2,2025-05-06T07:30:25,2

"Your history class has tricked you. Ww2 was more aptly bank war 2, and it did everything to help the banks and nothing but hurt the people.   If you think ww2 was some kind of glorious victory or heroic event then you have been fooled. All the great evils defeated were exaggerated, all the tragedies masterminded by the same people on all sides.    The central bank, the same one that caused ww1 and the great depression, instigated and funded ww2 on literally every side.   Each side was soaked in propaganda to make their enemies seem horrible, and their side seem glorious. Fodder and slop to make people sacrifice their lives willingly.    It was literally ""1984""'s eternal war, ruled over by the pigs from animal farm.    Each nation was nearly identical socialst systems with no meaningful differences. There was no capitalist nation, our constitution was shredded in 1913.   The war just culled the brave and able bodied men and set us up for a century of slavery.    It was a disaster, made worse by us intervention. History is written by the victors, and taught to the victims, and you bought it hook line and sinker.",trufin2038,2025-05-06T12:23:59,0

This is not a good argument.   The relationship with Israel is one of high trust given that they are a western culture that share our values. Most foreign aid does not come with extreme oversight.   The Israelis are constantly subjected to unfair oversight. They have been uniquely singled out amongst nations for their actions.   I see no reason to add more oversight on top of that given the propaganda campaigns against them. ,Texas103,2025-05-07T21:13:28,1

In your first comment you said ""it seems there is more war than ever"". What a ridiculous statement. When you look at the long term, we are pretty much living in one of the most peaceful eras in human existence. Yes, there are wars currently going on, but the vast majority of countries in the world are living in peace with each other right now. Part of this is because of eradicating the threat of evil dictators and conquerors in past wars that the US has engaged in.
