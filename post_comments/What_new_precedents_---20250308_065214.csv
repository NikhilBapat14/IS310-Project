"I think that this could be harder for democrats to harness than most breaks in norms.  Democrats generally want the government to do things, which requires explicit appropriations from congress. Trumps is mostly stopping things, and there's an argument about if the congressional budget requires the executive to spend money or if it just authorizes them to do so. It probably depends on the wording of the budget that's passed, and I've never actually read one (might vary by line item? I dunno, those things are often 800+ pages of legalese).  Trump's creation of a new department might let them move around discretionary funds and explicitly set up a department for what they want to do, though. That might give the dems the ability to put forth a more coordinated effort on things that would have been handled ad hoc in the past.  One other area they might be able to get away with is appointing more extreme cabinet members when they control both the presidency and the senate by pointing at Trump's appointees.",Sarmq,2025-03-09T10:13:08,14

Example: They supposedly stand for ""law and order"" but they support the Jan 6 insurrection where congress was physically attacked.  They also criticize the peaceful ""Black Live matter"" demonstrations but they support Jan 6 attack.  Trump also said they would cut funding at schools for ""illegal"" demonstrations - but what more illegal than the Jan 6 attacks in which an officer was killed?

"Trump set a precedent during his first term that the Biden administration could have taken advantage of too. He was given full immunity before even being elected this time, which means Biden had full immunity as well. He could have demanded a full hand recount, declared martial law—no one could have stopped him.   The problem is, Democrats never fight back. I will always lean left, but after the last election and how complacent they’ve been while Trump openly drags us toward a dictatorship, I don’t trust the Democratic Party anymore. Not unless they completely revamp leadership and bring in younger, more aggressive people.   The Democratic Party is all about pomp and circumstance, always taking the high road. They believe that if they just play fair, the other side will do the same. But that’s never going to happen.",Careless-Awareness-4,2025-03-09T14:30:33,2
"The difference between Democrats and Trumpworld is that Democrats believe in the government's power to improve lives. Trumpworld wants to destroy the government. Trumpworld (the billionaires, Bannon,  Miller, etc.) HATE the government's general mission the last 60+ years to ensure America's promises to all its citizens. Whether it's women's rights, gay rights, Black and Brown rights, non Christian rights, worker's rights. they HATE the liberalism that has been infused through the federal government. That's why anti DEI, getting rid of the Department of Ed, denying funds to USAid and Columbia, firing minority military personnel and ignoring the rights of federal workers had to be undertaken so dramatically and quickly. They HATE anyone other than wealthy. white, heterosexual, Christian males having any type of say in the direction/priorities/culture of this country. So, destroying government is easy when you don't want it to stay in its current form anyway.    But, Democrats are different. The vast majority of the leaders of the Democratic Party benefitted from the last 60 years.  They would not institute the same draconian types of cutting and firing because the policies they want to implement are supposed to be for the people. If they want any buy-in, then Democrats need to at least appear they're listening and responding to the people. Trumpworld is implementing policies for themselves and their priorities. They don't care if any regular Americans else like them. Regular americans are part of  the problem in their eyes, something MAGA world doesn't seem to understand.",Mztmarie93,2025-03-09T14:40:35,1

"I wouldn't call these current actions setting precedents so much as shamelessly ignoring precedent (and the constitution), which I would not really support emulating anyways, unless it were toward an end that reduces presidential powers and enforces more overall oversight and consequences for ignoring the law.  In terms of legal maneuvering, it's not particularly new, it's mostly just governing by EO since there is perma-gridlock in congress. The difference is that (R) has scotus in their pocket for many issues and (D) does not.   Instead of copycatting the (R)s and doing a bunch of progressive anti-Trump EOs, the left should instead work on fixing the root causes of the broken government (i.e. increasingly distorted representation through electoral collage and congressional districts that have not adjusted to population shifts, vote suppression, campaign finance law, etc) because until the government actually reflects the will of the people again, the whole system is rigged against the left for the foreseeable future.",peetnice,2025-03-09T17:24:03,1

They also have made it normal to scream 'racist' or 'fascist' at anyone who disagrees with you, and to downplay assassination and justify arson and looting depending on your political allegiance.",mskmagic,2025-03-10T04:25:48,1

"I honestly think its less of brand new precedents as a return to 100 years ago.     decades and decades ago the ""idea"" that the head of a branch of government could reorganize that branch, including downsizing was totally normative.      Though Bill Clinton fired some 300K employees,  he did it in a longer drawn out process that had a study and went through congress, which put into American's mind that was normal, and the only way to do it.      Calling Zelensky a dictator  is new / sorta,  Politicians call Xi and Kim Jung Un names , but those are ""enemy"" governments.      I'm not sure if Trump is the more drastic change, or the chicken little reporting is the bigger change.   The media just can't report on Trump fairly and objectively.    either we get fox saying how great his moves are, or msnbc saying how he's destroyed everything.  very little objective reporting when he's in office.",discourse_friendly,2025-03-10T12:14:47,1
"For decades we have been told that 'Single Payer Healthcare' is impossible because it would disrupt the economy and destroy are healthcare system.

We can now see that Republicans not only don't want to make Healthcare better, they want to kill the system entirely, sending millions of Americans into poverty when they get sick.   The argument is over for a generation, because anyone who dares try to cry socialism will be reminded of that time they had absolute control of government and used it to take away health care from millions of Americans including children and veterans.",orionsfyre,2025-03-10T14:44:38,1

"Democrats will not regain power.  They may accidentally come to it, as Joe Biden did in 2020 because of how badly COVID destroyed the economy and peoples' basic ability to function, and the Trump admin bungled that to all hell, unsurprisingly.  But Democrats have proven incapable of taking action. They cannot prosecute enemies of the state.  They are out of touch, they constantly fight with one another, and they are incapable of seeing the reality of their own party.    Perhaps most important is that they cannot ""fight dirty"" like Trump and always have to take the high road, whatever that means.  Sorry to say but the high road is the losing road, and if you want to save your country from fascism, you'll have to throw a few punches.    Any future elections they win, assuming we have fair elections in the future, will be by pure voter dissatisfaction with Republicans.

"It's this. If you look at the things he's doing, he's smashing systems.   Even in his first term, immigration laws didn't change all that much (that is, more than any normal candidate). What he did was tear down a lot of the systems that made it easy to process requests.   People get up in arms about how Democrats never go scorched earth even when they have power. But they are constantly trying to build things, which requires allocation of funds, which requires Congress. And then you've got Democrats in the house in purple districts for whom voting for that many new funds would mean losing their seat.   One of the few things Biden tried to do by subtraction was student loan forgiveness. ""Not collecting payments"" is absolutely an inaction that would help millions of Americans and boost the economy.

"Correct. The OP's question assumes the Republicans would act in good faith. History has proven they do not. For example, Mitch McConnell fabricated a ""rule"" in 2016 that the Senate wouldn't confirm a Supreme Court nominee—or even give them a hearing—during an election year. Of course, the purpose of this fake, made-up ""rule"" was to justify denying a hearing to a Democratic Supreme Court nominee because the election was *eight months away* and maybe Trump would win. Of course, in 2020, McConnell had no problem ditching the fake, made-up rule he invented so that he could ram Amy Coney-Barrett's confirmation through the Senate *two weeks* before the election, because there was a fear Trump might lose.   You may also wish to examine the works of John Yoo, a Bush administration lawyer (the author of the ""torture memos""), which reveal his belief that a Democratic president has practically no power at all, but a Republican president has almost limitless power.  And of course, the evergreen notion that when the president is a Democrat, he is completely and solely responsible for the economy—but only when it's doing badly—and when the president a Republican, he's only responsible for the economy when it's doing well.

He can't solve the issues he screams about and he wouldn't if he could. But he can make people angry about them, and that's all he wants to do.  3) ICE acts with complete disregard for the law, and this I do know personally.
