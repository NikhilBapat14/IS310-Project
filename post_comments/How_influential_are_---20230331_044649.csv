The popularity of political cartoons will reflect their ability to resonate with a particular audience. I doubt that they are by themselves influential in shifting anyone's political position.,eeeking,2023-04-02T14:25:33,3
">This means that unlike Ben Garrison, Carlos Latuff enjoys governmental endorsement.  No. Zhang Meifang is just a diplomat and they repost a bunch of stuff on their twitter.  The fact that the cartoon is nearly 14 years old should tell you that they probably got the image from a secondary source, and aren't endorsing Carlos Latuff.  If they did, they probably would link directly to his actual twitter.",Naliamegod,2023-04-03T05:53:04,3
"As a Brazilian college student you'll see a lot of his cartoons around campus and throughout your academic life, specially if you hang out with the left-wing political activists a lot.   But even though I'm generally left-leaning, I'm usually not a big fan of his work because they tend to over-simplify very complex stuff about international politics. I like it more when his work is aimed at Brazilian politics and society, like police brutality in Rio de Janeiro, for instance.  But anyways, at least in Brazil universities and left-wing/communist groups are pretty much the only place where you'll see his cartoons. Don't know about anywhere else in the world. Actually I didn't even know he was known outside of Brazil.",TheSirion,2023-04-04T11:56:11,2

Actually I didn't even know he was known outside of Brazil.  I've been aware of Carlos Latuff for almost 10 years now. I've had edgy high school classmates post his cartoons on their Facebook.   I assumed he was aiming not for a Brazilian audience but an international one because his cartoons are in English?",[deleted],2023-04-09T07:35:11,1
"It's probably both, I guess. Maybe the place your classmates take his cartoons from is specific for an international audience so it would be pointless to post Brazil-specific content, but who knows",TheSirion,2023-04-09T08:18:30,2
