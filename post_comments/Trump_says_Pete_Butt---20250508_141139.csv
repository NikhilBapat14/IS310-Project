He's just jealous because his own wife doesn't even want to hold his hand in public.,madbiscotti,2025-05-08T14:19:22,18

Absolutely pathetic that a sitting United States president insults another politician for being gay and his party will do nothing to challenge or disapprove.,rogozh1n,2025-05-08T14:23:24,9

"Someone in control of trump is worried about Pete.   Really like the guy and I advise everyone to watch his flagrant interview. Not a fan of the show or host but they had some decent questions and I believe brought up some interesting ideas of why the dems loss. As bs as the reasons why they lost and what they thought the dems should do sounded, I believe they are probably right. It boiled down to blatantly lying so idk where to go from there but that’s beside the point.  Regardless Pete seems like a great candidate, that is likable, well spoken, and really grounded overall. Seems like he has a lot of personal and real world experience that could help make him a real great president.",AcidRohnin,2025-05-08T15:33:21,5

Scott Bessent should do the decent thing and resign in protest.,crazybones,2025-05-08T15:46:37,3
Why would they challenge or disapprove? It works. It's probably the most effective tool they have and all it takes to use it is the absence of decency.,kylew1985,2025-05-08T16:25:39,1

There were polls last July that had Buttigieg doing considerably better than pretty much every other possible Democrat including Biden and Harris especially in swing states if he was going to run.,Cuppa-Tea-Biscuit,2025-05-08T15:51:56,5
"Most of that's about money, of course. If Satan himself appeared in a puff of sulfurous smoke and expressed an interest in bankrolling Project 2025, Trump and his Heritage Foundation buddies would decide that hey, we may be anti-demon in principle, but for this fine gentleman, we can make an exception. That said, I have a hunch that a gay man who effectively purchases sexual access to hot young sugar-baby boytoys is somehow less offensive to Project 2025 folks than a gay man in a loving, equitable partnership.",tinfoil-sombrero,2025-05-08T15:18:18,1
Only absolute trash would support an administration that considers their existence to be wrong.  I hate people who put their greed above helping those like themselves.,rogozh1n,2025-05-08T15:51:42,4
what are YOU doing? Get over here and help our asses out if you're going to fling shit. No one can afford to take off work to protest or go on strike. Protests also do NOTHING. Believe me we are all open to suggestions that ideally do not result in getting our heads blown off.,Kid_Charlamagne36,2025-05-08T15:20:40,-2
I knew he was a big contender but really haven’t seen a ton about him up until recently.  I think he should keep on doing interviews and people who know of him should continue to spread info about him. I wish I knew of him sooner so I trying to point to things I’ve seen of him recently that I think a lot of people would enjoy as well. Dudes really great imo.,AcidRohnin,2025-05-08T15:55:25,2
"I'd vote for Pete. I would have voted for him over Biden in 2020. He's intelligent, sensible and seems to give a shit about people.",kylew1985,2025-05-08T16:26:44,2
"Nah, Thiel and Musk are getting their Butterfly Revolution as much as Project 2025 is. They even have their “CEO” of their future society at the number 2 spot behind Trump. Thiel is getting his money back, Greenland might be for them. He may have gotten revenge on Ivanka for blocking him last term. He may also be taking care of those damaged in his wake with Hulk and WWE getting a rewrite of history especially since he used them for his revenge against Gawker.   Seems like more than money. They want you to not see it.",Morepastor,2025-05-08T15:51:58,2
"What am I doing? I’m a Canadian who is being affected by all of this shit going on and I had nothing to do with it. What am I doing? Only buying Canadian, Mexican, and many others products aside from rump country. products. I’m cheering you on from where I am (I used to love america but you won’t catch me visiting any time soon) but I’m getting sick of rumps shitty behaviour after shitty behaviour and I only see the people who didn’t vote for him pissing and moaning.   Sorry  I’m a bit sensitive because I’m being laid off soon due to your mess.   Honestly I don’t think you can afford to not take time off work because likely many of you won’t have it in the near future, if a Canadian can lose their job because of the orange piss stain than so can you. I agree with the fucks that were elected (or not even elected) that protests will do little to affect them. You guys have to do something serious soon before you lose all of your rights and freedoms. What suggestions do I have? Well many banana republics and other countries with despots had the people overthrow them, and these are people who had less to lose than americans. Pretending that what you have right now isn’t that bad so you continue on with my normal suburban life because You can break free from this, you do have the power.   If you dither for too long he will have so much more power and you will never break free from his control. He will run again and win, after that one of his kids or cronies will pretend to win and you will never be free.",new_mutants_82,2025-05-08T15:50:13,2
"Trump’s been taking rando pot shots at Buttigieg since 2019, and Buttigieg has positioned himself in pretty much every way to be the opposite of Trump.  https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/buttigieg-laughs-off-trump-calling-him-alfred-e-neuman-59581509946  If you see footage of Buttigieg playing the piano, he even has large hands.",Cuppa-Tea-Biscuit,2025-05-08T15:59:48,4
That’s a great clip. Thanks for sharing it.  Dude seems sharp. Still not a huge fan of Fallon though but that’s beside the point lol.,AcidRohnin,2025-05-08T16:07:55,1
