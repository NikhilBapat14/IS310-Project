I give up... this is fucking illegal and fucking congress just sits there...,SAJ-13,2025-05-01T13:41:21,27
A government agency has been discovered to be responsible for creating a series of web domains meant to promote President Trump’s recent “exclusive invitation” to break bread with the commander-in-chief for top buyers of his new cryptocurrency offering.

"How is this not illegal? Can we not shut down this crypto currency that Trump is clearly using to leverage the power of the executive branch to enrich himself?  And now using the government itself to do it?! This is so frustrating.   Have we made America great again, maga? /smh",Strict_Inspection285,2025-05-01T13:50:40,5
"At some point all this money flowing around into Trump and his cronies pockets must be coming from somewhere.  Is it unlucky billionaires that haven’t hooked up with Trump or every day people via  means I’m unsure of?  I realize the tariffs are destroying wealth in general, but it seems likely people are gaming the system in conjunction with Trump’s grifts to the detriment of some group.  The stock market seems to be defying gravity this week, so I just don’t understand how any of this works.",KidKilobyte,2025-05-01T13:53:54,2

"I gave up the minute I see most articles frame whats happening as ""entertainment"", like ""oh that silly trump just did this!"" and the remaining articles speak as if this is the new normal and how to adjust. Since news moves so fast, our attention spans and memories are shot, and everyone uses humor to not take anything serious anymore, I expect us to continue until its too late to stop it. Not trying to be a doomer but what I'm seeing in regards to reactions to this, that reach the masses, even outside of compromised mainstream media just feels like another atrocity we remember in a week but then adjust to and wait for the next. It feels like waiting for the next active school shooter headline and seeing what the deathcount is that time.",Clownsinmypantz,2025-05-01T14:52:02,1
