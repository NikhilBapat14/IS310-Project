"Trump-Theatre  He's like that dinkleberry-diaper-boy who throws plates off the counter, after getting disciplined for throwing food off his plate.  Dinkleberry-diaper-boy has a dinkleberry hanging out of his diaper.  He stinks.  Nobody wants to even look at him, much less admit where the stink is coming from.",XSinTrick6666,2025-04-25T15:41:44,4
How do you obstruct justice if they aren't even using warrants?  They are literally just searching for brown people to interrogate.,thingsorfreedom,2025-04-25T17:25:20,2

What will happen here is that the 48 hour news cycle for Trump will end up as a backdraft fire in his face.  Kash deleting the X post is just the beginning.,TintedApostle,2025-04-25T16:11:10,5
"From what I’m seeing, people are upset because they think her arrest, by the FBI no less, was an overreaction or otherwise not appropriate for this situation, since she’s a judge and not an ordinary person.   It’s also suspicious that Patel, director of the FBI, made a tweet abt the arrest initially at around 7 am before deleting it, then posting the same tweet at around noon. Source: https://gizmodo.com/fbi-director-deletes-tweet-about-arrest-of-wisconsin-judge-but-its-unclear-why-2000594375  Whatever the verdict may be, it feels like there’s a lot that’s not said yet.   Edit: Seth Abramson made a bluesky thread explaining the legality of all this: https://bsky.app/profile/sethabramson.bsky.social/post/3lnnhgymozs2w",ShadowNacht587,2025-04-25T16:13:16,7
