"The F-35 program is the single most successful military procurement program of the modern era.  That is not exaggeration.  An F-35 now costs *less* than a modernized F-15. There are more F-35s than all other stealth aircraft from all other countries in the world, *combined*. And that *includes* all the rest of US stealth aircraft.  Sabotaging the F-35 program has been an explicit goal of Russia and China for years, now. It is the single most impactful platform in any potential conflict for the next probably 30 years.  Anyone trying to sink the F-35 program can only conceivably be doing it because they are actively working in the interests of a hostile foreign power.",HerbaciousTea,2025-04-28T21:33:44,225
How can a fighter jet be woke ?,CityofTroy22,2025-04-28T21:19:16,45

"> Every single day, @LockHeedMartin, a company increasingly obsessed with pushing a woke agenda, is delivering F-35 fighter jets that are simply not ready for combat.  > Could it be that Lockheed has been too busy prioritizing Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion (DEI) initiatives& hiring anti-Trump lobbyists instead of focusing on building reliable aircraft?  Holy shit, what a god damn caricature.   Right, Lockheed Martin, the notoriously ""woke"" defense contractor.   Nevermind that the F-35 is one of the world's top fighter jets, the real problem here is all of these hysterical, increasingly unhinged, right-wing contrarians who are chronically online, insulated from reality, and consuming a steady stream of culture war propaganda to the point where they're blaming every outlandish or made up problem on ""DEI"" and ""wokeness.""",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-04-28T22:28:15,16
