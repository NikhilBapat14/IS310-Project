"The situation in a nutshell:  Congressmen complaining about a program they passed years ago, and had 20 years to remove or reverse, are now whining that its being implemented because politics.",DingbattheGreat,2025-04-17T17:12:21,123
REAL ID was a thing while Biden was still in office...,Zerogates,2025-04-17T17:34:18,24
"20 years, giving states plenty of time to implement. and ..i imagine all drivers licenses would have required an in person renewal to get real id in twenty years.  Not understanding the push back from conservatives",SerendipitySue,2025-04-17T17:19:55,45
"Massie is embarrassing himself again. Real ID is just a drivers license with enough verified documentation behind it to prove your identity. Do you want to go back to fake IDs, high degree of variance in security of DLs from various states? Do you have an issue with Passports, which have the same level of security behind them as Real ID DLs?",jcr2022,2025-04-18T01:46:43,8
Requiring identification to be accurate is a problem for some reason?,Mountain_Man_88,2025-04-17T18:03:22,10
"Massie is exhausting. Anything positive that could be said about him is outweighed by how bad he is on immigration. If you can't get that right, then none of your other opinions have real world relevancy. The migrants being imported will never support libertarianism or ""classic liberalism.""",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-17T18:49:14,4
"Not only was it passed so long ago, but nothing about the current system prevents them from having a database of every person with an ID, including photo, facial recognition, etc.   The states already share that whether you have real id or not. Thats how a cop that pulls you over 10 states away form your own can look up your DL, check for warrants, etc.  REAL ID is just about proving through a chain of documents  that you are who you say you are and a chain of verification steps happened. Basically everything we want as a pre-requesite to a national voter ID.  I don't get the outrage from some people on our side the past few weeks.",trs21219,2025-04-17T20:53:17,30
Arizona only requires an ID be renewed once you turn 99. I’m sure there’s others like that too. ,anubis2051,2025-04-17T17:22:25,8

Only for those too lazy to get it. Sounds like the argument against voter ID.,social_dinosaur,2025-04-17T18:34:49,9
I guess they forgot the time with COVID the media reported people in the southern states were  being unsafe by traveling around too much and ignoring government “recommendations”.  They showed proof by displaying cell phone ping data.,DingbattheGreat,2025-04-17T21:04:07,6
"Much like the left, there are people on the right that are never happy unless they are perpetually outraged. It's kind of the Horseshoe Theory in action.",VerusPatriota,2025-04-18T06:35:25,2

He may as well call himself a Libertarian,social_dinosaur,2025-04-17T18:02:51,3
He certainly has Libertarian impulses as evidenced by his voting record.  Though I think sometimes he just pulls out his magic 8 ball for voting advice.,SeemoarAlpha,2025-04-17T19:20:11,3
"LOL, that's funny. It's hard to pin him down as any particular flavor of politician. I'll have to go to his website one day and see how he describes himself.",social_dinosaur,2025-04-17T19:34:05,2
