what's farfetched about it? they're doing it right now in front of our eyes,l0ktar0gar,2025-03-06T09:09:30,100
"Shutting down the government by cutting off funding is not the same as collapsing the US government.  Either way, the answer is yes.  A single political party can completely collapse the US government.  All it takes is for someone to claim they are a unitary executive and for that person's party to control congress and the supreme court.    Sound familiar?  That's because this is exactly what republicans are doing right now.  The republican congress is sitting by idly while the republican president is violating the constitution to levy tariffs, cut congressionally created departments/spending, etc.  It remains to be seen if the republican court will stand by and let this all happen.  But the courts cannot enforce anything, they don't have an army that can force the republican president to comply with their rulings.  Indeed, the republican court already gave the republican president authorization to violate any law, so it's no shock to see the lawless republican president speed running the collapse of the US government.  To what end we can only speculate.",JDogg126,2025-03-06T08:30:21,222

"I believe we are seeing an attempt to do so right now in the US.  As Federal systems are attacked and disabled by the Trump administration I predict that there will be a follow on attempt to replace the services with privatized versions.  This strongly parallels what happened under Putin with many Putin cronies being rewarded and Oligarchs being created.  The US is following the Putin template for domination and corruption.  Maybe we haven't reached the point of ""[Constitutional Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_crisis)"" yet but the very idea of ""by the people and for the people"" is definitely being attacked and eroded right now.  Way too many Republicans believe they are simply supporting some pet cause and have completely lost any perception of the ""big picture"".",rgc6075k,2025-03-06T09:11:10,21
It isn't far-fetched and you're watching it happen in real-time as part of the Project 2025 road-map.

"Yes, a single party can collapse America from the inside.     It would be difficult. Said party would need to continuously erode norms over many decades of effort, creating an environment so partisan that normal checks and balances would stop to apply.   They’d then need to win over the courts. This isn’t as simple as just appointing favored judges to the Supreme Court, a destructive party would need a vetting system to actually determine which judges have the political bias to rule in their favor and the corruption to continue to be swayed by gifts and bribes during a decades long tenure on the highest court.  Once that vetting system is in place, they’d need to win the Presidency at strategic times to place the maximum number of Justices on the court, ideally having enough influence to force retirements.     This is where step one is important. In a non-partisan environment, a partisan judge might get blocked in favor of a competent one. But in a partisan environment, might makes right. It becomes much easier to spend political capital violating norms to make sure your opponents don’t get appointments, while steamrolling your own picks.   With the courts secured, they’d need to focus on other institutions. They’d need to attack traditional non-governmental institutions that serve as a check to the government’s influence: media, academia, and churches. A single social movement is unlikely to sway all three of these, so it would be better to convert one or two and attack the others.   Finally, the last obstacle is the federal bureaucracy. The single biggest roadblock to creating the conditions necessary for a collapse is the massive and old meritocracy that runs counter to the normal partisan comings and goings in government. This needs to be dismantled.  The courts need to exert their oversight over federal agencies, and non-partisan bureaucrats need to be replaced with partisan loyalists at every turn.     This includes the military, which might in a last dying gasp try something like a coup to stop the total collapse of the country. But if a party focuses hard enough on recruiting young men, and replaces any non-loyalists at the top of the chain of command, there won’t be enough momentum from either the top or the bottom to pull off anything like a military coup.   With every piece of Exodia unlocked, a party bent on the destructive collapse of the country would then need to use the power they’ve unlocked.   This would involve things like attacking allies, giving intelligence to enemy nations, and selling off public assets.  These actions would weaken the country financially, militarily, and diplomatically.  It is crucial to attack each pillar of strength: leaving one pillar alone will reinforce the others and make it less likely for a total collapse.   Of course, this would be difficult. It would take decades of effort, involve the subversion of many separate bodies that should naturally be checking each other, and would require people at the top willing to sell out the country for personal gain. It’s highly unlikely that this particular combo would appear and persist through the multiple generations it would take to set up the conditions necessary for a sudden collapse.  ",ManBearScientist,2025-03-06T11:54:37,9

"Interesting question, and I fear the answer is YES. The senior military are almost totally committed to defending the Constitution, but Trump seems to have found enough lackies to replace all the service chiefs and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the rank and file has been ""conservative"" since Nixon ended the draft. So at best a 50/50 chance ""the Marines"" would come to our rescue.  Congress has the power of the purse, but Republicans are determined to use it to destroy  foreign aid, Social Security, ADA, Medicare and Medicare and end taxation entirely for the very rich. Its a very short ste for them to just agree to burn the place down and see what happens.  The Courts have been filled with neocon's for the past 50 years as Republicans block appointments of everyone left of center-right, and Trumpmusk has simply ignored the courts for the last 6 weeks and is unlikely to change that stance.",Olderscout77,2025-03-06T15:59:12,4

"First, you have to define what you mean by collapse. In my mind there are two scenarios in which we could consider the failure of the American republic.   First is that it becomes Federal policy to maintain political ideals that align with the reigning political party, regardless of whether at the local, state, or federal level. Here in Tennessee, we are already seeing signs of this taking form as our state house has made it illegal to vote for any bill that supports sanctuary city policies.   Second would be a series of secessions to the point that the union would be considered failed. This has happened before already in the form of the U.S. civil war, however, the remaining union states dod not dissplve the union and were able to organize and militarily re-conquer the seceded states.

"Democrats should disconrinue their policy of aversion to sowing doubt in elections and the presidency, and instead take comprehensive action against the Trump anti-democracy dictatorship agenda.  The election annulment of Georgescu in Romania for foreign interference, the impeachment of Yoon in South Korea for posse commtatus, the indictment of Bolsonaro in Brazil for a j6-like coup attempt, and the protests against Kavelashvili in Georgia for anti-NATO corruption, should be done to Donald Trump who is guilty of all the above.  If not by the legislative or judicial branches of the federal government, then by an alliance of democratic state governors, AGs, and state supreme courts with the popular support of USA citizens.  During the American Revolution, Loyalists, Tories, and some Continentals were against democracy. Patriots, (and some Continentals), were for democracy.  In the Trump era, pro-democracy neo-patriots and neo-continentals are fighting for the future of America against the threat of anti-democracy neo-tories and neo-loyalists.  Neo-Tories, Neo-Loyalists, Neo-Confederates, and Neo-Nazis should be banned from all government offices in the USA in accordance with Amendment 14 Section 3.  Trump is obviously a Kremlin agent. Anyone who thinks Ivana Zelniçkovà and Mélanja Knàvs were just available women is extremely gullible.  Therefore, the following is a suggestion for denazification of the United States of America.   Article of Refederation of the Federal Government in Response to Insurrection, Seditious Conspiracy, Corruption, Previous Convictions, and Indictments of Donald Trump:    After the Civil War, Amendment 14 Section 3 was meant to prevent Jefferson Davis from becoming president and then allowing southern states to continue slavery via the Davis administration not working within the federal government. In that case, the Davis administration would exist as a confederate presidential administration and would require refederation.  What is required for the possible refederation of a Trump administration, that via ignoring Federal procedures becomes a dictatorship, is the alliance of 20 to 25 Democratic States of America, democrat party State Attorneys General, democrat State Supreme Courts, Pentagon generals who are on Trump's enemies list for non-loyalty to a dictator, the military bases and industries within democrat controlled states, Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, MIT, (all located in democratic party controlled states), NATO, the defense forces of European countries, also the defense forces of Canada, Australia, South Korea, and Brazil.

">Succession is starting in CA and Blue and Purple States will form a confederacy with Canada as ally  This is fiction. Even if California and some other states tried to leave the union (which is an act of insurrection and Trump likely isn't pardoning them), they would not be allowed to leave voluntarily. It be a free McDonald's meal to Trump since the federal government and military is obligated to stop insurrection. It's one of the few constitutional lawful duties the military has on US shores.   And Canada isn't going to help directly. That would require them to commit an act of war, an attack on the US.  They arent starting a war with the US. Unlike in 1812, it wouldn't end with the US burning the capital and then screwing up the rest. No, the Canadian military would be overrun in days, and since they started the war no treaty would save them. Not because they don't have allies but because the US has 5000 nukes, and as Russia and Iraq shows, that means no help is directly coming.  And I think Newsom and the rest are smart enough to know that insurrection won't play out in their favor.
