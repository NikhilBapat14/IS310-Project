"I have always admired UPS employees for their dedication, efficiency and hard work. Thanks King CHUMP, for needlessly causing 20,000 lost jobs. How low can you go until your base wakes up and figures out who you really work for?   It is absolutely vital that the Democratic party leadership stop being Trump's weak patsies, and start kicking ass and taking names. No more ""When they go low, we go high."" Our new mantra should be ""When they go low, we kick them in the face.""",Nerd-19958,2025-04-30T08:00:54,3

"I know it's chump change to people like Bezos, but these billionaires cannot be happy about this. They're losing money.

"While I'd love to pile the blame on Trump, this has been coming for a while. UPS has been drastically scaling back their Amazon shipments the past few years, while Amazon has ramped up their own delivery service.",Ianthin1,2025-04-30T11:16:59,1
"There is truth to that -- also, another relatively new delivery path is    Shipper --> UPS (or other commercial delivery service) --> Local post office who delivers the package.",Nerd-19958,2025-04-30T14:34:39,1
