Democrats should pour every dime they have into buying as many Teslas as they can and destroying each one. That'll show the world they're serious.,triggernaut,2025-05-09T07:01:37,210

People have MDS musk derangement syndrome. Sure driving over a car in a tank would be fun by itself I don’t need to make a political statement while doing it.,Bitter-Assignment464,2025-05-09T06:59:20,29
"In order to do this, they had to buy the Tesla, thereby giving Musk more money in the process.  I bet he is saying buy more Teslas to crush if you want.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-09T12:07:38,4

"I go to this pub regularly and it's usually filled with lefties. It's baffling listening their conversations which are often full of hate. The other night it was the ""I hate America"" conversation and how they wanted to move to Europe(as if the entire continent was some leftist paradise).  On the rare occasion when I do run into conservatives, I find our conversations are based around good faith arguments on practical topics.   The difference is night and day. It's sad really.",Cool_Cat_Punk,2025-05-09T09:00:22,6

Saw a guy who had his Tesla fire bombed.  It was totaled - he had an absolute blast using the insurance settlement to buy a brand new Tesla all over again.,cliffotn,2025-05-09T18:21:52,1
"Terrorism.  Makes lefties afraid of buying Teslas when other lefties are acting violently to them.  Thus harming the value of the company, thus harming Elon, to try to deter him from cutting government waste, waste that was going to these terrorists in various ways.",ChristopherRoberto,2025-05-09T10:35:20,36
