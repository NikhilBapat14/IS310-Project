"Interesting word:  > A panopticon is a prison design conceived by Jeremy Bentham where a central guard tower allows for constant surveillance of inmates in surrounding cells. The key principle is that inmates, while not continuously observed, are always aware of the possibility of being watched, leading to a self-regulating behavior. This design, while not widely built, has become a metaphor for the power of surveillance and its impact on behavior, influencing how we understand control and discipline in society.",drtolmn69,2025-04-27T11:53:14,8
