"\> ""Both the Constitution and the Consumer Product Safety Act grant the President authority to remove members of CPSC. President Trump has exercised this authority, and he has done so lawfully,"" Feldman wrote. ""CPSC remains committed to our important safety mission: protecting American consumers from the unreasonable risk of injury associated with consumer products. The Commission will continue to carry out its duties with diligence and integrity.""  That statement just sounds like bullshit and is contradicted by this .......  \> Under the federal law governing the agency, the president can remove a commissioner ""for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office but for no other cause.""  Too many gobsmacking paragraphs to quote here. I encourage anyone who's a consumer (so EVERYONE) to read this. Basically, DOGE wanted access to the agency AND its data. Within 2 days of refusing the request, the three democratic commissioners were fired. One didn't have confirmation that he was fired until he showed up for work today and was refused entry to the building.  \> Trumka wrote. ""CPSC's lifesaving work is far too important to take this lying down.""  It literally IS lifesaving work. CPSC protects consumers from injury/death due to unsafe products, such as toys that pose a choking hazard.Take a look at [https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls) .

Trump actually runs the government day to day and has control of police forces that can physically force people out of the buildings these agencies control.

"There isn't really such a thing as an ""independent agency"" in the constitution.  Independent agencies exist because previous presidents and congresses have agreed that it's a good idea to run certain things independently, and the president has kept their nose out of it to not rock the boat and not go against these ideals.  Trump on the other hand is an entirely corrupt agent and so presumably is firing these people because he or one of his donors (e.g., Musk) have been affected by the agency in the past, or are being investigated currently. Or if could be as simple as they're just perceived as ""woke"" and ""liberal"" due to past public actions (e.g., tweeting support for BLM or trans rights or something... Because this government literally has lists of people they're going after for being woke or libera [e.g., this organization maintains a list of people at DHS](https://americanaccountabilityfoundation.com/about/)l).  Trump and his Project 2025 buddies have no problem rocking the boat and they believe in ""Unitary Executive Theory"" where the president is the head of the executive so the President can do whatever he wants within the Executive branch of government, even with these ""independent"" agencies. And we've seen so far that Trump has been willing to go beyond executive authority (because he knows Congress won't impeach him) and that's why we see judges constantly striking down his executive orders.",LegDayDE,2025-05-10T06:53:54,8

"While true that independent agencies aren’t in the Constitution neither is the ability to fire members of executive office workers (the only method of firing anyone ever mentioned in the Constitution is through impeachment [this applies to more than just the President]).  This means that the ability to fire members of executive office workers was debated before the Supreme Court. Specifically, whether the President or Congress has the authority, and what limits, if any, Congress can place on who can get fired.   This is where the idea of independent agencies, as a matter of law as opposed to tradition, comes from. The comment above your current one states which case defined it; Humphrey’s Executor (which weakened a precedent, from less than 10yrs before it, that is largely where the Unitary Executive theory draws legitimacy from [UE theory is the idea that the President alone has authority over the executive. You can guess why trump’s admin loves this theory]).  There have been many cases before the SC since then that have changed the calculus since then, and have arguably weakened the precedent of Humphrey’s Executor, but the fact remains that independent agencies, as defined by the SC, have some level of protection.
