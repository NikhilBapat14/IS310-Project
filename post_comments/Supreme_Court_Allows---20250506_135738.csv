"There are all kinds of medical conditions that bar people from service. If you need major surgery you are ineligible to join, if your mental state means you are high risk you are ineligible to join. If you need regular medications you are ineligible to join. Basically anything that would make unable to deploy into austere conditions on short notice makes you ineligible. People who are transgender pretty much check all those boxes.",Darthwxman,2025-05-06T14:58:33,591

I was denied entry into the military because of a minor case of scoliosis.  The Navy didn't want to have to pay for any back surgeries if it became a problem.    People with gender dysphoria do not belong in the military.,scrapqueen,2025-05-06T14:50:05,322

When I comissioned I had to get a waiver for hearing loss that was related to enlisted **prior service** and I still almost wasn't approved. Had the VA rating letter and everything.

"The military was allowed to exclude people for not getting the Covid vaccine, under the sketchy premise that they'd somehow pose a heightened medical burden.  This should be no different.  I don't want the military wasting resources on gender affirmation, transition surgeries, and all the psychological care that invariably goes along with it.  People are free to mess with that stuff if they like, they just don't have a right to impose it on our military whose mission should be 100% around fighting, not social experimentation.",bearcatjoe,2025-05-06T20:02:08,71

I wonder what happens if someone joins the military well after they're done transitioning. so like the military won't have to pay for any surgery or anything. like if a female transitioned to a male and then joined a few years later. is that still not allowed?,burninator3343,2025-05-06T19:59:15,11
">People with gender dysphoria do not belong in the military.  One of the reason leftists are being ridiculous about this is because most of them (erroneously) no longer believe gender dysphoria is a prerequisite to identifying as T. They think the idea that someone must have gender dysphoria to be T is ""transmedicalist"", which in their parlance is ""truscum gatekeeping.""  This, of course, actually still justifies the ruling. Anyone who thinks that way is a far-left extremist, and the military prohibits extremist ideologies.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-05-06T15:49:19,66

"Like another poster above said. These people are viewing our nations military as another 9-5 government job and not the elite fighting force that it is supposed to be. We‚Äôre supposed to be able to turn on a dime and be a conquering force within 24 hours. These folks think it‚Äôs some kind of kumbaya camp where they spend 90% of their time racking up medical visits looking for a way to get out early and still collect a paycheck. I have a cousin that went through basic in 2022. He is SEVERELY overweight, to the point he struggles to tie his own shoes, and yet they graduated him. He hasn‚Äôt even been able to do his job because he‚Äôs been sitting in a unit designed for people with medical issues. How he hasn‚Äôt been separated I don‚Äôt know.
