"Republicans are a hearty bunch, they don't seem to worry much about the constitution or Trump's violations. Remember the cartoons of Obama setting fire to the constitution in front of the signers, here we are.",Anxious_Claim_5817,2025-04-30T07:04:52,5
Spare me “unnerved” concern! Republican congressmen and conservative Supreme Court justices are responsible for emboldening an out of control President and his power-hungry handlers.,ranton2,2025-04-30T07:22:28,3

GOP lawmakers could also do something about it but they won't.  Once again they expect Dems to save them from themselves.,HandsLikePaper,2025-04-30T09:09:32,1

GTFO with this ish. Until they start cosigning on articles of impeachment then I don’t want to hear from them. They’ve been complicit in this attack on our democracy.,curves-left,2025-04-30T11:49:33,1
