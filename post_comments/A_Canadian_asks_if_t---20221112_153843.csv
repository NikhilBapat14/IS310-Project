"A serious party might have a chance,  but the Libertarian party is just a grift. A serious third party contender would start by building a strong localized base,  winning seats in state governments or the House. Running for President with no government experience or other governmental representation seems downright delusional.",Unban_Jitte,2022-11-12T23:26:45,35
"The few times in US politics that a third party has come to prominence wasn't because it became a third party in competition with the existing ones- it was because one of the existing two parties imploded. The Federalist Party and the Whig Party both went down in flames rather suddenly and left a gap to be filled, which it eventually was.   The best chance for the Libertarians is if the Republican party ceases to be a major contender and people grow disaffected with a cycle or two of purely Democratic government. Somewhat conservative Democrats might hop over to take their chances in a different party, and might provide the actual policy positions to win in national politics.   Now, there have been *brief* periods where a third party got a fair amount of the vote, but that generally involved regionalism. It's unlikely that the Libertarians would have such a strong grasp on part of the country that those states start sending up Libertarian representatives. Could happen, though.",[deleted],2022-11-13T06:54:23,13
"Incredibly unlikely.  They had what was probably their best chance ever in 2016:  - Major party candidates were deeply disliked, with significant scandals, and neither had actual governing experience.  - Both the Libertarian Presidential and VP candidates were highly qualified candidates, both former governors.  Still only got slightly more than 3% of the vote.  Hard to imagine a scenario where stars align more in their favor in the near future.",houinator,2022-11-12T22:47:06,16
"No.  The Libertarians of today were the people who supported the Articles of Confederation then.  The Libertarians want the least amount of government (according to their rhetoric, not their actions) and want far more power concentrated in the States.   Today that would make the U.S. much weaker as a nation and California would dominate the nation.  The DEMs love the Libertarian party because they siphon votes from the GOP.    No third party will ever make it unless they have lots of money to work in all 50 states or at least those with the '270' history to win.  Once you introduce that kind of money, you have to worry about corruption.",Yggdrssil0018,2022-11-13T00:46:32,5
"If they ever had a chance, they sure don't anymore.  The decisively illiberal, MAGA-courting Mises Caucus (a complete disgrace to economist Ludwig von Mises' name) took over the party at all levels in 2021. They've been fatally hemorrhaging money and members ever since. Whole state affiliates have been legally disassociating themselves from the National party. Others have gone rogue and done nothing better than trollposting; the New Hampshire affiliate routinely posts (probably deliberately) shockingly racist tweets, and runs as candidates for statewide offices literal sh*tbags of human beings so bad I'd rather vote for Lauren Boebert.  The Libertarian Party will not survive as it is currently known. It will either lose its minor party status and ballot access pretty much everywhere and become an irrelevant footnote, or potentially be retaken by the liberal libertarians eventually but with 50 years' worth of institutional progress having been wiped off the map and the brand forever tarnished.",Musicrafter,2022-11-13T04:05:19,2
"Libertarianism is not a serious political philosophy, and could not be less realistic or suitable for the modern world. It's a delusional world view held largely by people who want to stick their head in the sand and pretend all the worlds problems would go away if everybody would just leave them alone.",Andynonomous,2022-11-13T10:37:40,1
"No. Duverger's law is strengthened by the presidential system.  Canada is actually pretty unique in having strong third parties with a plurality voting system. The UK has the Lib Dems, but they only really come out when the party leadership of both parties goes against popular will.",Volsunga,2022-11-12T23:46:50,0
"The question is irrelevant. With our winner take all voting, there’s to much risk in spoiling the closest 2nd party. We’ll need rank choice or similar to make 3rd party possible.",ElectronGuru,2022-11-13T00:58:52,-1
No. It's there strictly to move the Overton Window like the Green Party as well.,DMFC593,2022-11-13T00:13:26,1
"I have many friends who disliked Republicans and Democrats so decided to support Libertarians. But seeing how people responded to covid and President Trump led to all of them except 1 deciding that voting Democrat was necessary. So I'd say the past 3-7 years delayed that movement a decade or two. I wasn't Libertarian, but Johnson/Weld was the candidate I contributed to in 2016 but by election time I decided candidate Trump was too dangerous to do anything but vote Democrat.   Now I consider myself Democrat instead of independent but it isn't always easy to get excited about it. They are like Jedi...no humility and good at losing the war against the sith. There actually needs to be a counterbalance to Democrats so """"conservatives"""" selling their soul to a false idol was not ideal.  Edit: Here is the post that I always think about now when these questions come up:  https://old.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/ot9zow/shoutout_to_all_the_idiots_trying_to_prove_that/  Personally, I consider Libertarians impractical.",MrPractical1,2022-11-13T08:12:40,1
"Yes but it would take a perfect storm of manufactured events and them being more libertarian in name than policy/belief. US elections are largely driven by money, name recognition as well as how easy it is for your people to vote and how hard it is for the others to not vote.   To be successful a libertarian party would need enough money to get their people's ads in front of voters and increase name recognition of candidates and the party. Sadly policy matters less than how much you can psychologically manipulate people with attack ads and ads that galvanize your base. They'd also need enough money to buy a campaign machine that can function over years and across states.  More than anything they'd need a way to tear down the influence of the two major parties. For state seats and house seats that means finding a way to overturn gerrymandering or to at least pack their people into districts to help them win. I don't see that happening without a lot of money.",randonumero,2022-11-13T08:36:03,1
"No, that's the simple answer. The two-party system in the United States, well deeply hated by many Americans, is firmly entrenched. I would narrow this down to two factors, polarization and primaries.  Right now the United States is a deeply polarized society. That means that the stakes of losing an election are enormous for either side. Voting for a minority party like the libertarians or the greens risk splitting the vote and handing victory to the other side. Besides, with the primary system it's more efficient to run in one of the two major parties primaries then start a completely new political party.  We can see examples of this in both the Republican and Democratic parties. With the Republicans we have the libertarians themselves like Ron Paul and Justin Amash successfully defeating more traditional Republican incumbents. With the Democrats we have democratic socialists like Bernie Sanders and AOC being elected to congress through the Democratic Party.   There is no point in starting a new political party. The risk is too high of splitting your supporters' vote, and there's a more effective alternative in the form of the primaries. This all but guarantees that the two-party system is going nowhere. Given that political reality the chances of a third party taking off are all but nil.",PaleontologistOk7794,2022-11-13T10:02:23,1
"No. It would have happened by now. As it stands, Libertarians don't even take themselves seriously.   One of the best descriptions I've heard is that they are housecats - utterly assured of their fierce independence but totally dependent on a system of support.  https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/may/29/libertarian-party-chairman-candidate-strips-stage-/",pina_koala,2022-11-13T13:12:32,1
"No, it's been taken over by MAGA crazies and bares no resemblance to the original philosophy. (Do anything as long as you don't hurt people, don't steal stuff, keep government out of your personal life) there's a lot of curly cues about Big L little l libertarians, and there used to be a scale of essentially anarchist on one side and people that thought some government programs where good.  As it stands today, it's a bunch of circle jerking redhats begging to lick the boots of Trump and those like him.  Used to be one. Sad it's gone, but it's gone. Names still there but philosophy is dead and replaced with authority loving lickspitles.",Carbon_Gelatin,2022-11-13T13:20:18,1
"The electoral college really is the start of why two parties are our legacy. If the Ls were to start at the lowest level, gain momentum over the long term there might be a chance. Right now the L have to caucus with either R or D",Bryllant,2022-11-13T14:19:42,1
Libertarianism isn't a feasible governing philosophy. Some individuals may adhere to it but there's no successful modern society that uses it as a predominant political ideology.,mojo4394,2022-11-13T15:24:22,1
No. The libertarians are too anti-authority to ever have the organizational prowess necessary to make a nationally significant 3rd party. They are basically anarchists with money.,HeartwarminSalt,2022-11-13T15:36:19,1
"The way the Libertarian Party is currently constructed, it will not be able to grow into a viable 3rd party, period. There are key structural problems that prevent it from growing any further than it already has. If the Libs change those structures, they certainly could change that trajectory, but short of complete transformation of the party, no, they will always be a 2% if that party.  The main issue is that the Libs don't *really* care about getting more supporters. Sure, they put out campaign ads and all that, and have messaging that is fundamentally persuasion-focused, but the reality is that functional political parties are ground-up organizations. They start with local groups of like-minded constituents, that then meet up with other groups creating an ever-expanding network of politically-aligned people. Put another way, if the Dems or Reps wanted to push a new policy or issue, they would do so by calling ""down the chain."" Mitch McConnell or Nancy Pelosi would reach out to some key constituent groups that helped them get elected in their districts, who would then reach out to other groups *they* work with, who would then mobilize their volunteers and allies to then do additional work to appeal to *more* voters.  The Libs don't have that. The Libs don't have that base of local supporters that can engage with and persuade voters and organizations. They instead run out national candidates like Jo Jorgensen. Jorgensen had never, ever won a political race. Not a local district race, not a statewide race, not a national race. She had no local constituent groups advocating for her policies. Even if by some miracle she did manage to win the election, there was no congressional support. Did she expect Dems and Reps to just obey her policy positions because she asked them nicely?  They're literally just a grifting/fundraising organization. That's it. They don't put in the work to develop local support, which means the party can never, ever grow. They exist solely to con naive, dissatisfied folks into giving them donations. That's it.  This is even more starkly obvious considering this is actually a pretty good time, historically speaking, for third parties in the US. We've recently seen quite a bit of actual third party activity in a way that can actually lead to a real political movement. In fact, you could argue that the last several decades have seen the GOP challenged by several third parties.  For example, look at the Tea Party. By the definition used by actual political scientists, this was a third party. The Tea Party had their own branding and own political platform. They were based in local, grassroots support (yes, funded by rich people but still there were real local folks getting together to develop this new political direction). They focused on local races first, moving ""up the chain"" gradually. They primaried existing Reps and won general elections as their own brand of conservatism.  This worked. The Tea Party was an electoral force, to the point that they were even able to force the resignation of a more moderate Speaker of the House and replace him with a Tea Party sympathizer. Sarah Palin took great pains to show her ties to the movement. It was a true third party, but because the US has a rigid two party system, that's not a stable position, so they chose to use that power to crash into one of the existing parties and remake it around their image. If the US had different structures, the Tea Party and Reps never would have merged.  Trumpism is similar. Yes, Trumpism and MAGA began with a presidential run, but unlike the Libs, Trump was careful to aggressively get involved in developing local support for HIS version of conservativism even when the other party was already still present.",mormagils,2022-11-14T09:32:04,1
"I have to disagree that it was ever ""grift"". I was involved personally for a while, and I merely got the impression that the biggest problem was that there was a hyperfixation on ideological purity so acute that it often threatened both members' ability to cooperate with each other and also candidates' ability to present palatable messages to win elections. Plus, I suspect the percentage of people there with Asperger's was probably significantly higher than the average in the general population, which has obvious compounding deleterious effects on the aforementioned problems.  The party is certainly in its death throes now, but for largely unrelated reasons, namely the hostile takeover by a hard-right MAGA-courting faction that is causing the party to hemorrhage money and members and even causing it to literally splinter into pieces, with many state parties legally disassociating themselves from what they perceive as the abject dumpster fire of the national party.",Musicrafter,2022-11-13T04:13:59,8
"Hilary Clinton didn’t have ‘actual governing experience?’ You know she was Secretary of State and a SENATOR, right?   Any talk about viable third parties that doesn’t remember the Reform Party and the early 90s isn’t a serious discussion. The best chance for something like a third party victory was with Ross Perot’s campaign, and that was only because he invested in a ferocious party infrastructure down to the local level to support a bid. 2016 wasn’t even close because the Libertarian party has never invested in anything like that.",dunpyklungo,2022-11-23T08:08:46,2

">In 2016 I was a never Trump R who voted L.  That's kind of the point they were making. The Libertarian party more closely aligns with the Republicans over the Democrats, so the Libertarian party siphons votes away from the Republican party.
