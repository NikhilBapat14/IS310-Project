"Weird.  He isn't even religious.  It tells you that the white evangelical Christian nationalists want to hear what they want to hear.  They don't really care who says it.  This hasn't been unique to Trump.  Reagan was a twice-divorced non-churchgoer who courted the then-new Religious Right, and they loved him.  His rhetoric prompted them to commit to the Republicans, even though Jimmy Carter was a devout Christian.  Oddly enough, it is the non-white Christians who vote Democratic who want to see more genuine expressions of religious faith from their candidates.

"Add it to the long list of ways that the Trump administration is wiping its ass with the constitution.  That being said, let's take the time to explain *why* this is so unconstitutional, and with the added bonus of shutting down the revisionist talking point from conservatives who claim that America was ""founded on Christianity""  Our nation was not founded on religious doctrine, but enlightenment era principles that turned away from the religious authority of the church, away from the divine right of kings (looking at you Trump), away from a national religion, and towards reason, rationality and democratic ideals.  The framers relied on those principles to write our founding documents and they both challenged and feared the merging of religion and government. They rejected the Church of England and repeatedly rebuked the idea of a national religion or church.   There is substantial evidence and documentation that points to these facts:  But first, it should be noted that the Bible reveals how even Jesus Christ himself believed in the separation of church and state:  Mark 12:17, ""Jesus said to them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.""  With that out of the way, it is documented *fact* that the founders staunchly opposed the union of religion and government.  In actuality, a number of founding fathers were purported to be deists who clashed with the idea that some divine hand is meddling in our affairs. Instead, they emphasized the importance of rationality, intellect and observation in understanding nature and how society should be governed.  Thomas Jefferson is often credited with coining the phrase ""a wall of separation between church and state"" in his letter to the Danbury Baptist association.   Thomas Jefferson's metaphor became part of constitutional jurisprudence. Jefferson was later quoted by Chief Justice Morrison in Reynolds v. United States in 1878, and was famously referenced in the Supreme Court Case, Everson v. Board of Education, which interpreted the First amendment's establishment clause as intending to erect that ""wall of separation.""  Jefferson's writings have been referenced in a series of important legal cases and public debates throughout our history.   His famous words are often invoked to stress the importance of how this separation protects the rights of the people, and how it preserves the functionality of government and the virtue of religious practice. This includes protecting Americans from a repressive, governing religious authority, and guarding one's religious practice from government intervention.  Roger Williams, an early puritan minister, founder of the state of Rhode Island and the first Baptist Church in America, was the first public official to call for ""a wall or hedge of separation"" between ""the wilderness of the world"" and ""the garden of the church.""  There you have it, an early American statesman and minister‚Äîand a profound authority on the matter‚Äîacknowledging the need for this separation.   James Madison interpreted Martin Luther's ""Doctrine of Two Kingdoms"" as a conception of the separation of church and state.  During a debate in the House of Representatives, Madison also contended, ""Because if Religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large, still less can it be subject to that of the Legislative Body.""  In his writings years later he documented his support for the ""total separation of the church from the state.""  ""Strongly guarded as is the separation between Religion & Govt in the Constitution of the United States,"" Madison wrote, and he declared, ""practical distinction between Religion and Civil Government is essential to the purity of both, and as guaranteed by the Constitution.""  John Locke also promoted this idea. In his, ""A Letter Concerning Toleration,"" Locke argued that, ""ecclesiastical authority must be separated from the authority of the state, or 'the magistrate.'""  Even George Washington supported this separation.  George Washington, who wrote to a group of clergy who protested in 1789 against a lack of mention of Jesus Christ in the Constitution, stated, ‚ÄúYou will permit me to observe that the path of true piety is so plain as to require but little political direction.‚Äù  That same year, he wrote to the Baptists of Virginia, ‚ÄúIf I could conceive that the general [federal] government might ever be so administered as to render the liberty of conscience insecure‚Ä¶ no one would be more zealous than myself to establish effectual barriers against the horrors of spiritual tyranny, and every species of religious persecution.""  As for a more recent example, even John F. Kennedy, in his Address to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association in 1960, stated, ""I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute.""  Furthermore, ""One Nation under God"" wasn't even added to the pledge of allegiance until the 1950s, when there was a moral panic and fundamentalist revival that unfairly persecuted anyone who was assumed to be gay, communist, atheist, or anything but a god fearing, Christian patriot for that matter.  The pledge of allegiance was first published in 1892 in an Issue of ""The Youth's Companion,"" an American Children's Magazine.  Francis Bellamy, a Christian **socialist**, who was said to have ""'championed the rights of working people and the equal distribution of economic resources,"" which he believed was inherent in the teachings of Jesus Christ, worked for the magazine and drafted the ""Pledge of Allegiance"" as part of a marketing campaign to solicit subscriptions and sell U.S. flags to public schools.  The issue coincided with the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus reaching the Americas; a marketing gimmick.  Bellamy ""believed in the absolute separation of church and state"" and intentionally did not include the phrase ""under God"" in his pledge.  What's more, Bellamy ""viewed his Pledge as an 'inoculation' that would protect immigrants and native-born but insufficiently patriotic Americans from the 'virus' of radicalism and subversion.""  Additionally, ""In God we trust"" wasn't officially adopted and mandated for our currency until the mid-20th century, as part of an effort to distinguish the U.S. from the big bad atheist communists of the Soviet Union.  And all of that aside, I shouldn't have to remind those on the religious right that our very first amendment prohibits the government from ""respecting an establishment of religion.""   The Supreme Court has also expanded upon and settled this debate, establishing three basic rules that must be followed in order to not violate the clause.  Government actions:  - must have a secular purpose - must not promote or inhibit religion - must not create excessive entanglement between the church and state   The fact of the matter is, religion is *not* the bedrock upon which our country, its constitution and its government was founded. And regardless of how many Christian Nationalists have slithered their way into our government, it is still wholly un-American to even suggest that Christianity be used as some state tool to pacify citizens, or become the basis for this country's rule of law.  It *is* self evident, that in the United States of America, religion has no place in government, and vice versa.",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-05-02T16:10:50,6

Christians really have no idea why people are abandoning their religion. Shit like this is only going to accelerate their decline and they are clueless how to stop it. They think that they can force their religion onto everyone and that the declining church membership is only because they aren't doing it hard enough.

So when Trump says he will ‚Äúbring religion back to our country‚Äù which denominations would be allowed?   Because not every American is Christian.

"I‚Äôm going to be put on a list for saying this, but I don‚Äôt care.   I‚Äôve been an atheist for my whole life. I was not raised with religion. As I got older, my early to mid teens, I was curious about religion. I was curious about how it worked. I tried to understand it. I went into this attempt at discovery with an open mind. It didn‚Äôt go so well.   I am an outsider, and it has always seemed absurd to me. The entire concept. I, for the life of me, can‚Äôt understand how so many people buy into this fanatical insanity.   It is my assessment that if you want to control a population, you need to keep them fearful. If you start indoctrination at an extremely young age, it becomes much easier to manipulate them as older children, and then into adulthood. Unfortunately, when people reach the age where they realize that there is no invisible man watching over all of us, no Sky Santa, or Volcano Krampus, they can‚Äôt bring themselves to question that belief system. It‚Äôs ingrained. They have been taught that even the act of *questioning* the beliefs is going to be a *really* bad idea.    I completely understand the people who believe that the ‚ÄúHoly Scriptures‚Äù are parables. That they are intended as a sort of‚Ä¶self-help book. That mixed with a lovely support group that meets on Sundays. Usually before the football games and car races are on tv. This, to me, seems healthy.    Unfortunately, MOST Christians, are not like this. They are mostly hateful, horrible people. People that are, at best hypocritical, and at worst, what they themselves would call ‚Äúheathens, sinners, naer-do-wells‚Ä¶etc.‚Äù  I am an atheist, but I try to lead a life where I‚Äôm good to all people, regardless of their station in life. I treat people with respect. Not because they are a certain color, or speak a certain language, or wear a symbol of the torture device of their favorite guy, but because we are all the same. I try to provide for my family the best that I can. I try to exhibit patience whenever I am able. I try to be introspective, and fix what I perceive as faults within myself. I don‚Äôt think I need a bunch of old, dead guys telling me how. Be it through song, or scripture.    This has led me to a hope, or wish that maybe there can be final judgement. A reckoning, if you will. I would really like to see the selfish, gluttonous, arrogant, racist, hypocritical people, who destroy peoples lives under the auspices of being godly, to have to hold up a mirror, and truly reflect on the entirety of their existence. To have to explain why they thought it necessary to demean, belittle, insult, or much worse, to a higher power. To a ‚ÄúJudge‚Äù. I would like to see their faces when they are made to understand true empathy.   I know it‚Äôs a fantasy. I know that horrible people will continue taking. That the bad people win. That good people are treated horribly. That there is no real justice. There are no happy endings. That life is most definitely ***NOT*** fair.   I was not alive for countless millennia. Then I was somehow ‚Äúactivated‚Äù. Now, I‚Äôve been conscious for nearly half a century, and I would like to be here for another half. After that, I will be ‚Äúdeactivated‚Äù, and I won‚Äôt be alive for countless millennia again.

"Firstly, fuck the church. Secondly, fuck off Donald. The Establishment Clause is not toilet paper to wipe your ass with. This is the Heritage Foundation through and through whispering in Trump's ear a la Wormtongue. It has their bloody fingerprints all over it. They can try, but it will fail, again and again. The world is becoming more secular every year, and that's a good thing. Regardless of your or anyone else's belief in faith, secularism is good for the species because given the current trajectory of climate change, we need people to not believe in an afterlife to help focus on being good stewards to our current lives and the planet they depend on. Secularism is winning, and no amount of forcing the issue is going to stop it or make it slow down, if anything this will only expedite the purging of faith from the majority of societies the world over.   Furthermore, laws are designed to be equitable and unbiased, at least that's the core aim in legal theory. Injecting faith into our core legal constructs will not only be corrosive to those aims and functions, but will allow for heavy discrimination in the application of laws that will touch every facet of a citizen's life. Think of it this way, if you are tried in a criminal court today, your faith is not really a consideration for judgement of your crimes (barring jury bias). In the system the Heritage Foundation is proposing, through Trump as a mouthpiece and executor, you could and would be discriminated against if you weren't ""Christian enough"". Additionally, those who were part of the ""Sky Daddy Club"" would get unjust leniency in criminal proceedings because of their faith and/or specific denomination. That is on the table. Employment discrimination laws would be so skewed too. You could be outright denied, with no recourse, being accepted to a job because you're ""not the 'right kind' of Christian"". You could be fired over your lack of belief, or beliefs that differ from your supervisor even if you're Christian (for instance if you're deeply Christian but are pro-life).   Lastly, and possibly more concerning, is the possibility and likelihood of supernatural justification for human rights abuses and violence at the hands of the State. We have seen time and time again throughout history the wild abuses of power and people through horrific violence and actions ""in the name of God"", even today. Look at any Theocratic society for reference. Erasing the barrier of Church from the State gives sanction to conduct State-sponsored actions ""in the name of God"" or going back to our criminal prosecution case, cover for criminal behavior because ""God spoke to them/told them to do this"". Some of the worst, most cruel and terrible people in history used the excuse of ""God telling"" them to do something or that it was okay, when deep down it was just a convenient excuse to do what they wanted with their dark heart's desires in the first place. We've seen this ""brand"" of Christian in the USA for a long while now, and we've seen their heart and lack of Christ-like behavior, let alone their lack of Biblical knowledge and lifestyles that grossly depart from true, Christian values. Trump and company will use Christianity as a weapon to conduct and condone horrific abuses of the American people if allowed to do so.",Cuntmasterflex9000,2025-05-02T15:22:55,1

They get fed a constant stream of fear and hate and with no regulation for that sort of thing people will get swept up by it. Lot of them are victims left behind as well. We can't just leave people to the mercy of an environment of fear and hatred without extending a hand and handling the root of the insecurity.   The thing with the Internet is you can find somebody saying anything you want. Any type of person holding any type of belief if you look you'll find it and then it's a cycle of ""people actually believe x? Are they absolute moron clowns? This is why the ____ is the worst""   The people who ""deserve"" being mocked online, the thing that actually hurts them the most is ignoring them. Instead focus on the good you're seeing, build people up, if you ain't got nothing nice to say just don't say anything and move on.   Our government is currently fumbling the ball. Understand that we're all humans that make mistakes and create room for those who were taken advantage of our unregulated media to find their way out. We're all born impressionable and we rely on the people who came before us to teach us how to human. Some people get bad or no teachers.   Want to see more empathy in the world? Provide empathy unconditionally and without expectation, where you can, safely. The deluge of rage only serves to keep us from thinking clearly.   Much like how we know it's not ""the trans"" and ""immigrants"" causing our problems, it's the wealthy people in power, trying to pin the blame on voters is like blaming plastic straws for climate change while corporations pollute our air land and sea for as much profit as possible in amounts magnitudes larger than even the collective of personal use.   Humans are simple creatures, what we see we do, radiate light for those that have none and show them by example that  there's another way.   üíú üíú",Niztoay,2025-05-02T19:32:30,1

"Religion never left our country.  It is still right where it always was.  Just different.  The people (some, not all) using religion changed and began using it as a weapon against everyone not like them.  Their priests told them it was okay and god's plan, which helped stabilize declining attendance starting a few decades back.  Look to the rise of mega churches with their highly questionable financial motives as well.    People were leaving their traditional churches for megachurches and fringe religions since they viewed their religion as not bespoke (white first and straight sexed) enough for them.  Actual factual data:  < 20 mega churches prior to 1960.   \>1800 in 2020  (professional marketing staff, multimedia worship, selling of seats, etc.)  75% of attendees are switchers from their religions to megachurches, which just happen to form the cornerstone of Christian ""political"" Fundamentalism in the US.  The overall number of adults attending some form of ""religious"" service in the past 65 years has dropped by as little as 1% to the highest estimate of 5% of the total population.  Meaning, with the population growth over the past 65 year, more people today, than in our entire history, are participating in some form of religious service on a weekly basis.  Don has told a lot of Whopper Lies but, ........... Bring Back Religion??  It never left and is bigger than ever.  So whatever he's blabbering on about is not what this is about.

"Separation of Church and State in my mind is a very Christian or at least Western Christian (Catholic/Protestant, Non-Orthodox) policy. I see a progress from the book of Romans where Paul basically tells Rome they don't have to worry about Christians because Christians believe the leaders of Rome were put there buy God. Much later after Rome becomes a Christian Empire Charlemagne and Pope Gregory setup a system where neither is subservient to the other. Separate but equal, if you will. After this the French Revolution codifies the separation of Church and State.  Before this, everywhere in the world, saw the leader of the nation as the leader of the religion. Now, even places like Japan who are not Christian and see their Emperor as a deity have this very Christian value on a separation of Church and State. It is one of the most defining factors of East vs West and making this separation is a 'Westernizing' factor.  I'll also say that this has been a very successful policy which has empowered Western civilization to dominate the world. Breaking down this separation is NOT Christian and will not help bring America success.",darthlincoln01,2025-05-03T10:31:10,1

"We are getting close to their ultimate goals, it‚Äôs what Peter Thiel/Palantir (an actual german Nazi who is a self professed Christian nationalist) is working with Cantor Fitzgerald and their ex-chairman and now commerce secretary Howard Lutnick to achieve. Cantor Fitzgerald supported the heritage foundation specifically Russ Vought (head of the office of budget management) when he wrote project 2025. All these actions that Trump is taking is part of a plan called scapegoat mechanism. Basically the idea is have a person in charge makes such horrible decisions that the people get so angry for change that you oblige and replace that leader. This making the masses think those problems are gone.  JD Vance is who they want to replace Trump. Vance‚Äôs benefactor, donor and mentor for over 10 years believes women should never have gotten that right is Peter Thiel. Peter Thiel personally escorted Vance into Mar-a-lago to smooth tensions between Vance and Trump. Gave Vance $15 million to become senator.  Palantir is what found Elon his adult and kids DOGE team and anyone that says Elon and Peter don‚Äôt like each other are fooling themselves, they worked together on PayPal and disagreed when one was promoted over the other. X is partnered with visa to make it a financial platform. Elon has said as part of the doge team using AI to rewrite all the social security code he wants to include in it the ability to make x the way folks can receive their benefits. Basically routed through x to get to their bank accounts. Rewriting the SSA code should take years to fully test it and make sure it‚Äôs secure for the long term instead he wants it done by September. He wants X to be an app to handle everything government related. The New York Times has an insane article out but it totally makes sense. DOGE teams have received clearance under an interagency agreement and arrived at the National Credit Union Administration and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the FCC.  Edit: gift article very nicely given by u/ Advanced_Level  https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/us/politics/trump-musk-data-access.html?unlocked_article_code=1.CU8.h6d7.ZwcbvFMgtpjZ&smid=url-share  Palantir which is led by real life German nazi (born in west Germany and raised in Swakopmund an insanely Nazi celebrating town in the 70‚Äôs where Peter Thiel‚Äôs father worked as an engineer on an uranium mine in violation of international law). Understand that the decision to fire the NSA chief and his deputy may be in fact be the most dangerous decision Trump has made so far along with the signing of the April 9th executive order removing all environmental protections and regulations through a sunset order which by all accounts even if scotus has to review it will not be stopped.  Anyone that‚Äôs says Peter Thiel doesn‚Äôt control Palantir is uninformed. Thiel directly owns roughly 180 million publicly traded shares which is 7%. His investment firm Rivendell 7 owns 34 million publicly traded shares. Other Thiel vehicles own 37 million shares. Thiel entities also own 32.5 million supervoting Class B shares in Palantir. Those class b shares carry 10 votes while public ones carry only 1 vote per share. Now here is the kicker for why he still controls Palantir (link below), Thiel has sole investment power over 335,000 class F shares as part of a trust that has 49.99% voting interest in the company.  https://www.barrons.com/articles/palantir-stock-chairman-peter-thiel-b63415c7  Timothy Haugh (recently fired NSA chief) like his last 2 predecessors were restricting the access and control Peter Thiel had through his company Palantir over the CIA/NSA to commit domestic surveillance. Palantir is the 2nd biggest defense contractor for the CIA/NSA along with providing day-to-day operations for both agencies along with UK intelligence agencies and their NHS, which is why NHS England was announced to be shutting down. The goal for Palantir is and always has been domestic surveillance and they already have it happening all across the UK with their police forces. Palantir is an intelligence corporation which provides advanced analysis, sigint, osint, criminal and threat awareness and kill chain efficiencies to all levels of US, UK, and corporate agencies.  https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-doge-recruiting-palantir/  https://www.salon.com/2024/07/22/jd-vance-owes-almost-everything-to-peter-thiel-a-pro-billionaire-and-new-right-ideologue/  https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/08/jd-vance-women-weird-voting-peter-thiel.html",nycdiveshack,2025-05-02T14:37:03,128

Jesus didn't ha e access to the best schools, and yet by the age of 13 could hold conversations with Rabbis and religious teacher, Trump had to pass schooling based on his family money. Jesus worked as a carpenter by trade, Trump was a slumlord and failed businessman, Jesus taught love, mercy, hope, responsibility, care for the poor, sick, orphan, widow, imprisoned. He dined with prostitutes and tax collectors and they repented. He rebuked the religious leaders of his day. He gave His life for all the world. Trump teaches selfishness. Greed, envy harm to anyone who gets in his way or opposes him, and has spent over twice the time that Jesus did on earth making every day only about getting more for Donald Trump.¬†   I hope one day Trump is capable of real repentance and humility.

"Hang in here with me for a second. Or not actually. Men invented Abrahamic religions which was the origin of the modern patriarchy we are experiencing right now. Men wrote these religons, made them up, creative writing, in response to the PAGAN beliefs of the day that had GODDESSES and worshipping ussy was yucky so they wanted to reorientate society's norms to worshipping a VIRGIN birth that was really, responsible by the men. God put the baby there. Christianity was their way to try to take credit for what nature did. Nature gave the responsibility of pregnancy to women. Who gets pregnant? Not trying to overly complicate it, but it's not meatballs and pasta that bake the bread. Worshipping goddesses meant respecting women(comparatively to what was/is, anyway).  No way. It had to go. And today, the men are now trying to bring their ""prophecies"" THEY MADE UP to ""life"" as some kind of ultimate mental gymnastics stupid olympics we're just all supposed to go along with because a few ahles have a lot of money and feel threatened by the idea women are rejecting them and they need to regain that control.

"Sure, but you need the replacement to also be a populist leader who inspired fear and devotion. In fact it's hard to pull that kind of replacement in the first place because people are loyal to dear leader above all else; fucking him over is likely to make those people feel betrayed and angry. *Especially* in a country as big as the US, you need those people, because the military and police are not sufficient to enforce order. I had long suspected that fascism falls when its base turns on the movement, because they're organized, pissed off, armed, and willing to use violence; that guy who wrote *How to Talk to your Son about Fascism* confirmed as much in his AMA.

"Well plenty of humans have been easily manipulated just using social media.  The thing is, all this stuff is quite fantastical and delusional. I can believe that billionaires like Musk and Thiel would start to think they are super special and have some destiny or purpose or insane ability to control the world or whatever. I can believe that, once you amass that much wealth and have some success with psychological warfare using social media to sway millions of humans to vote for this or that or to be violent or to ignore certain things, you might start believing you have absolute power and can do whatever you want. Delusions of grandeur will seem less delusional if you have already accomplished so much, and of course it is human nature to assume that the things you‚Äôve achieved are solely due to your own special qualities or effort and to ignore all the flukes of chance and happenstance that helped you get there.  But I find it very hard to believe that these people will actually succeed with whatever it is they‚Äôre planning. I don‚Äôt think they are as smart as they think they are, and they seem to have some psychological problems that prevent them from understanding how complex reality and humanity really is. The fact they ignore climate change, for one, indicates that they are not really as clued into reality as they think. The fact they rely on AI and think AI could really handle the complexity of reality, especially involving human behaviour, also indicates they‚Äôre a bit silly.   So far I think these people are like the equivalent of someone like that guy Alex Murdoch who killed his wife and kid after a lifetime of getting away with all kinds of fraud etc due to the status he was born into. He had got away with it all for so long by scheming he really thought that he could kill his family and that it would just be another way to help him cover up or get away with his other crimes and that it would work and everyone would believe him. There are people like this all over, born into privilege, take advantage of their status to do awful things and get away with it, which convinces them more and more of their own power so they do more and more, but eventually their hubris takes them too far and reality smacks them in the face.  Some get further than others, but at the end of the day reality is reality and when you lose sight of it, it has its ways of making itself known.",KittyGrewAMoustache,2025-05-03T05:24:26,1

"Left Behind books do not follow scripture, at all.   This is straight from scripture, starting with the False Prophet:   The False Prophet- also called 'Beast #2' in Revelation 13 'brings fire from the sky in the sight of men' - before all men, a worldwide audience who will watch this in awe.  He brings a 'new currency' which he will replace the old currencies with.  He has the ability to 'Mark' head or hand with something that will interact with this new currency. Only those who accept the Mark will be able to buy or sell. Every living person on earth will have to accept or reject this Mark.  Beast #2 joins the Antichrist after the Antichrist 'seemingly suffers a mortal head wound'. He will promote the Antichrist, and in exchange Beast #2 is granted 'all authority' of the Antichrist, by the Antichrist over the Nation and it's wealth.  This Nation is the richest and most powerful on Earth- 'able to trod down all other nations'.  Beast#2 and the Antichrist will plunder the Nations riches and ""divide the land for a price"" (of loyalty) to a small number of followers. In other words, they will sell the nations public lands and plunder it's wealth.  The Antichrist will take over this country by 'guile' ""without ever having been given the honor of royalty"" In other words, without ever holding public office before in his life. He will convince the people he is 'above the law' and become, literally, ""the Lawless One"".  Jesus said ""I came in my Fathers name and was rejected..."", but the Antichrist will ""come in his own name"" and be embraced by Christians and Jews. In other words- The AC's own name is his 'brand'.  Many Christians will flock to him as a quasi 'savior' and he will fool even the leadership of the churches. They will set him on high.  He will invade the King of the South - North- and eventually attack a nation 'to the east'. He will come to power claiming peace and safety- then go to war against his neighbors.  He will make a peace Accord for Israel and her neighbors and the expand this to a 7 year agreement, adding more. Eventually he will stab Israel in the back.  The world will look upon him (and follow his every move) in 'wonder'. The word translation in Strong's Concordance from the Greek is more like 'flabbergasted' or shocked or amazed. NOT 'loved'. Christians and some others who are under a ""great delusion"" will follow and worship him- but not the entire world. 2 Thessalonians 2, Matt. 24:24.  He is a 'Vile' person. Daniel 11:21  He is boastful: He continually boasts about himself- speaking ""great things and then even greater.""  He will roar like a lion, letting everyone know who is the best and most powerful of men. Daniel 7:4  He is a liar who will prosper because of his lies:  ""By his cunning he shall make deceit prosper under his hand, and in his own mind he shall become great."" - Daniel 8:25a  ""...and it will throw truth to the ground, and it will act and prosper."" - Daniel 8:12  He is a contemptible person:  ""In his place shall arise a contemptible person to whom royal majesty has not been given. He shall come in without warning and obtain the kingdom by flatteries."" - Daniel 11:21  He is described as 'stout', heavy-set: ""...and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows."" Dan 7:21  This Antichrist will rise to power ""from the Sea"". Mar means 'Sea', in Spanish. And in the end he will go into the ""Lake of Fire"".

Guerilla warfare requires the allegiance or at least sympathy of the local population. Thus successful examples tend to occur when nations are invaded. People unite against an outside enemy and even if they don't actively resist they are unlikely to inform on resisters. In a civil war a lot of your neighbors will be Republican drastically limiting your ability to hide in plain sight.   The sad reality is that most of the ardent-2nd Amendment people are supporting fascism. Widespread access to firearms in the USA isn't a deterrent to tyranny because gun owners are more likely to join paramilitary death squads than oppose the dictatorship.,yo2sense,2025-05-02T21:37:32,3

"I can help elaborate on this; it's wish fulfillment for a number of reasons. First and foremost, it's a testament to Christ's salvation. For the Antichrist to exist, for humanity to go through Tribulation, it means that 1) Christ is indeed the son of God who died for the sins of all man and 2) they will be saved.  There's some ambiguity in the Bible as to whether Tribulation occurs before or after Rapture. Someone with more theological knowledge can elaborate on that, but there are different schools of thought. As the name implies, *Left Behind* suggests all the believers have been whisked away to their holy paradise leaving the sinners/heathens behind to suffer the Tribulation. There is also contention over whether one can be truly saved during Tribulation in this worldview due to the nature of faith; in the Left Behind series, they can.  If we were to assume that Trump is the Antichrist then there's no wish fulfillment to be had, unless we haven't actually reached Tribulation yet. The Christians get to suffer along with the rest of us.  There is, in fact, a group (several really, but one notable) that wishes to usher in ~~the Apocalypse~~ Armageddon, the Seven Mountain Mandate. They believe that by controlling the seven ""Mountains"" referenced in Revelation in relation to the Beast (family, religion, education, media, entertainment, business, government) they can usher in the end times. Incidentally and of no further consequence or agenda at all, several members of this administration have ties to the SMM, Trump's spiritual advisor among them.

"> I've also read that the 'rise to power from the Sea' is more a reference to his linage meaning born a Gentile  The Bible often has dual (or more) meanings to important passages. Some of which is obvious, and then is glaringly obvious as prophecy unfolds. For instance the FP, Beast#2, is said to gain power from the 'Dragon'. I believe that is a dual meaning. 'The Dragon' being the Biblical term commonly used for Satan, but [now also this](https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/25/will-elon-musk-give-us-the-cyborg-dragon-we-want-or-the-one-we-need/).
