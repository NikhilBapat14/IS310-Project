"She thinks she got what she wanted from a scumbag whose notorious for screwing people over and never keeping his promises. He's saying one thing now, but he likely will be saying something different tomorrow. It pisses me off democrats still don't know how to deal with him. Why are they so weak and spineless?",Endofignorance4444,2025-04-29T20:41:12,8

"Newsom...Fetterman....Whitmer....who's next?  I appreciate the Rankins, Goldmans, Murphys, Pritzer's, the 13 governors and AGs suing Trump and all the other officials who are smart enough to see through Trump and brave enough to stand up to him.",FIlm2024,2025-04-30T00:03:09,2

"Whitmer now has to suck up to this dictator in order to save her constituents and the Michigan economy that would suffer some of the greatest setbacks because of tariffs.   I bet speaking at his rally and humiliating herself was part of the deal, too.   For now, I still respect her. But I truly hope she doesn’t become a sycophant dino in her attempts to save Michigan‘s economy and constituents.",HumongousBelly,2025-04-29T17:56:18,5

I hope this is enough to retire the (generic) aspirations for a presidential run from her.,Bloo95,2025-04-30T00:32:00,1

"Its not bad optics. Its her being the spineless neoliberal that she is at best, or a closeted collaborator at worst. Even showing up to the event in the nose bleeds is unexcusable.  Looks like the left was right about her, Newsom, and pretty much any other liberal/centrist darling.",Oldschoolhype2,2025-04-30T00:48:29,5
It’s almost a feature of Democrats at this point. They wonder why they have to nearly beg every election for people to vote.,Romano16,2025-04-29T20:57:03,6
">I still respect her  I dot not.  Why would you cater to Trump when his popularity is at an all time low? His own base, minus the most extreme MAGA members, dislike him now. Let him sink.  Even if she made a deal with him for the ""greater good"", what makes her think he will respect it? We've seen countless of times now that his promises don't mean shit. He can say something one day and say the opposite the very next day because he's in a bad mood or whatever. He cannot be trusted.  You arent getting anything by trying to appease the fascists. The most charitable interpretation I can give her for doing this is that she's thinking in very short terms...",Knowledge_Moist,2025-04-29T21:38:34,7
