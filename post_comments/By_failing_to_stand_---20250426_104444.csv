"Complete opinion piece by Ben Satterlee, Eagle:  >**Congressional cowardice**   >The Congress of the United States, once the platform of patriots, is now in very real danger of becoming mere window dressing for the Trump regime. The only legal solution to the current constitutional crisis we have been so wantonly plunged into by the president is to impeach him.   >Under any other circumstances, “mistakenly” deporting Kilmar Abrego Garcia (a U.S. legal resident) to a prison in another country without trial would be grounds for impeachment, so why not now?   >Under any other circumstances, the president not faithfully executing the laws of the United States (such as flouting an order by the Supreme Court to return Mr. Garcia) would be grounds for impeachment, so why not now?   >Under any other circumstances, the president even hinting at deporting U.S. citizens for their political opinions would be grounds for impeachment, so why not now?   >Because this Republican Congress is full of cowards.   >**If Congress does not act now to impeach Trump and bring Mr. Garcia home, then they will not only be cowards, but oath-breakers and traitors.** ",Silent-Resort-3076,2025-04-26T10:45:27,252

All this chaos, all this confusion, all this loss, all this uncertainty, and all this authoritarianism— falls square on the shoulders of *Mike Johnson*  The GOP went mask off. They don’t want to do their jobs. They don’t want you to have a job. They don’t want you to have freedoms or rights— they just want power. And are willing to burn the nation down to get it.

"Congress has always been full of cowards; both parties approving wars with drool coming out of their mouthes like a dog watching food fall from the table. Vietnam, Korea, gulf war, Afghanistan, Iraq, etc all of these were approved bilaterally in congress with no resistance. Congress is nothing but business-people who just want money and security that they refuse to give to us. They will kill millions in every country they invade as long as it means that some profit has been made and the economy grows. This is the ugly truth people, until the common person like the teachers in your public schools, the electrician, the coal miner, the dock worker, and people who hold the sky so people like Jeff bezos can go to space have a legitimate and equal chance at being president and member of congress, we are essentially electing nobility. We’re in a feudal system, a system that the European colonizers of this country could never let go of, it always served their people well in the past, and it works even now. People have smart phones but they will still work the land and lay taxes to their lord which gives nothing to them but minimum wage and thoughts and prayers when the workers are sick (maybe even 50 dollars for your gofundme).                     This is why they have made American over 55% functionally illiterate, this is why they have destroyed our educational system, this is why the textbooks and books they ban and allow is done the way it is -an educated person in America is a direct danger to American hegemony and fascism. They have made college nearly impossible or a debt trap while also controlling what the universities teach (like Columbia and Yale hosting Ben givr). Congress isn’t full of cowards, it’s full of co-conspirators who censure people like Rashida Talib.

Realize that extreme factions are giving the Republicans talking points - The harder we fought for just 1-2 percent of the party - became 90 percent of the Republican issues.  They literally won with no platform using our own extremists as a rallying cry.     4. When over half of the country sees you as a bigger threat than communism because you want to completely isolate them you literally turn them into people who hate you.  You will not sway hate with logic.  Kamala Harris was one hundred percent right about the economy - yet not once has she spoken about it since the election.     5. Realize one last fact.  Trump had his 2025 plan.  Not one person addressed it point by point to the public.  Many said, ""This is bad,"" or ""This is un-American,"" but where is the pubic scorecard post election showing exactly how many points of the 2025 plan have been achieved?   6.

Our system tasks lawmakers with creating solutions to pressing societal problems, often with no simple answers and huge likelihoods for unintended consequences. Crafting legislative proposals is a learned skill; as in other professions, experience matters. In fact, as expert analysis has shown with the recently passed Senate tax bill, policy crafted by even the most experienced of lawmakers is likely to have ambiguous provisions and loopholes that undermine the intended effects of the legislation. The public is not best served if inexperienced members are making policy choices with widespread, lasting effects. > Being on the job allows members an opportunity to learn and navigate the labyrinth of rules, precedents and procedures unique to each chamber. Term limits would result in large swaths of lawmakers forfeiting their hard-earned experience while simultaneously requiring that freshman members make up for the training and legislative acumen that was just forced out of the door. > Members who know their time in Congress is limited will face less pressure to develop expertise on specific issues simply because, in most cases, the knowledge accrued won’t be nearly as valuable in a few short years. > We have seen a semblance of this effect after Republicans limited House committee chairs to six years at the helm. The incentives for chairs to dive deep into the policy details of their committee’s jurisdiction are now limited, given that chairs know they will soon be forced to give up the gavel. (In the 115th Congress alone, an alarming seven House Chairs have announced their retirements from Congress.) > Thus, term limits would impose a tremendous brain drain on the institution. Fewer experienced policymakers in Congress results in increased influence of special interests that are ready and willing to fill the issue-specific information voids. Additionally, a decrease in the number of seasoned lawmakers would result in greater deference to the executive branch and its agencies that administer the laws on a daily basis, given their greater expertise and longer tenure.  As they explain well, The brain drain is a real issue. Experience matters in pretty much any complex profession.  > Democracy needs rules to function. Everything needs rules and order to function.

In Athens any man above a certain age could vote, but not women or slaves cus of something I forgot (probably misogyny), but it was a reason, even if it made no sense. So why don’t we learn from them and start qualifying voter eligibility, again, with a knowledge proficiency test? This time not for racism but for pragmatism.

Yeah I guess all of our ideas are relatively infeasible. My pragmatic hope is that conservatives churn out the maga people and the liberals do the same with the progressives and those morons can make a new extremely unlikable party where they just argue amongst one another while the rest of us get along with our lives but they serve as an element that would disrupt the two party system we suffer with   I see conservatives making more headway than liberals btw. Saw a great thread in r/conseebwtive about how maga were flip flopping on support for Ukraine because of sheeple culture and so many conservatives were really comprehensively connected to the issue in a way I haven’t seen most people talk about it over the last few years. It was surprisingly inspiring.   There are people on both sides who really are intelligently aware of what’s going on and then there are a bunch of bell curve morons on both sides bickering and driving the dichotomous narratives to antagonize one another because they are mindless mobs who react to emotional arousal and haven’t any available bandwidth left for it being hijacked by the media.

Idc how much western propaganda you pull out but even the CIA admitted that Stalin was not the “dictator” that the west made him out to be to discredit communism and revolution. A lot of the people Stalin killed were traitors, trying to take advantage of citizens, etc. Post WWII the standard of living was excellent.   As for Haiti, the 1791 Revolution. If you think they were better before, you’re disgusting.   Vietnam… hmm why were they at war?? Lmfao so tone deaf.  As for revolutions, idk where you think governments come from. Like… seriously. Pretty much every stable country today was born out of violence. It is the norm. Not the exception. You have it flipped.  Struggle against exploitation is always inherently a good thing. Like I’ve said multiple times now and you have not addressed. Voting does not work. It has not. It will not. The American system cannot be reformed. It can only be replaced.

"See, the issue with that is it ignores two major factors:  1. The ""human element,"" like I mentioned earlier. 2. Who decides what the ""correct level"" of critical thinking even is?  Historically, humans have gone far out of their way to screw over swaths of people they don't like. This isn’t unique to America — every country, at one point or another, has suppressed groups of people. And everyone generally agrees that's bad.   But here’s the kicker: those decisions to suppress people, as you said, ""made sense at the time."" Humans can be incredibly dumb and short-sighted. And beyond just stupidity, there's also the **malicious** factor. Some people genuinely suck — they *salivate* at the idea of taking control away from others.  A clear example of humans not working well inside a system? Communism. On paper, it looks great. In practice? It decays into corruption, oligarchy, and eventually collapses under its own weight.   That's not to say capitalism is immune to corruption — saying that would be insane. No system is clean. But giving any government blanket control to do and say whatever it wants never leads anywhere good.  And that flows into the next big problem: **who decides these values?**   Maybe you form a ""council"" that votes on what's acceptable or not, but it only takes **one bad actor** to twist the system to benefit themselves — stripping away the voices of entire groups of people. That kind of setup generates massive risks and issues, to the point that I honestly hope we never see anything like it. It starts to bleed into **thought police** territory.  It’s a terrifying prospect. While I can appreciate the *spirit* behind the idea, any real-world implementation of it would be terrifying — to say the least.",Hadrian23,2025-04-26T16:01:00,1
