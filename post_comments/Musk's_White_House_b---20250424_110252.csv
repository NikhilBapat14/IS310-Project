"As [Elon Musk](https://inews.co.uk/topic/elon-musk?ico=in-line_link) prepares to[ “step back”](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/elon-musk-to-reduce-role-in-trump-administration-3654566?ico=in-line_link) from [Donald Trump](https://inews.co.uk/topic/donald-trump?ico=in-line_link)’s side and return to his day job at [Tesla](https://inews.co.uk/topic/tesla?srsltid=AfmBOorFulsoRIgrvW_9ScA6jbhrtl7Y-ivlHWGBgN0A31xfVVCOer2E&ico=in-line_link), it may not simply have been the [plunging profits at his electric car giant](https://inews.co.uk/opinion/teslas-glory-days-are-over-and-its-elon-musks-fault-3656039?ico=in-line_link) that forced him out of the President’s inner circle.  For months, rumours have circulated in Washington about the disdain that many of the President’s top lieutenants share for Musk, the unelected head of Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (which is not really a US government department). Now, it seems clear that [Musk hastened his own demise](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/trumps-musk-gamble-backfired-americans-sick-doge-3655155?ico=in-line_link) by sparking a stand-up row with the Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, in the West Wing itself.  The website Axios is [reporting that](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/23/musk-bessent-trump-white-house-irs) Bessent and the richest man in the world engaged in a White House verbal brawl that was described by one observer as “two billionaire, middle-aged men thinking it was WWE \[Worldwide Wrestling Entertainment\] in the hall of the West Wing”. The clash reportedly began in the Oval Office itself, as tensions over Musk’s effort to promote his own candidate to head the Internal Revenue Service (America’s equivalent of HMRC) boiled over.  Bessent was furious that Gary Shapley, a Musk acolyte, had been appointed as acting commissioner of the IRS, an agency that reports directly to the Treasury Department. *The New York Times* [earlier reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/us/politics/irs-scott-bessent-elon-musk.html) that Bessent successfully sought Trump’s intervention to oust Shapely from his new role, and install the Treasury Secretary’s own pick for the job.  “Scott can’t stand Musk,” one Bessent supporter told Axios, arguing that the antipathy between the two men “goes pretty deep and pretty far back”. Certainly as far back as January, when Musk was trying to persuade Trump that Bessent was not the right man to helm the Treasury Department.",theipaper,2025-04-24T11:05:14,2

"All administrations, of course, are pockmarked by personality clashes among top officials. But Musk’s ability to rankle his fellow Trump appointees is unprecedented in the modern era.  In fewer than 100 days of the President’s second term, Musk has alienated Secretary of State Marco Rubio by single-handedly[ shutting down the US Agency for International Development](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/trump-musk-unprecedented-power-washington-cant-stop-3518005?srsltid=AfmBOorUVYzQfK6CdxQahoHyd9x9oUGKLGodWXbguK0C0U8v6pe5FzPT&ico=in-line_link); he has infuriated [Peter Navarro](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/peter-navarro-behind-trump-tariffs-3620170?srsltid=AfmBOoq0KyBS5PWxkULgNk0-PxucDRAePg1zRxsTSMD3tR2M9Dd4sBjU&ico=in-line_link), the President’s trade adviser, publicly described by Musk as “dumber than a sack of bricks”; and he has burnt his relationship with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy by trying to circumvent the department in a failed effort to fire air traffic control employees.  Things became so heated within Trump’s inner circle that in late February, the President [interrupted a cabinet meeting](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/26/politics/video/trump-cabinet-meeting-elon-musk-doge-digvid) to invite his top appointees to speak publicly about any reservations they had about Musk. Amid nervous laughter and much shuffling of paper in the Cabinet Room, not a soul took the President up on his televised offer, as Musk watched on with glee.  Commenting on the Musk-Navarro spat last week, the White House Press Secretary [Karoline Leavitt ](https://inews.co.uk/news/trump-karoline-leavitt-youngest-ever-white-house-secretary-3384285?ico=in-line_link)insisted “boys will be boys”. Following the latest revelations concerning Musk’s row with Bessent, she described disagreements as being “part of any healthy policy process”.  But more than most cabinet members, Bessent is struggling on multiple fronts to persuade Trump to engage in a time-honoured “healthy policy process”. This month, he successfully persuaded Trump to engage in a[ partial U-turn over the so-called reciprocal tariffs](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/trump-tariff-uturn-questions-answered-3633926?srsltid=AfmBOop9QLhsNHDTE0QrbsX60HJrGuS0Bdoo4IIYzuT243ZItkqzlwtD&ico=in-line_link) that the President announced on 9 April, flying to Mar-a-Lago to engage in a weekend intervention and warning his boss that he had lost the confidence of Wall Street.",theipaper,2025-04-24T11:05:30,4

"On Tuesday, he publicly described the President’s [trade war against China](https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/uk-rejects-pressure-from-trump-to-freeze-out-china-3645364?ico=in-line_link) as “not sustainable”, and in his latest effort to soothe America’s roiling financial markets insisted that “de-escalation” and the negotiation of a “big deal” between the two countries was in the offing.  On the fringes of this week’s International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings, the Treasury Secretary has held bilateral meetings with the finance ministers of multiple countries [including Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves](https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/three-trump-tariffs-reeves-target-us-visit-uk-economy-3653061?ico=in-line_link). All of them are seeking clarity about the future of Trump’s trade war, stability in global markets and [trade deals](https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/hopes-rise-us-trade-deal-within-month-reeves-washington-3651146?ico=in-line_link) to help offset the worst effects of the President’s trade barriers.  While Bessent appears to have neutralised – at least for now – Musk’s capacity to serve as an irritant, it is unclear whether he can carry the day more broadly in the Oval Office. His desire to put the trade war in Trump’s rear-view mirror puts him at odds with Navarro, seen as the White House Rasputin guiding Trump’s long-term protectionist impulses.  Trump’s capacity to listen to the most recent voice in his ear appears boundless, and in a government with no restraining influences, Bessent faces a continuing struggle to tame his boss’s impulses.
