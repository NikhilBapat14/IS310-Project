"Why is our government allowing this fascist and his regime to destroy America? The government is complicit. No one can change my mind that Trump cheated to win the election. He’s admitted it twice on tv. I’ve never felt so helpless in my life, watching my country get destroyed.",Prestigious-Log-7210,2025-05-06T14:48:26,7
Hegseth is a traitor and a spy.  He should be fired and prosecuted.,The-M0untain,2025-05-06T17:55:28,10

"They're both dumbasses, but I'm betting Trump was at fault for this.  Well even if Pete was at fault, Donald hired him.  They're all just do dysfunctional and amateur, it would be funny if it wasn't so serious.",yourmomwasmyfirst,2025-05-06T18:04:41,3
"Hegseth acted alone and kept Trump in the dark? Yeah, right.    But if Trump wants to throw someone under the bus for halted aid, that is actually great news for Ukraine",Intro-Nimbus,2025-05-06T18:53:10,3
Cuz he’s a commie,Myke_X7,2025-05-06T12:44:00,4
Foreign Leaders should just troll Trump by asking to only speak to the decision makers.,JonBoy82,2025-05-06T14:22:16,2

Sounds like he got paid to do it.,blackcain,2025-05-06T16:02:13,1
We need a meme of Trump on his hands and knees with a ball gag and Hegseth standing over him with a whip holding a bottle of vodka.  If it went viral Hegseth would be fired in less than 24 hours.,Independent_Tie_4984,2025-05-07T03:10:26,1

"Hegseth may be getting his directions from someone other than the president, perhaps one of the Christian nationalist groups that staffed his administration or directed the creation of Project 2025.",Arrmadillo,2025-05-06T14:56:20,30
Push this. Trump won’t like it and he’ll get rid of him. This is how we fight our battles.,Vig_2,2025-05-06T20:21:39,5

For all the talk of running the country as a business… we sure do operate like a small scale family business instead of the supposed national corporate enterprise people were envisioning.   Granted “run country like a business” is dog whistle for “we will hurt brown people more”,zffjk,2025-05-06T15:08:36,9

"They're all self-centered, self-aggrandizing, self-absorbed morons who think that they ""know better"" than everyone else.   It's a fucking party full of Dunning-Krueger syndrome motherfuckers. They're all too stupid to know that they're stupid, and too malicious to give a damn. So it's just backstabbing and childish bullshit all the way down while they gleefully ruin people's lives and make the world dramatically worse for their own profit... until eventually a bigger fish fucks them over and then they act all shocked because they never once stopped to consider that *perhaps* they might not be the smartest piece of shit in the room.",Gonkar,2025-05-06T14:29:30,18
