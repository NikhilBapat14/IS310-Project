The stock market crash in 1929 led directly to fascists dominating European politics in the 1930‚Äôs. Does Trump hope by deliberately tanking the world economy he will precipitate a similar turn towards fascism in the 2020‚Äôs?,PengJiLiuAn,2025-04-04T13:40:48,2
"He's just continuing where he left off.  If it's all going to burn anyway, we might have been better off if his terms were consecutive. At least more of his base would have died from covid.",idigholesnow,2025-04-04T06:35:40,1
"* **1828 Tariff:** Northern gain, Southern pain. Led to Nullification Crisis, one of the arguments for states rights Civil War. * **Smoot-Hawley:** High tariffs, trade war.

God I never understood this obsession with hating her for her laugh. I thought it was delightful and contagious. A beautiful belly laugh of joy that showed she didn‚Äôt take herself too seriously. What the fuck is wrong with that people??!! üò°,lucolapic,2025-04-04T18:44:29,1
Mocking Trump voters will just make them more loyal to him.  Go after Trump and Republican politicians. They're the real villains here.   The vast majority of voters don't really know who to trust and mainly just respond to the media bubble they exist in. Now is the time to help them see how awful Trump and Republican politicians really are.,softnmushy,2025-04-03T18:36:05,2

Honestly if they can‚Äôt see it for themselves there‚Äôs no hope. They are in a cult. ‚ÄúReasoning‚Äù with them has not worked. They have to wake up on their own. We just have to hope it happens before it all burns down.,lucolapic,2025-04-04T18:46:28,1
