"Bless you, Bernie.  Nearly all of Congress forgot we're breaking our own laws and complicit in a genocide.  Psychos Trump and yahu would rather think about snatching ""waterfront property"" than freeing Israeli hostages, or unblocking aid to starving people.  Starving Israelis alongside Gazan civilians?  That's an easy equation for these egomaniacs...  I'm sure the new AMERICAN Pope will have advice for the AMERICAN overlord of this obscene disaster.  >Sanders has moved to block some U.S. weapons sales under both the Biden and second Trump administrations, but his efforts have not garnered enough support in Congress to succeed. Still, people across the United States and around the world have condemned the Israeli assault on Gaza as genocide—and Israel faces a case on the subject at the International Court of Justice.",XSinTrick6666,2025-05-09T03:02:07,167

"Mass starvation of captive populations has always been a weapon of war. The Nazis were famous for doing it, as were the Soviets. Also, sending in too few calories to supply everybody forces a captive population to turn and fight each other over food, which is what Israel's latest announced plan is. They're only going to send in 60% of the food necessary to keep the entire captive population from starving, which means the Palestinians will be forced to fight each other for food for their babies and their children. It's ironic that Israel is relying on Nazi tactics in their war on the Gaza civilian population. They learned well from their oppressors.",noncongruent,2025-05-09T09:24:43,37

"I mean, yes, certainly. But I feel like folks are perhaps not understanding the degree to which the US' imperial interests benefit from Israel, which is why the US lets Israel get away with things like this.  There are folks out there who like to insist that Israel is somehow ""pulling the strings"" of US politicians. And of course Israelis do genuinely try to lobby the US government and do put in a lot of work to influence US-based think tanks and policy experts that in turn inform US foreign policy. But Israel does not control America. Rather, America supports Israel because Israel serves the US' foreign policy goals.  And that's the thing that Americans in particular need to start realizing and acting upon. If the US had different foreign policy that did not benefit so deeply from cooperation with this morally bankrupt apartheid state, Israel would not have had nearly this level of cover to commit this genocide and perpetuate this apartheid. When people say that the US is complicit in the genocide, they're not just talking about the arms shipments or even the diplomatic cover.  The US has a deep desire to assert hegemonic power over West Asia and North Africa, including especially the Suez Canal and the Mediterranean Sea. Israel helps the US do that, and it plays such a big role in maintaining the US' foreign interests that the US will do nearly anything Israel wants in exchange. Israel is operating under a US umbrella, and historians will remember the Gaza genocide as a crime of American Empire, even though it is only indirectly facilitated by the American State.",Gilamath,2025-05-09T10:57:32,9

"Short-term, yes. We've given them so many military, economic, geographic, and intel advantages over the years that it's pretty insurmountable. Unless a global superpower takes direct steps to stop Israel, we're 100% looking at something between the Trail of Tears and Japanese occupation of Korea for Palestinians.  Mid-term, it's just going to stop working after a point. Israel is strong for its size, but it has depended heavily on Western favoritism to punch out of its weight class. Without that favoritism, they won't stay that ahead forever given the raw size discrepancies--at least not if they behave so badly to truly unite the region against them with the collective understanding the US won't be playing bodyguard.  But that decay in relative power would also be incredibly dangerous. Because Israel is at this point a rogue nuclear state (and arguably a nuclear terrorist state) led by ideological hardliners willing to do anything. They won't just casually accept a doomed long-term and would likely escalate with devastating regional & global consequences.",Sminahin,2025-05-09T07:36:47,12

Hamas accepted a ceasefire numerous times (going back to May 2024) only for Israel to move the goal posts at the last minute - he then blamed Hamas (even though international and Israeli media made it clear it was Israel to blame). * His own Secretary of State lied to Congress about Israel blocking humanitarian aid into Gaza - he withheld a joint DOS/USAID report that found that Israel was purposely blocking aid.",walkallover1991,2025-05-10T00:03:35,2

"I mean, I went to school for Arabic and Political science with a focus on terrorism and I did live near the Palestinian border while trying to get really good at cultural studies & language work. Take a guess what government departments I was looking for a job in pre-Trump.  I think the current Israeli government is on a cycle of continuous escalation because Netanyahu has openly been a forever-war candidate since the 90s who relies on continuous conflict to cover up his own personal misdeeds. This is not done out of Israel's best interests--Netanyahu has taken his actions in direct opposition to the advice coming out of his intelligence and military experts. Times of Israel has been reporting on this since the 2010s. Everyone thought it was a terrible idea for Netanyahu to become Hamas's primary sponsor. Everyone pointed to the obvious risks when Netanyahu worked really hard to make sure Hamas ruled Gaza. None of this was done to make Israel safer.  Israel has no interest in curbing its militant, aggressive expansionism. This is putting the Arab world in a position where they have literally zero choice but to oppose Israel. Jordan and Egypt could well be destabilized either way--they're damned if they support Israel and screwed if they don't. A very likely result is an escalating regional conflict edging towards WW3. At some point, a greater power will have to step in and it will very likely not be on Israel's side--we Americans are neutering our geopolitical strength and positioning China as the main shotcaller on the world stage. China does not have the same views on Israel that we do.  So you're going to have escalating regional tensions with an increasingly detached US and new world powers that are far less favorably disposed towards Israel. I'm very worried how this will play out and I wouldn't be surprised if things got very messy for Israel as a direct result of Netanyahu's actions. How do you think this will play out maybe 20-30 years down the line?  >Why? To protect Hamas? To protect Hezbollah? To protect the Houthis?  I just want to make something really clear. You do realize that our support of Netanyahu's policy right now actually means we're acting **in Hamas's best interests**, correct?

">You're also conveniently ignoring that most the Western world outside the US has condemned Israeli actions in Gaza.  Sorta.

And with everything surrounding Netanyahu's first election. The rest of the Western world (aside from Ireland iirc) was cowardly and slow in recognizing that.

"It's awful, I agree. I'd prefer Israel's leaders end up in the Hague for genocide.    I do think you're giving Iran a free pass for the terrorists they create themselves, regardless of what the West does.  They don't want any other country in the ME to be stable.  Not unlike the Chinese in their regional ambitions.   But like I say, the military people see an advantage to opposing Iranian hegemony.   It's not without reason.",insuproble,2025-05-09T11:19:01,1
"""Yeah, I wasn't aware of some parliamentary structure that was immediately scrapped by an attempted coup in 2007.""  This is dishonest, it existed well before 2007, and was not somehow ""immediately scrapped"". It ceased post Fatah -Hamas split, but again, existed before that and represented Palestinians. And Hamas GREATLY outnumbered the seats that Fatah was elected to. A fact you continue to avoid.  ""But I didn't dishonestly make it sound like its something that even existed for most of Palestinian history, rather than being a congress that never even came into session.""

"What Iranian hegemony? You think they are going to take over Middle East and Turkey or Saudi Arabia or Egypt are just going to sit on their arses and watch? The moment they would step outside their borders with anything other than their terrorists proxies they would get stomped by others in the region, even without Israel.  And you might want to research how much influence Israel and their bribes, I'm sorry ""lobbying efforts"" shift US policy before proclaiming military sees an advantage in something or not. As an example, the nuclear deal that took 10 years to reach by multiple countries (that Trump broke in his first term) made everyone happy, except Israel and Netanyahu.

It would require a willfully malicious misread of anything I wrote to get that takeaway.  >And I'm sure this resonate very well on bluesky or liberal college campus. that's about it tho.  I was more looking at raw metrics. There were what, 2 rates of settler terrorism per day in the West Bank in 2022 and it's only gotten worse? The settler army there is now 2-3x the size of ISIS at its peak. They're all directly enabled by Netanyahu and used as a specific part of his strategy. That means it rolls up to him. That right there makes him the most prolific of the modern era by raw attack volumes + terrorists reporting to him.  And then you factor in his involvement with Hamas. As Hamas's main patron who actively worked to maintain their power, he bears partial blame for everything they do, maybe even majority blame. So he gets a share of the blame for every Hamas action on top of his existing West Bank numbers. That puts him in the running for most prolific terrorist warlord of all time and certainly the titan of the modern era.",Sminahin,2025-05-09T14:40:46,2

">ahhh, finally turning back on your initial statement about japanese american sympathizing with arabs?  ...I...oh god. You didn't understand that? Okay, Japanese-Americans were sympathetic for the Arab communities facing discrimination (especially in America) after 9/11. Because we remember how awful it was when everyone turned on us. Japanese internment is widely acknowledged in the US *now* as a cautionary tale and we saw the exact same parallels happening with rampant Islamophobia post-9/11. There's even a section on the parallels at the big Japanese-American museum.  That has nothing to do with cheerleading 9/11. The entire post was in the context of Islamophobia, which was the discussion chain. If you didn't understand that, then I just don't think you're equipped to be having this conversation at all. I don't know why I'm wasting time on a confirmed-racist who's going full YallQuaeda without bothering to read the conversation.  Bye.",Sminahin,2025-05-09T14:53:08,3
