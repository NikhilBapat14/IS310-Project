The damage is done.   He knows how to break things and steal data.  He didn't come here to actually improve anything.,TintedApostle,2025-05-01T16:02:27,58
It’s much easier to break a bunch of stuff and claim victory than to actually do the hard work required to make things better.,Kernburner,2025-05-01T16:04:44,17
Yeah he got everything he needed..so there is no reason for him to stay. 🤷🏼‍♂️,GVTMightyDuck,2025-05-01T16:03:53,16

So do all the techbro DOGE workers have to be put down now?,Shortleader01,2025-05-02T06:18:50,1
"He's got his backdoors set up in every government system, he can fuck up our country remotely now.",Deus_is_Mocking_Us,2025-05-01T18:03:05,17
"> He didn't come here to actually improve anything.  This is the thing. What did he actually accomplish? By objective measures, DOGE did not save any money. They did not increase government efficiency in any way. So what the fuck was the point of all of those building closures, return-to-work orders, mass layoffs, and the stupid weekly 5-points emails?  They claimed to find tons of evidence of fraud and abuse... fraud is a crime. Where are the indictments for fraud? Why aren't the alleged fraudsters being prosecuted for their alleged crimes?  If you commit fraud, getting fired is the least of punishments you should expect. If they had actual evidence of comitting fraud with taxpayer money, that should be a huge deal! So why isn't it?",mediocre_remnants,2025-05-01T19:59:18,8
Elon went into the government to be the first to establish his inferior AI before other companies got a chance. That's my thinking on what he gained from all of this.,Socratic_Method_729,2025-05-01T23:17:30,1
