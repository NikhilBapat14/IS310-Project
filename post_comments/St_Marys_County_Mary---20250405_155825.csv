"Maryland has approximately 160,000 federal civilian employees, representing about 6% of the stateâ€™s workforce, and nearly 225,000 jobs are supported by federal funding contracts.  Hoping these folks are getting up to protest the threats to their jobs and the ability to support their families.",bakeacake45,2025-04-06T16:54:57,1
