"Do you mean the physical seats in parliament?  The procedure may differ per country, but for the Netherlands it is the chairperson of the lower chamber who decides, with input from the political parties themselves. The lower chamber is more than half-round, with six 'slices' of seats, each slice having two seats at the front. Since these are most visible on TV it is tradition that the six largest political parties get at least those seats. All parties are mostly seated left to right according to ideology. Smaller parties get to have access to one of the aisles, so they can easily come to the interruption microphones at the front.  Apparently Iceland assigns seats per lot, thereby mixing candidates of all parties around, which is rather interesting.",PoliticalAnimalIsOwl,2024-06-09T14:36:22,3
"Yah, the physical seats, thank you. Apparently in the US the democrats are seated on the left and republicans on the right?",Torantes,2024-06-09T14:46:57,2
