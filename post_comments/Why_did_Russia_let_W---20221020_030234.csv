"The mercenaries were part of a group that had been firing on Americans located in an agreed upon deconfliction zone.   We have things like deconfliction zones so Russians and Americans donâ€™t accidentally start firing at each other, creating an international incident between nuclear powers. We agree to stay in our zones and Russia agrees to stay in their zones.  So if official Russian forces were firing upon an American deconfliction zone, that could be seen as an act of war.",pluralofjackinthebox,2022-10-28T20:03:00,3
