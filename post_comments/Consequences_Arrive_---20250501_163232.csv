Don’t worry guys they’re still boycotting our raspberries and canceling their vacations to Florida. It’s a revolution really.,Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-05-02T07:32:01,13
Toronto and Montreal put Carney in office. The rest of Canada didn't want him.  It's the same thing that would happen to us if the Electoral College was abolished. California and New York would decide who the president is in perpetuity. And that's scary shit.,social_dinosaur,2025-05-01T17:41:37,105
Canadians didn't give a damn when [Trudeau](https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/nationalpost/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/blackface.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1128&h=846&type=webp&sig=YhRVLn6UVcHeCzx_bZZb5Q) wanted to freeze their citizens banks accounts for non-violent protests. I feel really bad for all the Conservative Canadians who are lamenting this unfortunate choice :(,California-Cowgirl,2025-05-01T18:48:17,69
Canada. Acting every bit like a country that didn't fight for its independence.,TheConvincingSavant,2025-05-01T16:43:48,62
"I've heard people blame Trump, saying his heavy ""51st state"" rhetoric is what scared anywhere from 5-25% of people (mostly Boomers) into voting for Carney.  Somehow I wouldn't doubt that, but godamn, if we're dumb enough that a little bit of ""Trump is gonna get Canada!"" is enough to get us to vote for a **WEF mob-boss**, then we deserve what we get. I can only hope that when weaponized migration and all his WEF policies screw us over, nobody believes him when they go ""it's Trump's fault I'm doing this to Canada!"".  Seriously bruvs, this guy managed the Bank of England, had a hair with Brookfield Asset Management (heavily in-bed with China, and basically a mini BlackRock), and was in bed with the Royal Family, where Prince Andrew (an Epstein client) threw a giant party for him at Buckinghim Palace. Justin Trudeau, in comparison, was WEF Lite and just a puppet - this guy is FULL ON globalist, and will know exactly what he's doing.",NoTime_SwordIsEnough,2025-05-02T03:58:54,10

"Canada is one of several democratic-ish countries where too many of the people will grasp at any excuse to vote left/liberal. France, Germany, Australia seem to be that way too.   Those places need to get so broken that it completely overrides that tendency, before they'll vote to fix anything, even by secret ballot",woailyx,2025-05-01T19:53:13,8

The New Democrat party also saw a total collapse and all their voters went to the Liberals just to make sure to keep the Conservatives out.,Rare_Cobalt,2025-05-01T21:23:51,23
"Honestly, I don’t. I think people should move based on politics. Let America be conservative and Canada be liberal. Liberals can move north and conservatives south.   Then let’s check-in on the country in 50 years.",soldat21,2025-05-01T19:41:36,59
Sounds just like what the French did.,social_dinosaur,2025-05-01T21:29:32,17
They literally arrested the conservative candidate for president when the party was finally polling positively.  The world is so cooked.,Rare_Cobalt,2025-05-01T21:56:28,22
