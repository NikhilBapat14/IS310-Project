"Being excited about voting for someone - or animated enough to vote against someone makes a huge difference down-ballot. Both sides do what they can to increase their turn-out - good picks at the top will bring out more people who will then hopefully just vote a straight ticket, even if they don't recognize the candidates or know what they stand for. Anything that kills enthusiasm for your side will make more people just stay home instead.   I may be ok with Trump, but hate that Vance said X and ,,, well, Trump did pick this guy because he said he reflected his values. ""You know what - this is all so stupid, my state will probably go red/blue anyway and I don't feel as good about voting for this guy anymore so I'm staying home.""",Gertrude_D,2024-07-29T23:25:52,7
"In elections with as low a turnout as we have. Whether people show up for a specific person or proposition can dramatically affect who is also available to vote for or against other things on the same ballot. There’s also what used to be called coattails. Where a popular candidate could get people in your state excited for certain issues, but single issue voting has made that less effective.",ElectronGuru,2024-07-29T23:44:06,3
"Every comment in here so far is asinine.   Yes. Presidential elections at the top of of the ticket drive voter turnout.   In general, during presidential elections, voter turnout is around 66%.   In general, during midterm elections, when Senate, House and state and local elections are on the ballot only, voter turnout is around 40%  That's a difference of tens of millions of people turning out to vote.   Virtually all voters have an opinion of presidential candidates. That is less true in contests for Senate, House, Governor. It's exponentially more true for other state, county and city elections.   99% of people can name their president.  70% of people can name one of their Senators 60% of people can name their governor 50% of people can name their House Representative   The number of people who can name their state House member or city council member, is very small.    Imagine a city who holds its city council election on a random Tuesday in June. No other elections are on the ballot.   Voter participation will be 10% or less.   Imagine that same city holding it city council election on the same as the election for President of the United States.   There will be 7x more people turning out (because of the POTUS election) but this also means that 7x times more people will vote for city council (or might vote for city council)  In this regard - the Presidential election will inevitably impact the results of the local city council election - given that 7x as many people are participating- but also - because many of those voters now participating are ""low information"" voters - people who only turnout to vote in presidential election cycles.   For more on this look up ""under vote"" and ""split ticket voting""  Source: I worked in campaigns and elections professionally for over a decade, with speclization in voter turnout metrics and tactics.",Xing_the_Rubicon,2024-07-30T05:58:50,3
"When the primary is the oldest to ever run, and there are questions about his ability to get through four years, you most certainly are voting for both as a package.",Hoplophilia,2024-07-29T23:15:53,9
"Normally a VP candidate is chosen that will broaden appeal to voters. Vance was chosen to appeal to tech industry donors (Thiel, Musk, et al) and didn't even hit all the targets in that pitch. What's more, he further alienates Trump in a number of demographics. On top of that the things he said against Trump are pretty strong condemnations. That makes it look like he has no spine and just goes with whatever he thinks will be most beneficial in the moment.  TLDR? Vance won't pull a measurable amount of undecided or abstaining voters (and in fact probably alienates more of that demographic than it pulls) and has failed to pull the fundraising he was chosen for.",[deleted],2024-07-30T01:42:35,2
Yes. Identity politics is very much tied to optics. These people vote the ticket. The top of the ticket is more important than the bottom.  This is why DT's first term was such a surprise. The man is a card-carrying pedophile who has bragged about peeping young women and grabbing genitals without permission. He has stepped in every tradition these people hold dear. A proven liar and thief.   Yet there he was.,Justifiably_Cynical,2024-07-30T04:36:27,1
"More than anything, it will affect voter turnout.  If Republicans or democrats  are excited about a ticket then congress will fare better.  ",solid_reign,2024-07-30T08:15:11,1
"I never would've thought about lack of enthusiasm for the main ticket affecting the down ballots. That does make sense, if less people come out who vote straight down without really knowing the other candidates that is a big ripple effect.",NoPomegranate4794,2024-07-29T23:46:07,3
