Not a Doctor Phil spent years exploiting the stupid and poor for views on his show. He humiliated and mocked them for entertainment and gave them small gifts to make it seem okay. The guy is a scumbag just like Trump.,Shiplord13,2025-05-01T17:05:14,63

"I think we should start referring to Trump as 34.  Not 45, not 47 but 34.  Every single time we refer to him.  It'll be a nice way to remind those in the know about the convictions and it's a great way to explain to those why he should be referred to as 34. And it's not an insult the way so many of his nicknames for other people are.  It's simply a reminder, a statement of fact.  He is a convicted felon on 34 fucking counts.",AdventurousSeaSlug,2025-05-01T17:25:43,33

"Dr. Phil has been a trump supporter from the beginning. It has been brothering me how he hides it from the public. I think it was why he stopped his show...to work with trump.  In my opinion, a big part of the reason we have a mentally sick society today is Dr. Phil. It is also likely, IMHO, Dr. Phil has been guiding them in how to ""influence"" or manipulate people. At the very least, his presence gives credence to trump's behavior and actions.  If you watch his shows, you will see a clear bias against women and the so-called lower classes. What he did to many of the people on his show was beyond unethical and inexcusable for anyone who cares about mental health.",TheRealBlueJade,2025-05-01T20:37:53,7
