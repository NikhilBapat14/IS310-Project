"My day job is making toys, has been for nearly 20 years.  A massive snowball coming. His actions will impact everything while companies find new (creative) ways to import goods in order to minimize punitive external costs, and that's something he's very much aware of. In one way or another, our imports will still come from China. Trust me, they will.  So, it begs the question: who is this for and why? It's not for the American people. It's likely not for anyone you know personally. If I had to wager, I'd say it's about a consolidation of power. Perhaps it's more simple: ego.  Shelves will be empty. Jobs will be lost. Pain will be felt. The result he's seeking will be at YOUR expense, without achieving what he's claiming.    Weeks or months from now, he'll stand on his soapbox and claim some sort of symbolic victory. The markets will roar, things will go back to some type of normal, but that'll only come when he actually gets what he wants. Who knows when that will be, and when enough will be enough.  This isn't about freeing ourselves from cheap international manufacturing, we're a capitalist society, we're designed for it, have been from the very start.  Things we produce overseas will NEVER be made here, plain and simple.  It's all about him, his ego, and power.",tommy-vargas,2025-04-30T15:52:45,79

That didn‚Äôt go over well with the public, and he lost to Clinton.  Then, decades later, McCain was in a tight race with Obama.
