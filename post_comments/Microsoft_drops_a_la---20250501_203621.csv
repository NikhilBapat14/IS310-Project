"Agreed. This was such a bad look for the firms that did cave and will surely backfire on them long term. It’s also just such an erosion of norms and further enables Trump’s fascist behavior. Knowing Trump these firms will likely be dealing with his legal woes long after he leaves office (god willing) and maybe even after he’s dead. It was just so crazy to me how quickly so many folded as soon as he got into office. Like zero fight whatsoever. Now, a few months later, it’s obvious they could have weathered the storm. His poll numbers are plummeting and he’s losing legal cases faster than he can direct the DOJ to prosecute them. Just shameful behavior from the firms who did cave. All done because they thought it made “business sense.” Absolutely no balls, and people won’t forget.
