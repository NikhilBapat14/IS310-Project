Remember when the left laughed at the dozens of January 6th defendants who had their due process violated.  You know actual American citizens.    Now they are screeching about an illegal immigrant gang member who supposedly didn't get due process.  It's just so laughable. ,Pinot_Greasio,2025-04-14T14:53:01,83
