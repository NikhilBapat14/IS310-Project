Republicans all bitter because they were conned into the largest peacetime tax increase in American history.,Purify5,2025-05-09T12:27:03,17
Trump doesn't have a fucking clue what a trade deficit is. Both sides can do extremely well even if one side runs a deficit. It's not a zero-sum game. It's a horrendous embarrassment that he's basing our foreign trade on a completely erroneous premise.,barneyrubbble,2025-05-09T12:42:05,13
None of this is economically conservative. But many Republicans are too stupidly to realize it.,ranchoparksteve,2025-05-09T12:38:47,5

"""Conservative radio show host and far-right influencer Erick Erickson blasted the Trump administration’s deal with one its longest and strongest international allies Thursday, likening the minimum rate tariff to permanent taxes on the American people.  “It’s actually a pretty shitty deal with the UK,” [wrote](https://x.com/EWErickson/status/1920502511586148667) Erickson on X. “First, they told us the 10 \[percent\] tariff was just a baseline for negotiations to get to free trade deals. Now we’re being told the 10 \[percent\] tariff is for keeps.  “That’s just a tax on the American people,” he noted.""  I don't know who he is, I just hate clickbait.",Nitramite,2025-05-09T15:27:18,1
