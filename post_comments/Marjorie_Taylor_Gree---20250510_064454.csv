"MTG probably knows that she would likely lose in a statewide election.  She used to live in a suburb closer to Atlanta that she wouldn‚Äôt win, so she carpetbagged to a rural district in northern Georgia.

It is shocking she has the self awareness to know she can't win but not shocking she dropped out because she needs the sweet sweet insider information to keep trading up her portfolio !,dednotsleeping,2025-05-10T16:27:49,1

I noticed the district-hopping representative from Colorado also hasn‚Äôt been seen in the news much.   Maybe they were told to tone it down so as not to take media coverage from dear leader.,txdmbfan,2025-05-10T12:44:01,1

"People forget that she is one of (if not biggest) fundraiser for the republicans in the house. This is why she won the ‚Äúbeef‚Äù with boebert and boebes dropped off. A major portion of her donors are small dollar donors , hence why people/pundits associate her as being ‚Äúcloser to the MAGA base‚Äù.     She‚Äôs an asset as she‚Äôs able to feign dissent (look at what she‚Äôs said recently about the bill redefining antisemitism earlier this week that she vetoed) while not actually showing any dissent that is meaningful or impactful towards the trump agenda. She‚Äôs able to take the flak as the premier MAGA congresswoman that allows the rest of the Republican Party stay silent and unaccountable for their silence in rubber stamping trumps agenda.    She gets her marching orders like the rest of them, she‚Äôs just better than most when it comes to  spewing the slop to their base, and having them eat it up rather than it coming from a random vapid empty suit of a gop congressperson",UgFKLNx,2025-05-10T11:20:16,1
