"Can't ever recall any person who wanted to be respected pulling such a stunt.  Trump is a buffoon through and through.  Does and says whatever he feels, no matter how thoughtless.",Smithy2232,2025-05-06T09:48:53,16
"He has no wit, no humor.  He has never told a joke, he can only insult.  He posted his pope picture thinking his base would love it, because he doesn’t understand religion.  When it falls flat or he gets blowback, he says it’s a joke.  He doesn’t apologize, because he can’t, nor does he think he ever needs to.  He doesn’t function the way normal people function, or have any empathy, which is why he’s such a horrible horrible leader.",dbuck1964,2025-05-06T10:09:14,29
He wasn’t joking. I don’t think I’ve ever seen Trump laugh.,CoachCrunch12,2025-05-06T09:48:51,10
I’m an atheist and found it both disrespectful and disturbing.,[deleted],2025-05-06T10:17:40,8
He wasn’t joking. Also claimed he didn’t know who posted it when it was both on his truth social and the official White House accounts,prguitarman,2025-05-06T09:46:43,17
"Try to imagine just for a moment, if vice pres Kamala had visited the pope who then immediately dies, and then the Biden white house posts an AI image of his as the pope.",inappropriateshallot,2025-05-06T10:14:28,8

Man with worlds thinnest skin says others can’t take a joke when he blasphemes their religion. Pathetic,MidnightWorried6992,2025-05-06T10:58:54,6
"In his mind, *Catholics the world over loved it*.  Some even called him to express their wish he would be anointed.  The rest are just a few haters, bots, and insane liberals.  What he imagines has little resemblance to reality.  But that's nothing new.",Deguilded,2025-05-06T09:54:47,5

"I think it's coverage like this and the star wars stuff that actually helps trump. There are issues worth getting upset about, and this isn't one of them. ",Bakedads,2025-05-06T09:54:19,3
"As a recovering Catholic, I didn't find it amusing. That the president would openly mock a religion to over 1 Billion during a time of grief and reflection, is also not funny.   It's not a joke, this isn't funny.  BE A MAN AND GROW THE F UP!",Comfortable-Pea-1312,2025-05-06T10:56:22,3

"He’s right. I’m not a fan but he was obviously joking. People (the media) need to focus on the actual shitty things he’s doing, not the pope bs. Nobody thinks he‘s actually going to be pope and there’s no way he even wants to be pope. There isn’t much money in that job anyway ",Reasonable-Aerie-590,2025-05-06T13:05:19,1

"Guys...  Unless you are catholic, don't react to this.  Trump and the right do shit like this because they know liberals will come along and white knight the situation.  Their entire operation depends on a steady stream of liberals taking offense to something.",Bob_Van_Goff,2025-05-06T11:13:40,0
