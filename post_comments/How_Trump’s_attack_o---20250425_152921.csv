"As intended, he’s moving on to judges and the press now. The line has been crossed and if he isn’t removed from office, one way or another, the 250th anniversary will be to celebrate the new fascist federation of America",Saber-Rattler-3448,2025-04-25T18:05:23,2
"Do people who don’t work at research universities understand the gravity of the situation? I’ve worked at a small public R1 for 30 years. This is existential. We have a huge effort studying genetic causes of cancer, especially pediatric cancer since most of it is genetic. I have little doubt the main professor working on it will get a Nobel one day. We also do a lot of mrna. Every single research university is contributing to our knowledge to fight disease and spur innovation. Companies rely on universities to uncover these leads. I’ve heard people say that private universities shouldn’t be getting public money, but their research has to operate under the same guidelines as everyone else and make papers and data public. What’s your take on how well this is understood? That we are relinquishing our role as the main innovator in science? Game over?",chiralityhilarity,2025-04-26T11:45:05,2
