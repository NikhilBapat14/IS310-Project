"Ryanair’s billionaire CEO Michael O’Leary doesn’t even give a shit what his customers think, so the idea that some American politician is going to make a difference to him is fucking hilarious.",Worried-Rub-7747,2025-05-03T07:35:57,39
I like how republicans went from “let the market decide” to “we decide the market”.,Luke_Cocksucker,2025-05-03T07:47:15,27
"Isn't Ryanair an Irish company? Our politicians should focus on America, and stop caring what foreign companies do.",xibeno9261,2025-05-03T07:34:55,15
What are they gonna do? Ban them from US airspace? Ryanair doesn't fly to the US anyway. And Boeing with its production woes can't afford to lose airline customers.,sonnyempireant,2025-05-03T08:23:43,8
"There are only a handful of airplane companies for passenger jets. The American one (Boeing) has had numerous issues with safety and manufacturing..... but sure, let's criticize another countries planes.",Fun-Future-4928,2025-05-03T07:38:02,11
So pissing off the rest of the world has real economic consequences after all? I’m shocked.,Azmtbkr,2025-05-03T07:55:45,4
"Delusional dumbass. You want them to buy your planes, don’t start a trade war.",restore_democracy,2025-05-03T08:30:26,4
"If they spent as much time thinking about ways to really IMPROVE America, that would be a blessing. Always trying to bully smaller countries.",confused_ma,2025-05-03T08:49:51,3
"It would seem American grit, ingenuity and expertise have given way to mob-style shakedowns.",biscuitarse,2025-05-03T07:52:09,3
If American politicians are concerned about their job market maybe they should fix the problem rather than to try to interfere in places where they have zero business sticking their oars in.,HorrorStudio8618,2025-05-03T07:57:30,3
Do those planes fall apart midair as well as our Boeings do?,11Booty_Warrior,2025-05-03T08:10:36,3

"OK, so if they buy Airbus it's all good, yes? A220/320/321s would fit the bill quite well.",steve_ample,2025-05-03T08:10:18,1
Get your derrière on RyanAir!,Og76,2025-05-03T08:14:01,1
Looks like it's in the US' control to prevent losing the order to China by dropping the tariffs.,aeppelcyning,2025-05-03T17:59:54,1
"How about how they skipped over ""Americans should buy American"" and went straight to ""The Earth should by ONLY American....or else!""",ERedfieldh,2025-05-03T08:17:18,12
Trump wants to be emperor of the world. He wants to control everyone.,TheVoiceofReason_ish,2025-05-03T08:44:20,4
America First means bullying others,MariosBrother1,2025-05-03T09:41:05,3
"Maybe that's the concern. If this Chinese company stole Boeing IP, then their planes could be just as dangerous!",dmullaney,2025-05-03T08:28:43,7
"Airbus have a backlog of orders, hence Comac, but they are 3 to 6 years away from approval in Europe.",qwerty_1965,2025-05-03T08:44:24,1
"And at the same time as they used tariffs to utterly destroy any and all ability for the US to influence global trade. These idiots don't understand that the US's integration into the global economy gave us *leverage* over the global economy, more than any other country in the world.  And now all of that is gone.",HerbaciousTea,2025-05-03T13:52:56,5
Cough cough Airbus,New_Passage9166,2025-05-03T14:50:27,1
The funny thing is none of us in the rest of the world has any respect for him.  For example when Trump tries to tell us Canadians to do something our first reaction is “get fucked bud.”,Mala_Practice,2025-05-03T09:27:33,3
Then Ireland should send all the data centers back to the US as they all break EU regulations !!!  Not to mention Tax evasion !,nobackup42,2025-05-03T10:01:55,1
"But for less money, so still a win for Ryanair.",restore_democracy,2025-05-03T08:31:03,2
Boeing's problems aren't in design but in manufacturing and maintenance.,BurstSwag,2025-05-03T11:32:21,0
