"I didn't click the link, but I know the town you're referring to. He's already taken it over. The giant Musk bust statue is weird.  BUT! The reason Musk wants this city is because the existing city won't let him close down the public beach and pollute so much. That's the real truth. And honestly, no. Just no. People need a government that is separate from business, especially dominant businesses. This is Exhibit A (beaches, pollution). See history for Exhibits B-Z+.",Strict_Inspection285,2025-05-02T19:18:43,75

"What he wants, he can't buy.  He can buy a town... A property... A place. He can have statues put up.. And call himself Mayor, or Lord, or Count or whatever... Money can buy those things.  What he can't buy is genuine friendship. Bullying his way into a town creates resentment. He is not ""the man of the people"".  He can't buy affection. He knows it. That's why he acts out.",whys-it-so-cold,2025-05-03T07:09:15,2

"The republican leadership has a mission statement called project 2025, the republican leadership presented their mission statement project 2025 to the world at the republican national conference in the summer of 2024. The only agenda for the republican governors and their executive branch is colonization of their state. This agenda will make human trafficking and slavery legal. These governors will not stop and maintain transparency believing their voters want this type of government to take care of them. Fascism is a real form of authoritarian government that does not take care of civilians or their civilizations. Fascism uses medical cruelties penitentiaries and poverty to cull the population. This never changes. Protect the civilians at all costs. The world is watching and understands.",vabch,2025-05-03T08:25:08,1

this is how the tech-bro city states are slowly introduced into US society. once the country is in turmoil the tech-bros will begin salvaging choice cities/areas that they then turn into their own little kingdoms. there are actual plans for that.,JenkinsHowell,2025-05-03T04:12:42,1
