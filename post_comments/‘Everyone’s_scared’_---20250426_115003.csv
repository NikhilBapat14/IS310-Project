"I won't be watching. It's bad enough this gutless president is a no-show, but now no comedian/political satirist? They should just issue a press release for honored recipients and save all the time and money. Especially if they're going to fold like this.",YallerDawg,2025-04-26T14:14:49,58
"I wouldn't mind Obama with his anger translator showed up.  He can announce he's running for a third term and we can watch the fireworks as Trump tries to explain why presidents can't have a third term, while telling his supporters why he should be allowed to have one.",Numerous_Photograph9,2025-04-26T15:44:32,53

Are they still doing that “event?”  What’s the point?  It’s going to be like a proud parent throwing a Sweet Sixteen birthday party for their favorite daughter.  Donald celebrating Donald? Why should anyone else even bother?,AntifascistAlly,2025-04-27T04:41:30,2

"Agreed. Just a bunch of no-shows. Leave him there with only fux gnus, bighead Kirk, baldy Poole, and the no names at oann and newsmax.",YPVidaho,2025-04-26T23:47:41,20
They are actually shameless enough to be arguing that a president who didn’t have two contiguous terms can have a third but someone who has already had two contiguous terms cannot.   Obama does not qualify for their completely made up loophole in the 22nd amendment but Trump does and that’s perfectly obviously fair and if you can’t see that you have Trump Derangement Syndrome and are just in an Obama cult.,specqq,2025-04-26T16:34:23,23
That would be hilarious to watch! Trump would look like a blood red orange with steam blowing out his ears! I love it! 😅,Pretty_Victory_2261,2025-04-26T21:52:47,6

Yea let’s blame comedy instead of Fox and the right wing media brainwashing empire,csaw79,2025-04-26T13:20:10,40
Wow. Worst take ever.  Comedy news is the pretty much the only news actually speaking truth to power at this point.,Perfecshionism,2025-04-26T13:41:34,25
"Gutless journalists not doing their job, throwing out softball questions, deliberately regurgitating misinformation, turning a blind eye and not holding politicians feet to the fire ruined America",eggybread70,2025-04-27T02:18:23,2
"I like what Bill Maher coined, saying that they have Trump Devotion syndrome, which is basically just accepting whatever he says, and worshiping at the alter that is Trump.  But, more on topic, I've seen the contiguous terms argument, and it seems they're adding a hell of a lot of context that is in no way implied in the text, and certainly not supported by anything written about it at the time as to the intent.",Numerous_Photograph9,2025-04-26T17:00:35,9
"Is it really?  Did we really want to outsource the fourth estate to joke writers? Did a five minute monologue by Jon Oliver closed with by a poop joke and an episode of the White Lotus on a pay cable network actually solve any problems, or stop the Republicans from taking power again?",Thumbkeeper,2025-04-26T14:44:18,-20

"> it seems they're adding a hell of a lot of context that is in no way implied in the text, and certainly not supported by anything written about it at the time as to the intent.
