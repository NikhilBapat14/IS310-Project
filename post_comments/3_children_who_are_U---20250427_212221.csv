I deplore what the administration is doing but this is a misleading headline.  The adults who were being deported  signed paperwork to take their kids with them.    Were they afforded the time needed to make provisions for the children to be left in the US with another guardian?  Were they afraid that if another relative showed up to claim the child that the relative would be held and deported too?  Or did they just not have anyone to keep the kids?  Or did they just decide that taking the kids was the best course of action?  We'll never know. The undocumented mothers didn't have the legal counsel that they should have had and who could have spoken for them after the deportation.,Only_Mastodon4098,2025-04-27T22:24:25,2

What other choice did they have?   Deporting a woman is not more important than helping a child with cancer.  Maybe get some empathy,Angrbowda,2025-04-28T06:25:30,1
"Deporting a mother is NOT more important than a child receiving life-saving medical care.  Stop trying to twist this into *anybody* supporting separation of families just to support your racist agenda.  I have no kind words for you.

"Cool. Thanks for taking your mask off and showing us who you really are.  By the way, being undocumented in America is a civil issue, not a criminal one.

A country shall Not measure Action by empathy First place. ITS all about the law. Your US of A law says they are illegal in this country.   Your previous POTUS Had enough time to create a legal Status for those are illegal in the US and Stop Further illegal Migration.   I dont say ITS smart deporting the weakest First instead of chasing the criminals but hey... life isnt perfect and to me IT Looks more Like a PR Activity to create an Environment of fear and Trouble.,Available_Cookie732,2025-04-28T10:40:27,1
