….but pro-Israelis always said that the Gazan land isn’t wanted,kostac600,2025-05-06T13:02:42,3
"They want a friendly nation/group to take it over. They want a buffer zone with Egypt similar to China with the Koreas.   The fact that Trump is making land deals makes me think that he's going to get the US locked into some security arrangement or a new US colony.   It's even worse because it's ""We don't want the land, but we don't want these people to have it either.""",Motodoso,2025-05-06T13:40:03,0
