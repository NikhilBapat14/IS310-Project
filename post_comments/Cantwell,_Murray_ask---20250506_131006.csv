"Huh, imagine some monstrous country making political prisoners of foreign nationals.  Can’t say I will ever again pity any American caught in these circumstances. They cheer for it when it happens to brown people, after all.",sylbug,2025-05-06T14:35:45,5

Maria Cantwell and Patty Murray have asked the White House to help secure his release.  >U.S. Air Force veteran Joseph St. Clair, 33, was last heard from by family members, who live in Kitsap County, before Thanksgiving. His father, Scott St. Clair, said Joseph headed south last year and was working in a language school in Colombia when he was detained by the Venezuelan government.  >Joseph completed four tours in Afghanistan and earned the Distinguished Flying Cross. He came home with post-traumatic stress disorder, and was seeking further treatment for it in Colombia. Joseph’s sibling filed a report with the U.S. Embassy in Colombia in January. The next month, Scott received a call from the consulate saying Joseph had been taken as a political hostage by Venezuelan autocrat Nicolás Maduro’s regime.",Zen1,2025-05-06T13:11:17,1
