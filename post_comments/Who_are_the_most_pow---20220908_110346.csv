"British tabloid media have a significant influence on British politics, particularly when it came to the Brexit vote. British tabloids successfully [linked](https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1525766154958123008/photo/1) Brexit to immigration concerns and [arguably](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcms.13386) [caused](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/tabloid-media-campaigns-and-public-opinion-quasiexperimental-evidence-on-euroscepticism-in-england/F530F8AB25994AD7C4BC1D0CAFAD75CF#) a swing towards voting Leave.   Another very important 'channel' of influence are private schools. In [Truss's cabinet](https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/new-cabinet-poshest-since-john-majors-68-educated-private-schools-1839128) 68 percent of members have been educated in private schools. 35 percent of ministers attended Oxford or Cambridge. In the overall population only 7 percent have been educated in private schools. PPE at Oxford is [famous](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/feb/23/ppe-oxford-university-degree-that-rules-britain) for producing prime ministers and other British politicians.   Of course, private schooling is not cheap. The *average* private school fee is currently [£13,700 per year.](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/oct/08/english-private-school-fees-90-higher-than-state-school-spending-per-pupil) For those completing A-levels this year parents would have had to [pay](https://www.ft.com/content/871ab998-bd4e-4c82-9504-43eae163c2cb) around £179,000 in total for day schools and £365,000 for boarding schools, on average. For those starting private school this year parents can expect to pay somewhere between £218,000 (at 0 percent fee increase) to £414,000 (at 8 percent fee increase) for day schools and £427,000 (at 0 percent fee increase) to £851,000 (at 8 percent fee increase) for boarding schools, on average. And that is before university tuition. As a result, only a section of the British population will be able to afford such an education and reap the benefits thereof later in life.",PoliticalAnimalIsOwl,2022-09-08T16:31:30,11
"Alot of people can candidate for that position since Power comes in 5 types- Influence, Commodity, Information, Belief and Strength but because Great Britain distributes the power in the nation alot of people have powerful voices  No one rules alone- A leader has subjects and keypeople, these keypeople have their own agenda and their support is crucial to leaders reign  A rising key person is Rishi Sunak, the conservatives are the majority so the most powerful under the government pillar(influence focused) must be one of that party",JKdito,2022-09-09T02:58:54,2
"Thank you for the answer! Those were definitely two vectors that I hand’t thought about. I guess having control over the tabloids would give a single person a lot of power. The school system is a bit harder to pinpoint, as it seems that those schools are quite independent from each other and ran/owned by different people",valentinsocial,2022-09-09T03:06:12,3
Thank you,dumbnunt_,2022-09-09T11:32:15,2
What is the Commodity type of power that you mention?,valentinsocial,2022-09-09T03:07:02,2
"The old prime minister Theresa May still have influence in tve party, Lord True is the head represantive of conervative party in the House of Lords, Jake Berry is the Chairman of the Party, Penny Mordaunt is the leader of House of Commons, Wendy Morton is the chief whip of conservatives, Boris Johnson still have presence and influence in the party",JKdito,2022-09-09T03:07:05,2
"And not to go all conspiracy theorist on you, but those tabloids are owned by a very few and very rich individuals. They most certainly have interests of their own and have a voice to influence public discussion.   The school system is indeed on a more abstract level, though Oxford and Cambridge still play an outsized role. Socialization in these institutions (and private schooling) gives these students of course a certain view on the UK and the world that can become entrenched. It also gives them a disproportionate amount of social capital, for example via the Bullingdon Club. I'm sure some researcher will have looked into this from a social constructivist point of inquiry.",PoliticalAnimalIsOwl,2022-09-09T04:58:01,1
"Money or means to distribute goods and money  There are 5 pillars of society- Government, Corporations, Community(Institutes), Church and Gangs- These elements exists in every civilised society more or less, They all have different focus in power but as the government you have to be able to manage all of them- Security(Strength), Finance(Money), Science(Information), Law(Influence) and Cultural(Belief/Tradition)",JKdito,2022-09-09T03:11:00,2
"Following your post, I found this report that you might find interesting - [https://www.mediareform.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Who-Owns-the-UK-Media\_final2.pdf](https://www.mediareform.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Who-Owns-the-UK-Media_final2.pdf)      quote from it: ""Just three companies—DMG Media, News UK and Reach—dominate 90% of the national newspaper market, up from 83% in 2019"". One of those companies is owned by Rupert Murdoch, another by some UK Lord who inherited it and the third one is not run by very famous people",valentinsocial,2022-09-09T05:20:45,2
That sounds like a very interesting framework. Can you recommend some further reading on the topic?,valentinsocial,2022-09-09T05:29:22,2
"Ah, interesting indeed.",PoliticalAnimalIsOwl,2022-09-09T05:52:23,1
"Unfortunately not- This is not an academic theory, its just a viewpoint on how to govern a society properly, creating the balance that pleases and recognises all of the population. In the end its just a theory tbh but in my opinion an accurate one  On youtube CGP Grey made a video ""The rules for rulers"" which explains how Power and politics works but it has very little to do with the things I said, still interesting tho",JKdito,2022-09-09T06:18:42,1
