"I'm a veteran and I think this is wrong. Veterans day is a day that I, and many other veterans and service members, had to earn. We celebrate our living vets with Veterans Day and Memorial Day is to remember our fallen soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen.   However, from a historic perspective, we used to celebrate armistice day on Nov 11th. [wiki link](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armistice_Day)  Kurt Vonnegut shared his thoughts on this too, [Armistice Day has become Veterans’ Day. Armistice Day was sacred. Veterans’ Day is not.](https://www.loa.org/news-and-views/kurt-vonnegut-armistice-day-and-veterans-day/#:~:text=I%20will%20come%20to%20a,sacred%20day%20called%20Armistice%20Day.) My thoughts on this quote is around how Veterans Day has become a day for consumerism and not about our veterans.   We have no one left to celebrate Armistice Day, but we have countless veterans all suffering.   The GOP, Trump, and their supporters have showed us time and time again how much they do not care for veterans. My healthcare with the VA has suffered, my job as a federal employee is threatened, I have lost friends and shipmates with no one trying to fix anything to help us.   Trump is ripping away safety nets from veterans with threatened homes.
