It’s a dog whistle. An old one at that since no one really respect IQ tests they way they used too. IQ was considered an inherit trait that you couldn’t study your way out of and the implication was that certain groups are just “lower IQ” and that the few that do are “exceptional”. We have more or less stepped away from that idea (at least in psychology and sociology) but you still run across the old heads who won’t get with the times and will still try to argue with you that people of color just have lower IQs.
