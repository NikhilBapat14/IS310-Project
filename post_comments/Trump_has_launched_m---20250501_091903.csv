">Through executive orders, agency memos and other policy moves, the Trump administration has deleted a swath of Joe Biden-era green policies, frozen climate spending, removed the US from the Paris climate accords and set about rewriting pollution standards for cars, trucks and power plants.  >Trump’s actions have often explicitly favored a fossil fuel industry that donated heavily to his presidential campaign.  The esteemed academic and Nobel laureate Noam Chomsky nailed it years ago when he called out the GOP for what it is: a globally destructive criminal syndicate, now fronted by Trump and bankrolled by fossil fuel interests.  *""The Republican Party is the most dangerous organization in human history... not only because of their approach to climate change, but because of* ***their hostility to rational thought*** *and their inability to deal with the greatest crisis humanity has ever faced.""*   — Noam Chomsky, May 2, 2017  For decades, the GOP has bent to the will of polluters whose insatiable greed prioritizes short-term profits over humanity’s future — a path as reckless as it is suicidal. That was eight years ago. Since then, they’ve only doubled down on their war against science, reason, and the planet.",haiku2572,2025-05-01T10:18:44,3
