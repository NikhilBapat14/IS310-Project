"I’m actually sad she isn’t.  Would be better for humanity if there were more people who actively could speak up with experience against what is happening.  It seems as Americans, we’ve lost our recollection of history’s lessons and implications some time ago.  Without experiencing first hand, or having those who did around and able to provide a first hand voice and account, I fear that humans are destined to fail and have to relearn hard lessons every 3-4 generations.

"I’m sure you didn’t mean every and all Americans? Many millions of us have not forgotten, even those who do not have Jewish families or even families who sacrificed militarily. It sure seems a lot of the powers that be would like to think they can do the same thing as the fascists did and get a different outcome, which is to your point. And I guess their supporters may have forgotten, but I rather think it’s more that the right wing propagandists are calling everyone not on their side radical militant socialists and so on.",BufordTJusticeServed,2025-04-23T12:49:49,10
