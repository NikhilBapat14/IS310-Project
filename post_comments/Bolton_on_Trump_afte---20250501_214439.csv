"Republicans how could you not know?   **CEO Exxon Rex Tillerson 1st Secretary of State first Trump administration.**   [Rex Tillerson opens up on Trump and his firing: ""We did not have a common value system""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6Rc68FXk-E&t=156s)  >The president would say well here's what I want to do and here's how I want to do.  I'd have to say to him well Mr. President I understand what you want to do, but you can't do it that way, it **violates the law,  it violates the treaty**, you know he got really frustrated.  Also in the interview: After leaving the Trump administration, Tillerson spoke to Bob Schieffer about his tenure: ""It was challenging for me coming from the disciplined, highly process-oriented Exxon Mobil corporation . . . **to go to work for a man who is pretty undisciplined, doesn't like to read, doesn't read briefing reports,** doesn't like to get into the details of a lot of things, but rather just kind of says, 'This is what I believe.",rustyseapants,2025-05-01T21:51:07,13
"It's recency bias, but of all the shit he can be called on...  >For the record, Bolton told Today he won't be voting for either Tï»¿rump or Harris.  He's representative of an old guard that felt it better to go through this, knowing the consequences, than vote for Harris.  None of this is a surprise to him. He spent months warning people not to vote for Trump.",nerphurp,2025-05-01T21:53:25,11

"Not true, everyone knows chaos is the unknown or unrecognizable. 47 has slave master DNA, fascism is an authoritarian government that is well known and established form of government. Fascism ideology is well studied and practiced with bold lines on how the government treats civilians. The fascism government in power does not take care of civilians or their civilization. Uses medical cruelties, and penitentiaries, detention centers and poverty to cull the civilians. The republican leadership and their voters want legal human trafficking and slavery to support their authoritarian government and paramilitaries that enforce crimes against humanity and the penitentiaries. Through this system of government legal human trafficking and slavery of all kinds, children and elderly the most vulnerable, becomes legal, with no judicial system in place for the protection of civilians from their government. The republican leadership presented their mission statement project 2025 to the world in the summer of 2024 during a national republican convention. This republican mission statement is being implemented by the republican governors and their executive branch of state government right now. The republican voters believe slavery and human trafficking will give them a tax free government. The world is watching and understands. Protect the civilians at all costs.",vabch,2025-05-02T09:09:29,1
