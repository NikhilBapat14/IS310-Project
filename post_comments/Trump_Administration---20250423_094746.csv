"Stuff like this isn't nothing, but it isn't much.  One of the thing that really annoys me is that people claim we can't boost birth rates in the west with incentives. The fact is we haven't tried. Instead we claim things like a paltry payment like this or ticky tack crap like tax credits are incentives.  Child birth is dangerous. Child rearing is time consuming and costly. Having children is expensive in every way. Every ""incentive"" proposed and implemented in the west tries to make it less dangerous, less expensive, less time consuming, but it is still an overall negative to your health and economic well being to have children.  You know what I would like to see? Pay people a living wage to stay home and raise kids. Mom or dad or aunt or grandparent; I don't care. Give families $50k for their first and second kid. Make it a real job and career people can aspire to. I know plenty of people who, if they could be paid $100k to stay home to raise their two kids would take it in a heart beat.  And I say this as a person who will never have children. I would gladly pay more in tax to make parenting the real job that it is, because having and raising kids is probably the most important job for our society and like many of those types of jobs we simply expect people to do it out of the kindness of their hearts.",awildstoryteller,2025-04-23T09:57:22,1

Especially because if you just give people 5K for kids but you don't put any kind of price restrictions on there then every health care provider is just going to increase the cost of a pregnancy by 5k.,Deinosoar,2025-04-23T09:50:03,15
