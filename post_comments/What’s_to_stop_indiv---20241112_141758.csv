"> “VT should just provide universal healthcare,” our small population & revenue base makes that exceedingly difficult.  Well....  In 2011, the Vermont legislature passed Act 48, allowing Vermont to replace its current fragmented system--which is driving unsustainable health care costs-- with Green Mountain Care, the nation’s first universal, publicly financed health care system  Vermont's single payer system would have to be financially supported through a payroll tax.  *  12.5 percent in 2015 and 11.6 percent in 2019, including a 3 percent contribution from employees.  -------- In 2014, Vermont's legislator changed the plan and decided that raising state income taxes up to 9.5 percent and placing an 11.5 percent Corp Tax Rate on Business was the only way to fund the expenses.  Calling it the biggest disappointment of his career, Gov. Peter Shumlin says he is abandoning plans to make Vermont the first state in the country with a universal, publicly funded health care system.  > * I have supported a universal, publicly financed health care system my entire public life, and believe that all Vermonters deserve health care as a right, regardless of employment or income. Our current way of paying for health care is inequitable. I wanted to fix this at the state level, and I thought we could. I have learned that the limitations of state-based financing – limitations of federal law, limitations of our tax capacity, and sensitivity of our economy – make that unwise and untenable at this time.  * Today we are releasing the [Green Mountain Care financing report](https://hcr.vermont.gov/sites/hcr/files/pdfs/GMC%20FINAL%20REPORT%20123014.pdf) we developed that led me to the difficult conclusion that now is not the time to move forward with a publicly-financed health care system in Vermont. In the coming weeks we will be publishing additional materials from our research on the website http://hcr.vermont.gov/library. Vermonters will have access to all of the analysis that we used to come to the difficult decision we made. I hope this report gives us a common understanding of the detailed assumptions and facts needed for the work we must do over the coming legislative session to continue long-lasting, meaningful health care reform in Vermont.  >“These are simply not tax rates that I can responsibly support or urge the Legislature to pass,” the Governor said. “In my judgment, the potential economic disruption and risks would be too great to small businesses, working families and the state’s economy.”",semideclared,2024-11-12T20:41:52,5
I think that it would be very difficult to argue that that doesn't fall under 'interstate commerce' which is explicitly stated to be under the purview of the federal government. That would be the biggest legal hurdle I see here.,DanielGoldhorn,2024-11-12T15:04:06,4
My understanding was that Romneycare was replaced by the ACA when that came into being. It doesn't exist anymore since they were essentially the same thing.,anneoftheisland,2024-11-12T17:41:03,1
"Health insurance is legally barred from interstate function.  That's one reason health administration is so expensive for what you get - every one of those health insurance companies has to be a different company in each state with its own policy, rather than one large organization that serves multiple states.  Company infrastructure and actuarial judgments are redundant and cannot support each other with large scale.  Interstate commerce doesn't come into play for health insurance at all because of this.",theRuathan,2024-11-12T15:43:37,7
"Interstate compacts are constitutionally allowed, but require the consent of Congress. Personally I don't think the federal Congress would have a problem with it as long as they're not the ones on the hook for funding.",JudgeWhoOverrules,2024-11-12T16:47:59,3
"Ya, that's why you see Blue Cross of California, Blue Cross of Texas, Blue Cross of Nevada, etc. they are all technically the same company but from a legal perspective, completely different companies as the healthcare laws vary from state to state.",JayNotAtAll,2024-11-12T16:20:00,3

Both parties are against it because it would cut into corp. and insurance company profits.,One_Material_8906,2024-11-13T23:01:48,0
But legally each part is a different entity (you don't see that because it's handled internally and has no effect on the customers. The entity is licensed for each state separately.),DidjaSeeItKid,2024-11-13T00:17:29,2
