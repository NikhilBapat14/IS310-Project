It was the most corrupt in American history during his first administration. Now it's contending for the most corrupt in world history.,alleyoopoop,2025-05-08T13:22:03,158
"Trump posted (May 8th):  ""Many of our allies and friends are celebrating May 8th as Victory Day, but we did more than any other Country, by far, in producing a victorious result on World War II. I am hereby renaming May 8th as Victory Day for World War II and November 11th as Victory Day for World War I. We won both Wars, nobody was close to us in terms of strength, bravery, or military brilliance, but we never celebrate anything—That’s because we don’t have leaders anymore, that know how to do so! We are going to start celebrating our victories again!""  David Frum replied (in part):  ""That post was such a perfect crystallization of the Trump style: bombast, boast, all of it making Trump himself the center of a story that he had nothing whatsoever to do with.  **The statement is unwise and unattractive in all kinds of other ways too.**  It denigrates the sacrifices and heroism of others.  And it turns the tragedy and horror of war into a triumphant narrative that was completely alien to almost all the people who experienced it as nothing but a tale of suffering and waste and cruelty and misery.  ""... as so often when Donald Trump talks about American military history, he emphasizes power and success and triumph and military genius, but always lacking is any mention of the values for which Americans fought.  America didn’t go (to war) to be top nation, to beat and dominate others.  It went to defend things ... regarded as precious.  I think it’s more useful to think about what began the process of reconstruction and reconciliation that occupied the next eight decades: the way in which former enemies became present partners, the way the Germans and the Japanese themselves discovered, in their own defeat, their own liberation because **they came to accept the values for which Americans went into battle.**""",monkeyhind,2025-05-08T13:30:09,48

"If only looking at the first 100 days of his current presidency then it is totally unprecedented in terms of scale of corruption, the many means of corruption, and the enrichment by corruption (money grifted/stolen).   This is simply the first 100 days and so of course we can't say he's reached Putin status or Gaddafi status, or African dictator status, or Saudi status. But if he stopped right now he's made estimated billions in a little over 3 months exclusively by being the President, and would not and could not have without being the President.   Scale, the various means, and the actual money, and within 100 days, are absolutely unprecedented in modern world history. And I'd honestly be curious if anyone has other similar examples.   Berlusconi is comparable but I don't think there's evidence of corruption that comes close to this during his time in power. Orban is comparable but nothing close to this in actual terms and time frame. Hamas leaders have taken 2 decades to steal their billions. African dictators alsp require military action and decades to steal their billions.",crossdtherubicon,2025-05-09T06:03:38,3

"Do you even know what corruption means?   It doesn't mean policies that don't work as intended, and it sure as hell doesn't mean that people in countries we have no control over didn't act the way we wanted. It means using your office to enrich yourself or your cronies. Trump just held a $1.5 million per plate dinner for fat cats, he started a crypto scheme for himself after defanging the laws against money laundering, etc. There is NO comparison between him and Obama, who couldn't put mustard on his hot dog without MAGA going nuts.",alleyoopoop,2025-05-08T18:17:40,9

"Trump avoided military service.  He has little to no respect for veterans who actually served.  He doesn't really respect the current military either since he chose to fire many high ranking because they opposed things he was doing.  He absolutely hates losing and continues to use his presidency to force people to give him praise and of course to fill his pockets.  Any president with any intelligence at all will do what's best for their people, Trump only does things for self interest.  He will sink the ship and ride his ego all the way to the bank.  ",arilupe,2025-05-09T05:28:09,3

"Lol….. Now do Biden family members….. According to U.S. House Oversight Committee records and testimony, Hunter Biden and James Biden were involved in multiple foreign business dealings while Joe Biden was Vice President. Bank records subpoenaed by the committee in 2023 show over $20 million in payments from Ukrainian, Chinese, and Romanian entities to shell companies connected to the Biden family. The committee also presented an FBI FD-1023 form alleging that an executive from Burisma (a Ukrainian energy company) claimed to have paid $5 million each to Hunter and Joe Biden in exchange for influence.
