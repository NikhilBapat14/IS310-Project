"Finally, some 'common sense' in NC. TY Justice Myers. Congratulations Justice Riggs!",TheRealJenneJ,2025-05-06T04:14:07,31
"So, the question now is just how far Republican losers of elections are willing to go to perpetuate (and perpetrate) this sort of attempted election fraud...   The judge in this case - a trump-nominated one, as it happens - correctly panned the loser's attempt as a cheat, referencing the election rules at the time of the election,  >You donâ€™t change them after the game is done  ... but stayed the order to the BOE to certify - for 7 days - giving Griffin (the loser) a chance to stretch this out even longer if he chooses to appeal. Given that this decision was a trump nominee, I'm hoping Griffin won't be so stupid as to keep up the (attempted) theft. But then, I did have earlier hopes against Griffin being that stupid after the election, and then again after the first recount, and then again after the second recount, and after each of the losses in court - but then, he is GOP - so I won't assume that he'll ever learn.",phosdick,2025-05-06T07:23:42,21
And SCOTUS is ready to disagree whenever the Republicans are ready to move the appeal there.,thieh,2025-05-06T04:26:51,5
