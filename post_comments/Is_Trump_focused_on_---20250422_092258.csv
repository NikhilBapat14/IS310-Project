His idol screwed around with a series of Ukrainian elections so probably?,TheViolaRules,2025-04-22T09:24:07,20
Didn‚Äôt he single-handedly save the Liberal Party‚Äôs chances?,Independent-End-2443,2025-04-22T09:33:46,10
"He‚Äôs so against other countries meddling in US elections, but just fine with the US to do so.",AKMarine,2025-04-22T09:29:09,6
"Sadly, he screws with the Canadian election by staying silent on his expansionist ambitions. He knows that PP would be a favorable government - or at least weaker in the face of threats to Canada.  But he also knows that every time he opens his mouth he drives voters to Carney.   Expect expansionist rhetoric to start back up in April 29th.   Keep your skates laced.

"If Trump has even the smallest, itty bitty *inkling* of political savvy, he'll already know his presence has completely torpedoed the chances of ""his guy"" being elected up here and will stay away as far as possible until the election.  A few short months ago, everyone was absolutely sick of Justin Trudeau, the liberal party, and the Cons were looking to win in the largest landslide ever in Canadian political history. They were projecting over 240 seats at one point which is just insane.  Queue Trump. [Here's how the map looks like now](https://338canada.com/) - The largest landslide has turned into the biggest political turnabout ever solely because of Trump's actions. If Pierre actually lost this election, it would probably be the craziest event in Canada's history since it was almost inevitable he was going to win just a few short months before this.",LargeSnorlax,2025-04-22T09:31:15,7
He already has. And it looks like it's to our benefit.,biscuitarse,2025-04-22T10:56:02,2
"Donald Trump already accidentally massively influenced the Canadian election, just not in the way he wanted to.",smp7401,2025-04-22T09:40:53,1
"I think in his head Trump wants to be the first earth dictator, I believe that is his goal. We are living in a bad comic book storyline but with no superhero‚Äôs to save the day.",Only-Draft-6182,2025-04-22T09:46:13,1
"I listened to the interview and could only conclude that Eric Ham had been personally briefed for the interview by White House Propaganda Minister, Karoline Leavitt. In particular his assertion that Trump would prefer that Canada re/elect a Liberal government is a laughable ploy by Conservatives to imply that PP would be a stronger choice that Trump is playing along with.",blue_quark,2025-04-22T11:02:12,1
"Yes he is,his arsehole never closes.",Great_Ad4198,2025-04-22T11:11:11,1
"The pro trump candidate was projected to win by a landslide, until Trump started opening his mouth about Canada. Now the Liberals are projected to win in a landslide (2 months ago many polls had them in a distant 3rd place lol).   He screwed around, but it backfired spectacularly.",Salsa1988,2025-04-22T09:29:27,20
"Yep. The Liberal Party ended up getting a bunch of momentum, and the economic war effectively allowed them to ""rally around the flag"".  It also hurt the Tories as they're ideologically similar to the GOP, and that attachment has dragged them down.",jayfeather31,2025-04-22T09:42:55,9
"Not single-handedly, as the switch from Trudeau to Carney did a lot more good for the Liberal image than anyone expected it would. But yes, it had a huge impact on the landscape of the election.",Colyer,2025-04-22T11:24:17,2
"He's not at all against other countries meddling in the US election if it favors him. Reminder he's asked for it in the past: ""Russia if you are listening....""",nkassis,2025-04-22T09:37:28,7
And that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs been very quiet lately and hasn‚Äôt talked about the 51st state.,m0ezart,2025-04-22T10:13:53,2
Oh for sure everything he touches turns to shit,TheViolaRules,2025-04-22T09:52:58,6
The problem is Trump saw that initial polling and thought ‚Äúwow. Canada must love me. And why would they want to be ruled by someone like me when they can just be ruled by me. Time to talk about taking over their country‚Äù,No_Algae1379,2025-04-22T09:36:51,9
"Distant third? Gonna need citation on that, Liberals were definitely not polling behind the NDP on projected seat count.",Colyer,2025-04-22T11:21:30,2
So very many things that would have insta-killed any other politician's career.....,ERedfieldh,2025-04-22T09:52:11,4
That‚Äôs why his current marriage is still working. He hasn‚Äôt touched Melania in years.,stonertboner,2025-04-22T10:10:22,4
"Maybe not distant, but various polls had the Liberals either tied or slightly behind the NDP before all of this started. It was even looking like the Bloc might surpass them. It's pedantic anyways... the Liberals were facing complete collapse.",Salsa1988,2025-04-22T11:51:38,2
