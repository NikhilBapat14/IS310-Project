In reality Obama picked a veep that wouldn't outshine him and make him look like not the star of the show. Then Biden did the same thing. Then Kamala did the same thing. And we're pretty far below best available by now.,_Diggus_Bickus_,2025-04-30T10:09:25,51

"The code switching is less offensive to me than the fact that Kamala thought walz, of all people, represented your average white male.  It's almost as out of touch as a man picking Dylan mulvaney to speak to women.",Shadeylark,2025-04-30T11:10:16,13
Another stunningly bad decision by Harris. Jazz-hands Walz worked out well for us though.,WPWeasel,2025-04-30T09:52:25,38

"From the article:    Walz said Harris chose him, in part, because, ""I could code talk to White guys watching football, fixing their truck"" and ""put them at ease."" The Minnesota governor described himself as the ""permission structure"" for White men from rural America to vote for Democrats.   ""I think I'll give you pretty good stuff, but I'll also give you 10% problematic,"" Walz added when pushed by moderator Brittany Shepherd, ABC News national political reporter, about why he didn't take that message to cable news to reach a larger audience.",Theloripalooza,2025-04-30T10:25:05,20

"I don't doubt that Walz was there to balance the ticket as a midwestern white guy, but wow, was he ineffective at communicating to dudes.  Harris was om a frustrating place, but Walz was singularly terrible at communicating with his fellow white men. He came off as only slightly more capable of communicating with other human beings than Harris, and she was one of the worst ever.",thatrightwinger,2025-04-30T13:15:40,3

Biden was way better.  He picked Kamala so it would as difficult as possible to 25th him.,goinsouth85,2025-04-30T11:26:52,34
Walz was pick FOR Harris not by her. They wanted someone who appeared more centrist to offset Harris‚Äôs extreme left views. They thought Walz would appeal to the pro military/ gun owners crowd but obviously failed miserably when he got called out on the stolen valor and the fact that he looked like a complete buffoon trying to hold a shotgun. After that he was Biden lite with the gaffs and other stupid shit coming out of his mouth.,These-arent-my-pants,2025-04-30T13:16:06,18

"Researchers refer people talking in different accents and slang depending on the group to which they're trying to appeal as ""code switching"".  On a benign level, this is done as part of social context. You don't speak to your boss the way you speak to your family, for instance.  On a malicious level, it's done by politicians, pop stars, etc. to try to appeal to them on their level. Reference John Kerry asking, ""Can I get me a hunting license here?""",squunkyumas,2025-04-30T11:02:25,23
