"Prime day historically has always sucked and would make fake price points and discounts. I stick to 3 camels for price tracking, though some discounts won't appear on items where the seller uses discount coupons, effectively hiding the sale price from the tracker (these will be niche brands from one seller or just smaller brands that exclusively sell on Amazon).",AsherGray,2025-05-02T16:15:24,1
