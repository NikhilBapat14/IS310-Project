High wages of nearly $50 hr to drive a van and deliver packages probably didn't help. ,Other-Net-3262,2025-04-30T07:07:48,-21

"Bruh. What drugs are you on?  One of my best friends has been driving for ups for YEARS. They've never even made CLOSE to that amount of money. Hell, I think they're still under half of that.  All you Trumpettes smoke crack.  Edit: Cute, blocking me so I can't respond. Real fucking Trump loving pos.",IUseHamsAsShingles,2025-04-30T07:31:56,14
"Maybe the semi drivers, or pilots, if anyone. The van drivers are probably making somewhere over 20 depending on state. If you want to have your online orders, you can also shut up about the pay they get. Don't disrespect service workers, especially if you rely on their services.",Classicman269,2025-04-30T08:28:16,7

I was a dispatch supervisor and some could make overtime around $42-52$ per hour. Happened a lot during Covid holiday season. The drivers would eat up any overtime they could get. Corporate tried to clamp down where they could but the higher seniority drivers made way more than me who was essentially 2nd to the OM of the center.  Average high seniority driver makes 80-100k per year depending on seniority while I was there.  That’s the typical brown truck driver,OmUndertheBodhi,2025-04-30T12:02:07,1
