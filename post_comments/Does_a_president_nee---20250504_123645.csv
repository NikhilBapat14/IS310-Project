I have family members that recently started believing due process shouldn‚Äôt apply because undocumented immigrants ‚Äúdon‚Äôt care about the law so why should we‚Äù.

"They didn‚Äôt ask him whose constitution . Bible only counts when he selling one. When he is saying, I don‚Äôt know , that means no as it is clear he wants to be a dictator. His first wife said the only book he ever read was Mein Kampf . Hitler was genius compared to him . He is a want to be Mussolini ., doesn‚Äôt even have cards for that. He lives in the past with only three goals money , revenge and narcissism. I fear we are in for more Kent States in the near future.",Adept-Procedure4555,2025-05-04T15:28:33,1
"This type of shit (along with a massive pile of other shit) is why I have zero respect for any person claiming to be a patriot, who is in the military. you swore enough to uphold the constitution. It's the constitution first, then the president. Also, the ""enemies, both foreign and domestic"" part of the oath.  The president is not the constitution, and one clearly proceeds the other. Anybody who is in the military and is not actively doing everything they can to fight all of this crap is a coward and has no honor. I usually don't throw around the ""honor thing, but I'm only doing it in this case, because it's such a bullshit signpost that those in the military love to throw around. Coming from a military family, I see this treasonous cowardice a lot. At best, it's a ""not my problem"" response; to which I always think ""you fucking took an OATH that says it's your fucking problem""‚Ä¶",bamboob,2025-05-04T15:34:30,1

This feels like George W. moment of not wanting to get caught admitting something and trying to maneuver around it.
