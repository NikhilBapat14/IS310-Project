Considering that these ""arrests"" to remove ""dangerous criminals"" from society, to counter a ""foreign criminal organization attempting to strike at the heart of democracy"", have exclusively targeted non-criminals, visa-holding students, children and other *unarmed and peaceful* individuals, probably not for a long time.  If they do encounter resistance while breaking into someone's home, it'll be because they broke into the wrong home.  They're more likely, however, to be aerated when conducting a black-bag operation out on the streets, since they refuse to identify themselves and have threatened to prosecute anyone who asks them for identification or attempts to prevent them from abducting people.  Someone *is* going to believe they see a kidnapping in progress and open up on them.  And *that*, I can't wait to see.

"Here's a quote from an article by Lon Fuller, former professor of Jurisprudence at Harvard.   Is it all starting to sound familiar yet?   Or will the frog stay in the pot until the water is already long boiling?   >**Hitler declared that during the Roehm purge “the supreme court of the German people . . . consisted of myself""**  > In the first place, when legal forms became inconvenient, it was always possible for the Nazis to bypass them entirely and “to act through the party in the streets.” **There was no one who dared bring them to account for whatever outrages might thus be committed.**  >**In the second place, the Nazi-dominated courts were always ready to disregard any statute, even those enacted by the Nazis themselves, if this suited their convenience or if they feared that a lawyer-like interpretation might incur displeasure “above.”**  >... , **what in most societies is kept under  control by the tacit restraints of legal decency broke out in monstrous form under Hitler.**   >Indeed, so loose was the whole Nazi morality of law that it is not easy to know just what should be regarded as an unpublished or secret law. Since unpublishedinstructions to those administering the law could destroy the letter of any published law by imposing on it an outrageous interpretation, there was a sense in which the meaning of every law was “secret.” **Even a verbal order from Hitler that a thousand prisoners in concentration camps be put to death was at once an administrative direction and a validation of everything done under it as being “lawful.”**  And regarding your question specifically:  >After the collapse of the Nazi regime the German courts were faced with a truly frightful predicament. It was impossible for  them to declare the whole dictatorship illegal or to treat as void every decision and legal enactment that had emanated from Hitler’s government. Intolerable dislocations would have resulted from any such wholesale outlawing of all that occurred over a span of twelve years. On the other hand, it was equally impossible to carry forward into the new government the effects of every Nazi perversity that had been committed in the name of law; any such course would have tainted an indefinite future with the poisons of Nazism.   >This predicament — which was, indeed, a pervasive one, affecting all branches of law — came to a dramatic head in a series of cases involving informers who had taken advantage of the Nazi terror to get rid of personal enemies or unwanted spouses. If all Nazi statutes and judicial decisions were indiscriminately “law,” then these despicable creatures were guiltless, since they had turned their victims over to processes which the Nazis themselves knew by the name of law. Yet it was intolerable, especially for the surviving relatives and friends of the victims, that these people should go about unpunished, while the objects of their spite were dead, or were just being released after years of imprisonment, or, more painful still, simply remained unaccounted for.  >The urgency of this situation does not by any means escape  Professor Hart. Indeed, he is moved to recommend an expe¬  dient that is surely not lacking itself in a certain air of despera¬  tion. He suggests that a retroactive criminal statute would have  been the least objectionable solution to the problem. This statute  would have punished the informer, and branded him as a criminal,  for an act which Professor Hart regards as having been perfectly  legal when he committed it.  >On the other hand, Professor Hart condemns without qualification those judicial decisions in which the courts themselves undertook to declare void certain of the Nazi statutes under which the informer’s victims had been convicted. One cannot help raising at this point the question whether the issue as presented by Professor Hart himself is truly that of fidelity to law.

"Don't think ""high"" in the sense of higher on the severity ladder - 1st degree is above 2nd degree or murder above manslaughter above battery, and so on.  Instead, think ""high"" in the sense of 'affecting the highest of ideals and standards' - if a former, now ascended VP pardons himself for having killed his predecessor President, that it was murder is less constitutionally significant than it being an usurpation of proper governance and an irreparable change in the dynamic.    There would never again be any reason for any Presodent to trust their VP, or vice-versa; consider that the Constitution actually requires there be a VP concurrent with the Presidential election - in fact in many ways, they are impossible to separate.  Unless you were TRULY committed friends, a VP might want to kill the President instantly because they'll ascend to the Presidency and just pardon themselves and 'get away with it.'  A President would then be motivated to do the same thing since they could also pardon themselves.  And then it would become a matter of loyalty for other actors that would quickly and easily tear the country apart.  This is the kind of thing that impeachment was intended to prevent, and it was intentionally vague to ensure bad actors didn't destabilize the country, or God forbid the world, by embracing technicalities to commit atrocities.

"We only have the order because we were sick of having to use violence as a society. The order breaks down? Violence returns. Give Common Sense a read sometime, it's not very long, but incredibly influential.  To quote Benjamin Franklin: ""Impeachment is the alternative to assassination"", this was because it offered a way of removing public officials, in a world where the Kings and Queens had absolute power, and those royals and their ministers could only be removed via death or threat of death (forced abdication). When no amount of public outcry could change a royal's mind? Violence has always followed.   So in a literal sense, it was the alternative.   If the alternative, being the systems of laws, fails continually for long enough? Violence WILL ensue.  Even if they're going to ignore the 1st, 4th, 6th, 7th, and 8th amendments, they'll find they can't ignore the 2nd.  Not advocating for any amount of violence, just agreeing that it's going to happen like you say.

"1. Because he won't be dissolving the state governments that agree with him, not at first.  2. Because each state has its own army and air force (the National Guards and Air National Guards), composed of citizens of those states, that take orders from their governors for *just* this kind of occasion. Dissolving a state on paper doesn't magically make these guards no longer loyal to their elected governor. So if he tries to dissolve a state government, you're right back at civil war - and probably with other states that weren't ""dissolved"" but would be next on the list.  It's important to remember that the US has a lot of mechanisms meant to avoid both ~~time~~ rule by tyrant and civil war. 30% of the population voted for all this, 30% against, and ~~60%~~ 40% of the population stayed home on election day. What you're seeing now is the 30% that voted against this are trying everything that was meant to avoid civil war and facilitate checks, balances, and peaceful exercise and transfer of powers. If/when those fail, *then* is civil war and hoping that most/enough of that ~~60%~~ 40% is on the side of sanity/at least not against them.   And if it does come to civil war, the ~~same~~ sane and progressive people in this country will likely need support from America's old allies, too, both during and after such a war, and during the rebuilding of the infrastructure and the government itself. And it will be in these ally's interest, too, because if the maggots win in the end, it'll mean another power in the world that is hostile to every functioning democracy out there - one with thousands of nukes and the largest military ever.  Basically, Trump has been blowing past the federal red lines. Mostly because his party controls all the branches of government and they're letting him do it. He's yet to even test any of the state governments, not even the ones controlled by the GOP.

"They don't have to certify it. The constitution covers such an eventuality. Everything comes down to who will let them violate the constitution and not fight back. In short, who will the military obey?   The constitution says the new president's term begins on Jan 20th at noon. The new Congresspeople begin their terms on Jan 3rd. So let's say we get the point where the state electorates travel to Washington and cast their votes and the Senate has to certify. FIRST the Corrupt Caucus would have to have been reelected with enough of a majority to hold up the certification. Second, if no president is declared by Jan 20 at noon, the Speaker of the House takes the oval office temporarily. The sitting president does NOT get to continue in the role of president by default.   Right now the speaker is Mike Johnson. He's a Christian nationalist and some people will think he's a great fit for the oval. But the vast majority will not be okay with him assuming the role when someone else was elected to it. Plus, there is likely to be a new speaker by then.  Whoever holds the position of president according to the constitutional order of succession becomes the Commander in Chief of the military. And that's what REALLY matters. Would the military stand by or assist Mike Johnson as he stole the oval office from a rightfully elected person? Yeah, I doubt that very much.",MommyLovesPot8toes,2025-04-28T10:05:41,1

You'll have to pay the administrative fees of $32.50 2 weeks after your class when you come pick up your permit in person. ($250 is a typical cost for a class with live fire training, because you're paying a private instructor at a private range. No, the state will not provide either of those)   Uh, no sorry, that's what it costs and we don't have any discounts.  Sorry ma'am, it's state law, and we have to follow it.

Yes, part of the reason they did it was a chance at ousting Biden, but the main reason was to normalize impeachments.

If Democrats follow suit there's a one hundred percent chance that zero will pass right now.  So not only will it normalize impeachments further, but it'll make Democrats look even worse in the eyes of Republicans because to them the Dems are essentially just flailing about ineffectually.

I know about the protests that have happened and it's a good start but that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about millions in the streets in DC. Not scattered protests across the country that can be easily dismissed despite adding up to solid numbers. I'm talking disruptive(from sheer numbers) protests.  I think that would be way more effective than someone getting into a  shootout with ICE that would just end with you dead and nothing changing. Because if you think enough people are going to get into a shootout with ICE to achieve anything I think you are very wrong.  What you are saying is a good way to sound serious about things but I just don't think it would achieve anything. And maybe you don't have kids to care for or don't care if you die what will almost certainly be a pointless death but I know I'd rather have people like you fighting in a way that I think could actually help effect change.  If we show that we will not accept this and have *mass* protests where millions and millions of people are there then we can see something happen. If 10 million people show up in DC and fill the streets maybe congress will grow a backbone. Or maybe that triggers Trump to do something crazy and escalate in a way that shows everyone how much of a facist he actually is.,Illadelphian,2025-04-28T18:22:26,1

Then some right wing radicals took over the NRA and they spent decades changing the narrative to make it so suddenly, no, the 2nd amendment's actually always been about individual gun ownership. It wasn't even until 2008 that the supreme court actually said the 2nd amendment was about individual gun ownership.  The context behind what constitutes the militia in an era where they just had a whole war for their independence is so far removed from any modern context where states don't have their own militias anymore.

"That’s not how qualified immunity works at all.   Qualified immunity provides immunity from criminal prosecution/civil suit for qualified actions taken by government officials in their day-to-day routines.   So, as an example, a person gets accused of a crime, goes to trial, and is ultimately acquitted by a judge since they didn’t opt for a jury trial. Then, guy goes out and hurts someone committing another crime. The victim of that second crime cannot sue the judge for letting him go on the first crime, because finding guilt/non-guilt in a court proceeding is a qualified duty of that judge.   Another example, punching people in the face is, generally speaking, illegal, yeah? But cops punch people in the face all the time (rightly or wrongly). The person being punched (assuming it was in the process of an arrest and not some random haymaker on the street) cannot sue the cop for punching him, and the justice system cannot prosecute him, for what would otherwise be a clear battery charge, because it was done in the course of their qualified duties in order to *complete* their duties.   Then, the reasonableness standard is kinda getting misused here. The basis here isn’t whether something is “reasonable to believe,” but if a (hypothetical) “reasonable person” (mentally translate that to “average Joe”) would believe it.   So, in a case like this, the AG can publish a memo saying that it is legal and constitutional for government employees to sic leopards on people in order to eat their faces. But a reasonable person either would, or *should*, know that’s incorrect.   And I include “should” intentionally because that’s how the law is written. Just because a “reasonable person” *doesn’t* know something doesn’t mean they shouldn’t. We’re largely talking about obvious things, like “murder is bad,” and “people shouldn’t steal,” and “you need evidence to prove a crime,” and even “the constitution makes clear what is required to enter a person’s private residence.”  This memo won’t help anyone.",WisconsinHoosierZwei,2025-04-27T22:45:07,2
"Convicted felons lose their 2A rights, so if the DV is a felony, it should be automatic. I'd go along with people convicted of any violent crime (of course, that is contextual) whether it's a felony or not should have extra scrutiny applied.   Universal background checks, that include military records and all state records, is fine too.   The gun show loophole is a myth to spread fear. Anyone selling firearms has to abide by state and federal law. If private sales without background checks are legal in your state, then it'll be the same at a gun show. But if background checks are required for any transaction, you can't get around it by going to a gun show. They have to follow the laws.  The problem is all the laws being put on regular people that want to exercise their rights, while someone who can't pass a background check isn't gonna let that stop them from getting armed.   If you want to verify someone is who they say they are, strengthen the background check system. If you want to reduce gun violence, make it hurt when committing a crime with a firearm. No more plea bargains or chance for parole. I don't like the idea of the US justice system throwing more people in prison, but people who aren't committing crimes in the first place shouldn't be punished by bans.

Militia: composition and classes (a) The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in section 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become, citizens of the United States and of female citizens of the United States who are members of the National Guard.  >(b) The classes of the militia are—  >(1) the organized militia, which consists of the National Guard and the Naval Militia; and  >(2) the unorganized militia, which consists of the members of the militia who are not members of the National Guard or the Naval Militia.  >Presser vs Illinois (1886)  >It is undoubtedly true that all citizens capable of baring arms constitute the reserved military force or reserve militia of the United States as well as of the States, and, in view of this prerogative of the general government, as well as of its general powers, the States cannot, even laying the constitutional provision in question out of view, prohibit the people from keeping and bearing arms, so as to deprive the United States of their rightful resource for maintaining the public security, and disable the people from performing their duty to the general government.   >It wasn't even until 2008 that the supreme court actually said the 2nd amendment was about individual gun ownership.  Because it was never challenged until 2008. Individuals could purchase arms unconnected with the militia prior to 2008.

Thats true for the big populous dem states like ca and ny too, they have more registered gun owners than registered republicans by far.  Folks on the left are less likely to make guns their sole, whole personality, so its easy to get the impression they are simply not gun owners as a group when the right is loudly squawking about guns all the time and no lefty ever is, except privately and online where we encourage others to take up the hobby lol.

You're right. I don't need anyone to tell me how it ends. I don't need people in other countries telling me I'm not doing anything. I understand it's in our hands. I'm not a fucking idiot. We don't need people who don't live here reminding us how fucked our situation is and pretending like they would act differently and they would be fucking Rambo if this was happening in their country.,chewy92889,2025-04-27T20:17:24,4
"How would my leaving fix things? I'd have moved my family away from harm, i'd not be actively contributing financially to a genocide on trans people, work (death) camps for brown people, waging an economic war on my allies, and threatening to invade my neighbors. The governments resources don't magically spring up from no where.   If you want to take a more active role, while you don't as evident but the way you are acting, you can take or not take my advice to look into how it has been done successfully in the last century. Your personal skills, your personal knowledge, your personal location, all matter, i can't tell you what those are. I can't tell where you can disrupt things that won't hurt people but will be a major pain for the gov't, I cant' tell you ways to hurt people directly who are involved as I don't know who they are around you or what they do or what they care about.   What I do know is waving a sign and shouting a slogan and giggling about trying to 'piss off' trump wont' do jack and or shit while you continue to contribute to the horrors that are only going to get worse.

"To answer your edit since you’re saying I’m not engaging with what you’re saying, are you implying I should jeopardize my career by causing mass amounts of chaos before getting terminated? Sorry, I just don’t understand the sentence “…sending brown people to death camps phones working letting them make their calls to push their actions.” That sentence structure kind of fell in on itself.  Trust me, I’d love to have an out where I can just hold my taxes until the government stops being a sore sack of shit on the world, but it turns out the only way you can do that is perjury if you aren’t tax-exempt. Not going to federal prison while this guy is in office is a goal of mine as I fancy not getting disappeared.  And I get just as many of the younger generation of phone users coming in with their phones not working than older folk complaining that their Fox News propaganda app isn’t working. Surprise surprise, I can, and am encouraged to, help the younger generation get their service back. I am obliged by the company I work for, and my morals in this case, to refuse to service any apps we don’t officially produce.   I’ll play your game. Canada is directly responsible for providing lumber to the United States for the past few years until tariffs hit. This lumber has likely been used to build the offices ICE and Trump’s administration will be working out of.

If a bartender keeps serving shots to someone who's clearly about to drive drunk, we hold them partly responsible for what happens next.
