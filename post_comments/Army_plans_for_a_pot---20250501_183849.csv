"You know this number isn't a coincidence right?  Books of the Bible: There are 66 books in the Christian Bible. This number signifies the completeness of the Christian scriptures, with 39 books in the Old Testament and 27 in the New Testament.  Mark of the Beast (in popular culture): While 666 is traditionally associated with the number of the Antichrist, some interpretations see 66 as a precursor or a derivative of this number.  Symbol of the Church: In some Christian interpretations, 66 can symbolize divine order and completion due to the number of books in the Bible.  The Lost Gospel: Some conspiracy theorists and alternative religious movements believe that there was a ""66th book"" of the Bible that was lost or hidden by early church authorities. This book is sometimes said to hold forbidden knowledge about the true nature of Christ, God, or the afterlife. Some even suggest that the ‚Äúmissing book‚Äù was deliberately suppressed to control the masses.",TintedApostle,2025-05-01T18:55:50,-3
