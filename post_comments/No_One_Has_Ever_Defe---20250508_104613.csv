"Well, we didn’t get here by accident. Did we New York Times because you couldn’t be bothered to report the truth or the news because God forbid you were in fear of Trump and his retribution so you actually have done not only the American people but the world a disservice",SoundSageWisdom,2025-05-08T11:31:14,15
"From the article:  America has crossed the line into authoritarianism. The Trump administration’s weaponization of government agencies and actions against critics has raised the cost of opposition for a wide range of Americans.  For many American citizens and organizations, the cost of opposition has risen markedly. Although these costs are not as high as in dictatorships like Russia, America has, with stunning speed, descended into a world in which opponents of the government fear criminal investigations, lawsuits, tax audits and other punitive measures and even Republican politicians are, as one former Trump administration official put it, “scared” out of their minds “about death threats.”  So far, American society’s response to this authoritarian offensive has been underwhelming — alarmingly so.  The acquiescence of our most prominent civic leaders sends a profoundly demoralizing message to society. It tells Americans that democracy is not worth defending — or that resistance is futile. If America’s most privileged individuals and organizations are unwilling or unable to defend democracy, what are ordinary citizens supposed to do?  The costs of opposition are surmountable. And importantly, the descent into authoritarianism is reversible. Pro-democracy forces have successfully resisted or reversed backsliding in recent years in Brazil, Poland, Slovakia, South Korea and elsewhere.  When the most influential members of society fight back, it provides political cover for others. It also galvanizes ordinary citizens to join the fight.",AlexandrTheTolerable,2025-05-08T10:51:45,8

"If you think the outcome of WW2 wasn't a disaster, with the small consolation that the axis was defeated, you are a sheltered little boy who dreams of glory on the battlefield far more than he should.

Tons of unexploded ordinance in farm fields killing kids for decades.   Of course war is a disaster, and the biggest one of all was definitely so.",llamapositif,2025-05-09T08:16:29,0
"The Supreme Court has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of Kilmar Ábrego García, a man who was wrongly deported to El Salvador.
