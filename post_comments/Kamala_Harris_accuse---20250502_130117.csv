Correction. Trump never abandoned it. He never embraced it in the first place.,reddittorbrigade,2025-05-02T13:05:33,115
"I dunno about that.  It’s kinda starting to look like greed, bigotry, and cruelty *are* Americas ideals after all sadly.  And Don embodies them perfectly.",AlphaNewsNetwork,2025-05-02T13:12:43,54
"I, as a non American, was under the impression the highest ideal in America these days is the pursuit of wealth?",Neversetinstone,2025-05-02T13:08:37,16
"Pro tip for democratic politicians: If you want to strike a chord with Trump, don't give policy speeches with detail and nuance. He doesn't understand that. And it's not hyperbole. He literally can not comprehend anything remotely policy related.  I suggest reverting to childish playground insults. That's all he understands: Small hands, Obama was better, change your diaper, gah-gah-goo-goo, etc...  He'll be rage tweeting within 8 minutes. Seriously.",FartyJizzums,2025-05-02T13:35:21,6

"She is forever trapped in the abstract, late to start politispeak, and this is why institutional democrats will continue to lose. He’s not abandoning anything, he doesn’t believe in it. Why speak in a way that grants him allegiance to the idea of American that WE ALL KNOW he has never had? He is loyal to himself and this is not new. When I hear this kind of language, it gives me the same feeling as when the media sane washes him with “allegedly” and “appears to” reporting.",kweenofdelusion,2025-05-02T14:57:00,6
"Blah blah blah.  “American ideals”… “we are better than this”…. “We must come together and find common ground…”  “bipartisan solutions”….  Blah blah blah.  Dems need to step up and play hard ball already.  Call things out strongly and relentlessly.  The old way is gone.  Time to play rough — because the other side will eat your lunch with your high-minded platitudes and empathy.  Yes, those things matter greatly.  But they don’t stop fascism, don’t stop an insane GOP, and they don’t win elections.",RustedRelics,2025-05-02T20:48:37,2

Charles Koch also basically gave a speech with the same message but didn’t mention Trump explicitly. Maybe he shouldn’t have spent decades dumping money into a movement that would obviously and inevitably give us someone like Trump.,KinkyPaddling,2025-05-02T16:19:24,1

"As a Democrat, I am saying that they continue talk in politi-junk speak that everyday Americans can't understand. The word ideals means nothing, and people have no idea how that impacts their life.

The announcement of the obvious state of the government is getting tiresome.   If you want people to take you seriously then come with solutions.   Harris is/was a lawyer. Take an active role in forcing pressure on Trump and his cult of hate. Make them feel the financial and emotional stress like what the populace has done with Musk.   If you can’t take legal action against a sitting president then go after members of his enablers.   Fox is not a news agency so the perpetual liars should be forced to answer for spouting lies and propaganda.   Trump is undermining our country’s political and societal infrastructure. It is time to reciprocate against his infrastructure.,Khorondon01,2025-05-03T08:52:32,2

"Probably because in the deep of all of this politispeak is self centering. Nobody wants to hear “I told you so”, nobody wants to hear “I would have been better” or “I wouldn’t have ‘abandoned America’s highest ideals’”. It is crisis time now, it’s not about any particular individual being self congratulatory about what could have been; the people want to hear what you are going to do about it if you care about this American experiment like we do.",kweenofdelusion,2025-05-02T16:29:11,0
