"Democrats are literally at the weakest they have been in the history of their party, and I’m not exaggerating.  If Republicans hold Senate seats in the 25 states Trump has won in 2016, 2020, and 2024, that is 50 seats in the Senate. I am including North Carolina. Compare that to the 19 states that voted blue in the past 3 elections which is only 38 seats. 6 states swing back and forth.   If this were a party in any other country, leadership would be fired and a new strategy would be developed. But we’re going to continue on this same path because why not?   AOC who has no control over party strategy or any leadership role is somehow to blame by the “moderates” in this party.",Done327,2025-05-05T23:06:16,71

Anyone abstaining essentially voted for trump, but progressive apathy isn't the reason Trump won, nor was it caused by the progressive base or Bernie).

I, someone who is just a regular person, have better political predictive abilities than these fucking yuppies who have fancy degrees in them.   When Trump won the nomination in 2016, I knew we’d lose. I turned to my partner and said, “Trump is gonna win.” Because the DNC, in all their genius, thought they could overnight become marketing gurus capable of battling 30 years of hateful propaganda fed directly into the moronic brains of the average American about Clinton.   It’s pathetic that I knew better than these paid assholes.   When Kamala was pushed forward, I cringed - here we go again (for different reasons), but even my black friends were dubious as shit because we remember the vitriol that came out about her the last time she ran. America is too sexist and too racist in the gerrymandered nonsense we have to ever elect a woman in my lifetime.   I’ve been wrong ONCE politically on who would win or lose a National election and that was Obama. I voted for him confident in my vote but that he’d also lose. I was very shocked he won. And further shocked he wasn’t assassinated on the spot.   Don’t get me wrong, I voted for Hillary knowing she’d lose. But I was beyond confident she’d lose. I pissed off so many of my neo liberal friends explaining to them why but none of them gave me a “you were right” afterwards lol.   The right is correct about hardcore “liberals” living in an echo chamber bubble - my friends who refused the reality of what was coming all lived in blue havens (Seattle, major cities in Cali, Boston).
