"The Judge and his wife hired illegal immigrants to work on their yard, and then let them stay. Probably like all their other wealthy friends do. I don’t think there’s any evidence of gang involvement. Obviously these people trusted them around their family and house.

"For starters, your facts are wrong. The judge rented an apartment to a tenant. Landlords are not required to confirm citizenship status to rent to someone, it's not their job or in their ability.  That said, this judge claims he saw paperwork that was clearly stamped ""This Person Is Not Subject To Removal"" in the top righthand corner, along with the date of their immigration hearing. As far as he knew, they were all good and he was following the law.  EDIT:  Here's some additional reporting on the case. Worth noting that the judge may have admitted to destroying evidence, so that's a strike against my comment that he thought he was following the law. Doesn't change my opinion about the real message behind these two cases.

"I would assume (with limited evidence right now) that they're going to be able to convict this judge on something. The intimidation doesn't work if the target gets off and the charges are easy to dismiss as partisan hackery.   The key part of this story, in my opinion, is the timing in conjunction with the arrest of Judge Dugan in Milwaukee. I think they're also confident in a conviction there, for the same reason, and together they're sending a clear message to the judiciary.",Xullister,2025-04-25T13:30:11,1

If it so happens that they are part of a gang, good on the feds for doing their job and finding them. Remove them from our country.  You say that, but three articles I've read about this have not stated he destroyed a phone with a hammer and drove it to the dump to dispose of it like the commenter said. Including the article linked to the original post. To me, it's nonsense. If this is the truth, though, good. The judge should be investigated and prosecuted properly.
