"Undocumented immigrants should be processed according to the law.  The same as every country in the world.    It's up to the parents how the children are dealt with.  That is also universal, parents decide for their children.  If the parent decides to give custody to an American citizen friend or family, that is the parents decision.  If the parent chooses to abandon their child in America to an orphanage, that is the parents decision.  If the parent chooses to take their child with them, that is the parents decision.    The USA should respect the parents decsion how they want their children's custody to be handled as they are being deported.",SlowFreddy,2025-03-06T20:57:47,9
"Earned path to citizenship for all non citizens. This should include high levels of assimilation into the local community, measured though things like community service hours, letters of reference from community leaders, years/decades of tax statements showing no lapses, strong credit, clean criminal history (obviously beyond the “crime” of illegal presence).",pleetf7,2025-03-06T20:21:17,9

"Anyone born in the united states is and should be and American citizen - revoking birthright citizenship should be a non-starter.  Their parents should be given permanent residency to prevent families from being separated, but granting them full-on citizenship is unfair to those who go through the process fair and square.",SafeThrowaway691,2025-03-07T23:38:21,3
You missed a third option:  c) Deport the parents and let the parents take the child with them  Same as any time a parent has to move for any reason.,bl1y,2025-03-07T09:47:15,6
Send them back with their families and they can come back when they are adults,MurrayBothrard,2025-03-07T08:47:49,2
Work visas. That way both sides benefit. They get to work more easily and the government gets money from their filing fees. Plus local economies would benefit in different ways.,Generalzodd845,2025-03-06T20:43:38,3
A parent of a child who is a citizen should only be deported if they have been convicted of a crime.   Otherwise a path to citizenship.,[deleted],2025-03-06T20:52:09,3
"If an adult commits a crime, they send him to prison even if that separates the adult from the child.  If an adult occupies an apartment for which they made no application nor passed a background check, both the adult and child must leave the apartment.",baxterstate,2025-03-07T08:43:28,2
>the children of illegal immigrants are citizens and therefore cannot be deported constitutionally.  Their deported parents can voluntarily take the children with them.,Inumnient,2025-03-12T09:42:57,1
Kick out the parents let them choose if they want to take their children with them or put them in foster care of with a relative who is a citizen. The children aren't being deposited they can always come back if the parents chose to leave with them,torgoth234,2025-03-13T09:57:23,1
"We’re talking about humanism if you want to be ethical with other humans. So we’d start by calling them undocumented immigrants to be more ethical. Then we’d recognize there are more than the two listed ways you portray this could go. Then we’d realize a utilitarian question of being the most ethical isn’t going to end on ethical lines.   We’d recognize that Republicans as recently as the Biden administration demanded, and later shot down, an immigration reform bill bc they want immigration to stay an issue indefinitely. Republicans dont want to work on this issue in any matter, much less an ethical one when you seriously offer them near anything to get it done. Even before the Biden administration border control and immigration was an issue that was being held in suspense to drum up support for Republicans.   The US should do immigration reform while recognizing the humanity of each immigrant, documented and undocumented. They should treat immigration reform as a humanist exercise rather than a political one. But the US’s political leaders are so far from humanism that the federal minimum wage is still $7.25/hr.",etoneishayeuisky,2025-03-06T21:14:13,1

I think most immigrants come here for their kids to get an education and achieve the American dream. They don’t come here expecting to get rich but just to give their kids a chance at an education and better life. Period. Let them do that.,Single_Job_6358,2025-03-06T21:39:28,0
"Treat them like all the other ""biological american"" families with low income. Make them dependent on low income work and segregate them in ""bad neighborhoods"", let the kids go to the underfunded scools and then blame the immigrants for all the problems the neighborhood could face. This always works well.",Lauchiger-lachs,2025-03-07T07:26:12,-1
Deport the entire family?  That’s what would happen basically in every other country.,BloodDK22,2025-03-08T04:28:51,-1
"Personally, I’m a strong believer that you can’t deport a US citizen. I’m also a strong believer that the US government should deport illegal immigrants irrespective of if they’ve committed any incremental crimes/civil violations (beyond crossing the border/overstaying a visa) or not. So, parents should be deported, noncitizen children should be deported, parents should chose if they want to take their citizen kids with them or not. Parents, IMO, should not be eligible for sponsorship for citizenship in the future. That they are is such a slap in the face to legal immigrants like my parents. It’s also just an incentive for folks to keep coming and having kids in the USA. Reagan screwed up by giving folks amnesty, and that’s just spurred the next generations of illegal immigrants ",Hellsing5000,2025-03-07T00:45:56,-2
"It’s surprising to me that the US government never made an attempt to offer citizenship directly from service in the US military as seamless as getting an honorable discharge with accompanying DD214.  You would think the advantages of getting a wide array of people from abroad who could bring their language skills, knowledge of foreign cultures, and a clear dedication to the country would be no brainers for recruitment.",OrangeBird077,2025-03-06T20:39:37,8
"Wow, they really ""earned"" it by having an anchor baby.   I go to a country like Switzerland, Japan, Norway, etc. and fire out a kid.   Now said country has an obligation to me?   That's insane. I can't even imagine being that entitled.",Ozark--Howler,2025-03-07T18:57:02,3
Why not just kick them out and make it like a class 1 felony with 30 years in jail if you're found in the country again. The parents can then either surrender their kids to the foster care system or take them with them. The children can always come back when they are of age.,torgoth234,2025-04-04T22:11:05,1
Yeah but we also have rules like you have to pay your taxes. Illegal immigrants don't pay taxes so everyone who here legally has to subsidize them. And letting them stay because they have American children just enables the problem.,torgoth234,2025-03-13T09:42:43,1

The parents should be kicked out and the children are allowed to stay or return with them.,torgoth234,2025-03-13T09:43:58,1
No they should be kicked out and never allowed to get citizenship because they were here illegally. And the kids either go with them or put in foster care or left with a relative who is a us citizen.,torgoth234,2025-04-04T22:12:53,1

">That they are is such a slap in the face to legal immigrants like my parents.  What's your opinion of people who do have a legal immigrant status having that revoked because the president is a vindictive cur who prefers undocumented immigrants to legal ones, as they're easier to exploit and hate?",zaoldyeck,2025-03-07T02:24:58,2

"They don't make it automatic because, believe it or not, there are foreign nationals who serve in the US military who do not desire to become US citizens. Sometimes they're just happy with legal residency in the US and want to maintain their original citizenship because it makes it easy to visit their families in their original country, for example.  However, it's pretty -close- to automatic - the paperwork is simple and approval is damn near guaranteed. About the only improvement that we could make is to have the military double-check, just to make sure that someone pokes the few soldiers that haven't already applied for citizenship and lets them know ""hey, you have completed honorable service and earned this, if you want it, let's fill out the form!""",Avatar_exADV,2025-03-07T10:02:01,5
There are standards for recruitment.  Undocumented immigrants are disqualified to join the UD military.  You must be a documented (Legal permenant resident) immigrant to join the US military.   The US military has standards.    There is an expedited path for US citizenship while you are in the US military or have served in the US military.     https://www.uscis.gov/military/naturalization-through-military-service,SlowFreddy,2025-03-06T21:07:37,3

"A lot of those legal statuses, per the name (TPS), were temporary. Your country having a hurricane or a war doesn’t entitle you to a permanent stay in the USA. Beyond that, while there are some legitimate asylum seekers, a lot of them are folks who are not qualified for asylum. Now, no shade to economic immigrants (like most of my relatives) but it’s ridiculous for people who stumble across the border and claim asylum despite not having much of a valid reason to get to stay in the US for years on end. You need to have a skill that is additive to try US economy and not a net drain. My mom who builds and maintains critical infrastructure is probably a bigger net positive than someone who is only able to work at a convenience store and who uses city/state funded housing and meal resources.",Hellsing5000,2025-03-07T10:12:23,-1

My first thought was immigration going back to the 20s/30s and how it would take a politician like McCarthy to try and start retroactively taking away citizenship from Italian American families since they were at one point labeled as WOPs “Without Papers”.,OrangeBird077,2025-03-06T20:55:10,4
"Additionally, if a child is born and raised here by illegal parents they’re most likely only going to speak English and with maybe the exception of family they’ve never met they’re not going to have any kind of support system.  Not to mention should children who weren’t even born yet or taken here without their knowledge/consent have that on their record if they later try and cross legally on their own?

Their parents would be responsible for the language issues in their home country. That is not the US government's problem. I don't see it being a problem to not make the deportation go against the kids record but the parents should absolutely recieve the ban.    Maybe it is harsh but if you reward the action of illegally crossing into the US then you will never get control of the problem. It should have never been allowed to go this long.,Almaegen,2025-03-06T22:45:36,-2
