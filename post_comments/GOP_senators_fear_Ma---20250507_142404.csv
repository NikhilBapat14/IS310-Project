I fully support an MTG run for Senate when this is the likely outcome.,sugarlessdeathbear,2025-05-07T14:37:19,11
"Oh no, you don’t get to do all of the shit you’ve done to build a party built in her and Trump’s image but then cry about her when it no longer benefits you. Nope, you created her, promoted her, put her on important committees. You are her now and she is you.",no_kids-and-3_money,2025-05-07T14:43:07,8

"Don't worry they will cheat with bomb threats in Fulton County, voter roll purges and rule changes right before the election again. Maybe Kemp will forget to secure the registry servers again you know good ole boy politics. When he was SOS he only got caught multiple times with unsecure voting information.  We have this law which allows the local election board to screw with the results. At this point winning and losing is about how many votes you can throw out without getting caught or stopped based on local partisan politics just look at NC. He will accuse everyone of hacking and toss the whole thing?!?! Who knows?

"Not really. In the state as a whole, she's super unpopular. When they asked a group of voters rank potential 2026 candidates (regardless of party) from most to least favorable, she came in dead last.       It's her own little redneck region where she's popular, and even that seems to  be slipping in recent years.",Subliminal_Kiddo,2025-05-07T15:24:04,4
