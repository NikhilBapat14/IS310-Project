"When asked by Stephen A. Smith to explain his administration’s threat to withhold funding from the university, the president started talking about an entirely different location.  ""We had riots in Harlem, in Harlem, and frankly, if you look at what’s gone on, and people from Harlem went up and they protested, Stephen. And they protested very strongly against Harvard.  And then he says that he has tremendous black support. Why this is pertinent to a question about Harvard protests only exists in his mind.",amir_twist_of_fate,2025-05-01T18:01:46,201
