Trumps 2nd term will end up being a top 3 worst presidential term in history,Mahomeboi1595,2025-05-09T17:15:35,8
Seems to be a theme at this point with trump working deals where the other side gains something and America doesn’t.,Beforemath,2025-05-09T17:19:01,5

Every single day Trump is in power he makes it 100% clear why he bankrupted 6 casinos.,JoeMorgan76,2025-05-09T19:01:25,1
"“Under this deal, it will now be cheaper to import a UK vehicle with very little U.S. content than a USMCA compliant vehicle from Mexico or Canada that is half American parts. This hurts American automakers, suppliers, and auto workers,” Blunt said Friday.""  America first baby!",StephenSwolebear,2025-05-10T07:29:21,1
"To be fair, if the whole point was to force US auto manufacturers to inshore everything from Canada and Mexico, then giving a favorable trade deal to the UK doesn't contradict that plan.   >“The U.S. automotive industry is highly integrated with Canada and Mexico; the same is not true for the U.S. and UK,” American Automotive Policy Council President [Matt Blunt ](https://thehill.com/people/matt-blunt/)said in [a statement](https://www.americanautomakers.org/american-automakers-statement-trump-administrations-united-kingdom-trade-announcement).  >“We are disappointed that the administration prioritized the UK ahead of our North American partners,” Blunt added.  If Ford and GM want their companies to be exempted from tariffs applied to Canada and Mexico, then functionally they're just asking for tariffs to only be applied to their competitors without doing anything to give jobs to Americans. I hate Trump even more than the average American but I'm not particularly empathetic to companies like Ford.   When Biden tried to help American car companies by providing an EV tax credit to American EVs, all these fuckers did was raise their prices by exactly the same amount, just to maximize short-term profit while completely negating the whole incentive to buy American cars in the first place. These shitty companies do not deserve anything. Having tariffs stay on foreign cars is only going to give these c\*nts an excuse to raise their own prices because they don't give two shits about the American people",Irr3sponsibl3,2025-05-09T17:57:02,1

"I don't think Ford and GM's interests necessarily coincide with Americans. Relaxing tariffs on British car imports helps British car companies, but they also help the American consumer. If Ford and GM had their way, they would have tariffs lifted from their cars but still keep manufacturing in Canada and Mexico, while tariffs stay on for foreign competitors, which would allow them to raise prices on their own cars for higher profits.",Irr3sponsibl3,2025-05-09T18:04:46,-2
