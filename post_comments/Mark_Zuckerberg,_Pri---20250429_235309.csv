"My guess as an actual high school teacher who‚Äôs been doing this for over a decade myself.  The data showed through reading and math scores that the intervention failed. Systemic poverty is a multi-generational problem and no pet project, even with the best intentions, is going to fix that.  The same forces that allow Mark to spend millions to fight for property rights to make a section of a Hawaiian beach *only for him* are the same forces that doomed this venture.  Poverty is poverty.",Weekly_Rock_5440,2025-04-30T03:52:34,43

"To be fair, California spends 125 billion every year on k-12 education alone (85bn in state funds, another 40 in federal funds they direct). A one-off contribution of Zuckerberg's entire notional net worth of 185bn would barely be a drop in the ocean of tackling systemic poverty in the us, let alone the poor parts of the world.  And that's under the daydream that He actually ""has"" 185bn. In reality, most of that money is imaginary, and subject to extreme fluctuation (he's ""lost"" about 50bn in the last two months). Since his wealth is mostly just ownership of Facebook stock, anything that caused a crash in the price of that stock - like it's founder and largest shareholder cashing out - would immediately eradicate much of that ""wealth"" (though how much is unknown).  He can and should do more through this sort of targeted intervention in pilot schemes and the like, which the government is too risk-averse to invest in. But to get real money, you'd need to have some sort of system whereby the entire class of wealthy Americans systematically contributed to some sort of collective fund operated by the state, or a body working closely in concert with the state. Better yet, though, would be some form of contribution made directly by the corporations that give people like.zuckerberg his wealth in the first place.",VacuousWastrel,2025-04-30T05:25:01,8
