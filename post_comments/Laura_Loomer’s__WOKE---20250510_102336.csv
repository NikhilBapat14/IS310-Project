"Ah, but she wouldn’t stumble on the answer. Instead she’d do one or both of the following things while NOT answering. She’d frame the idea that the Pope is a Marxist as one that “everyone knows” about while pointing out vaguely that “others are saying it, and YOU must have heard them say it!” Then, without leaving time for a follow-up like “Who specifically is saying it?” She’d make it clear that NOT knowing that everyone thinks that the Pope is a Marxist means that YOU’RE the idiot. Then she might verbally attack the person asking the question as if asking the question is an assault that proves that the asker is actually in cahoots with the woke Marxist cabal and can’t be trusted.   This is where journalists with integrity would either not report what she said because it’s obvious bullshit that is worth absolutely nothing, or report that she’s a lunatic that is divorced from reality and fact. Instead we just get a record of what she says presented as legitimate news about “the other side” in pursuit of this false notion of balance.   And that’s one of the reasons we’re all going to die. ",johhnny5,2025-05-10T10:45:38,1

"The [Vatican](https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/the-journal/the-financial-mess-facing-the-vatican/9923c7d3-a1eb-4dc6-94ad-9047f5e3ca75) is actually broke and deeply in debt. They are asset rich and cash poor. They can’t actually sell the priceless cultural heritage they are custodians of and they also need the stuff to generate tourism revenue. Without all that cultural heritage they are nothing and a core reason for their existence is to act a living museum for all that stuff. They don’t actually get any of the collection plate money given to local churches, that money stays with local dioceses. Money doesn’t flow from the bottom directly to the top. Money is siloed into thousands of different pockets.   That’s one of Pope Francis’ biggest concerns in last days and one of the biggest challenges for the new pope to tackle. The Vatican is basically just living off museum tickets proceeds at this point which is why they are going into debt paying for embassies, pensions for clergy and Swiss guards as well as operating the Caritas global charity (the second biggest humanitarian aid network after the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement). The Vatican Bank was founded to draw in investor for the Holy See but that turned into a corrupt mafia-ridden mess, hence the plot of The Godfather III.  The papacy and papal politics has a lot more to do with accounting than you might think. Benedict XVI resigned in no small part because of financial troubles. Francis’ biggest reform of reign was to make Vatican accounting more transparent and rational as much as any theological reforms. Just like anything else, to really understand what’s going on you have to also follow the money. The church has been in some kind of financial quagmire for centuries but had been on the verge of a default ever since they lost the Papal States. Vatican City is weird, they are a sovereign country but with zero resources except for history and tradition.  The Catholic Church actually does do a lot of charity work. Catholic social teaching does directly criticize the ideology of capitalism and the Church actually has a history of supporting labor unions and workers’ protections. They have their own economic ideology called distributism which is positioned as being the middle ground between capitalism and socialism that’s calls for wealth to be evenly distributed across society. The Catholic Church is interesting because if you focus on their doctrine, they are more focused on economic equality and social justice than the vast majority of Protestant churches.

And as with banning members from trading stocks and other “getting money out of politics” ideas, the vast majority won’t move anything forward that goes against their own personal best interests.

The only way this could actually happen is for the 28% of Americans who are religious “Nones” (atheists, religiously unaffiliated, etc.) to treat it as a single issue, and even then we’d probably need to get closer to 50% for it to actually matter. You can count on everyone else to claim that “my church isn’t like that” if the issue is brought up.
