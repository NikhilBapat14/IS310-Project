"The [Vatican](https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/the-journal/the-financial-mess-facing-the-vatican/9923c7d3-a1eb-4dc6-94ad-9047f5e3ca75) is actually broke and deeply in debt. They are asset rich and cash poor. They can‚Äôt actually sell the priceless cultural heritage they are custodians of and they also need the stuff to generate tourism revenue. Without all that cultural heritage they are nothing and a core reason for their existence is to act a living museum for all that stuff. They don‚Äôt actually get any of the collection plate money given to local churches, that money stays with local dioceses. Money doesn‚Äôt flow from the bottom directly to the top. Money is siloed into thousands of different pockets.   That‚Äôs one of Pope Francis‚Äô biggest concerns in last days and one of the biggest challenges for the new pope to tackle. The Vatican is basically just living off museum tickets proceeds at this point which is why they are going into debt paying for embassies, pensions for clergy and Swiss guards as well as operating the Caritas global charity (the second biggest humanitarian aid network after the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement). The Vatican Bank was founded to draw in investor for the Holy See but that turned into a corrupt mafia-ridden mess, hence the plot of The Godfather III.  The papacy and papal politics has a lot more to do with accounting than you might think. Benedict XVI resigned in no small part because of financial troubles. Francis‚Äô biggest reform of reign was to make Vatican accounting more transparent and rational as much as any theological reforms. Just like anything else, to really understand what‚Äôs going on you have to also follow the money. The church has been in some kind of financial quagmire for centuries but had been on the verge of a default ever since they lost the Papal States. Vatican City is weird, they are a sovereign country but with zero resources except for history and tradition.  The Catholic Church actually does do a lot of charity work. Catholic social teaching does directly criticize the ideology of capitalism and the Church actually has a history of supporting labor unions and workers‚Äô protections. They have their own economic ideology called distributism which is positioned as being the middle ground between capitalism and socialism that‚Äôs calls for wealth to be evenly distributed across society. The Catholic Church is interesting because if you focus on their doctrine, they are more focused on economic equality and social justice than the vast majority of Protestant churches.
