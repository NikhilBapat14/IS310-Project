Soon everything that is not missionary sex between people of the opposite sex will be allowed. Anything else will send you to a re-education camp for 10 years.  Welcome to the new christo-nazi states of America!,NorthenFreeman,2025-05-01T12:51:03,15
The amount of gender-affirming surgery Trump and his cabinet has had is beyond all reckoning. I guess they don't want to compete with trans people for slots.,Just_the_nicest_guy,2025-05-01T12:49:36,12
"It's basically the Cass Report, as it was cited 149 times in this 400-page ""report"" and there are not even any names attached as authors. That report was proven debunked, proven to use bad and incomplete methodology, and widely criticized by organizations and associations of experts that study and know more about that than the people who wrote it.  This one recommends conversion therapy, deadnames people left and right while telling incomplete stories, suggests it's a social thing with zero evidence, and more....and that's just from a couple of little summaries I've seen of people pouring over this. There's no real basis for this, the transphobia is dripping from every page, and it's obvious this will be their first step in eliminating all trans people from public life (or worse).   (EDIT: The report at one point says ""youth with GD up to age 26 years"" so they are absolutely targeting adults with this.)  trans allies need to step the fuck up now. Time to put action to your words: protest, write to your congress people, fight to get this thrown out as the anti-trans garbage it is, and protect trans people. There's been far too much speaking and not enough action for too long. The time is now here to prove if your allyship is performative or not: if you care, fight.  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  EDIT 1: The report at one point says ""youth with GD up to age 26 years"" so they are absolutely targeting adults with this. They also don't name names, there are nameless reviewers cited.  Conflate social transition as a medical thing.....but that's mostly just a change of name and haircut, so like wtf?? There's also contradictory things throughout, which shouldn't shock anyone. This has only been out 3 hours or so and it's already so full of holes that swiss cheese is jealous. This needs to be challenged in court immediately, and experts need to be utilized to point out how insane this transphobic misinformation is.  EDIT 2: Names have been discovered, using the metadata. Alex Byrne, John Koenig, & Blake Sanchez.  [Source](https://bsky.app/profile/floralashes.bsky.social/post/3lo4yaraw6c2u).",ThatKehdRiley,2025-05-01T12:55:44,15
"Heres the thing: no matter how poorly or well constructed it is, it is always going to be wrong.  They know that, same as us.  This was never meant to be more than a large 'casus belli' to justify increasing systemic discriminatory transphobia and further genocide.  Valid objections didn't stop the Cass Report, and it won't stop this or Trump.     Which isn't to say stop going through it or pointing out the massive flaws, but to ensure we keep in mind the only way things get better is removing conservatives from the levers of power.",SomeComforts,2025-05-01T13:55:53,4
"400 pages of lies, citing the likes of the NYT and Cass, to lay the groundwork to justify banning trans healthcare for youth first (that they define as individuals under 26!) and then certainly for all other adults. Any news org that gives this report credence (especially in headlines, looking at you Axios, PBS) is complicit in the eradication of trans people in the US. This will only harm us. If you're cis you need to speak out against this at every opportunity or you too are complicit.",witchgrove,2025-05-01T13:20:57,5
