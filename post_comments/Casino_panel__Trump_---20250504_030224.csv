Guy with a history of bankrupted casinos might do it again?   Shocking,Crazy-Nights,2025-05-04T03:07:20,1
"I often wonder how much more quickly gambling can expand.  When Ohio introduced sports betting, about a third of households signed up for sports betting accounts BEFORE it was legal. App-based gambling is the easiest to expand because the apps already exist. It's just a question of licensing bookmakers.",No_Philosopher_1870,2025-05-04T03:35:12,1
So Casino gambling or traditional destination gambling is probably going to be hurt significantly with likely casino closers or bankruptcies even. Americans have less disposable wealth and are having a hard time thus justifying spending on a trip to Vegas. With the international aspect as well as lot of conferences were held in Vegas they likely are getting moved ergo less casino revenue. This is compounded by general efforts to legalize online gambling and sports betting (as why go to a casino if one can gamble on one's phone) which also take away from casinos and destination casinos. Generally in poor economic times gambling does go up but at more local casinos and the online or smaller scale gambling (not saying sports betting isn't an epidemic smaller scale meaning less money per bet). Ergo gambling can expand but likely at the expense of destination casinos (Vegas) and the increasing rise of online gambling sites and gambling addiction which has been seen (lot easier to gamble away the family home on one's phone than having to fly to Vegas or even drive to the nearest casino).  Texas and California are the main markets to look out for as they have so far resisted measures aimed at allowing sports betting but if they go a large portion of the US population has access to online gambling (and California especially would take large amounts of visitors then away from Vegas).,cjh42,2025-05-04T07:39:43,2
