"I assume this is for an artifact, like a copy of the Aitkens bible or just acknowledging that the Aitkens bible exists?   I had no idea and so I just looked it up. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Aitken_(publisher)  >Robert Aitken printed 10,000 copies of his Bible in 1781. Only 30-40 copies are believed to still exist today. The Aitken Bible was the first complete English Bible printed in America.

">H.Res.365 - Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the House should recognize Robert Aitken's Bible as a historical document of the United States Congress  While the claim that this Bible is ‚Äúthe most literal translation‚Äù is debatable, it‚Äôs still a religious text‚Äî**not** a historical document of Congress or any U.S. government body by any honest standard. The Russian-aligned GOP can pass a thousand resolutions trying to enshrine it, but it won‚Äôt ever make it historical fact.  What‚Äôs worse is the hypocrisy: these supremely Pharisaical Republicans aren‚Äôt content with forcing their theology into government like American Ayatollahs‚Äîthey also ignore the very teachings of Christ they claim to follow. **Jesus said, ‚ÄúWhatever you did for the least of these‚Äîthe poor, the sick, the hungry, the stranger‚Äîyou did for me‚Äù (Matthew 25:40).** Yet their policies‚Äîslashing aid to the poor, defunding HIV programs that save lives (PEPFAR), planning mass deportations, etc., ‚Äî consistently do the opposite.  If Republicans had even a shred of respect for the Constitution, as they so loudly pretend to, they‚Äôd remember the First Amendment and stop trying to breach the wall between church and state. As Jefferson himself wrote:  *‚ÄúThe day will come when the mystical generation of Jesus‚Ä¶ will be classed with the fable of the generation of Minerva in the brain of Jupiter.‚Äù* ‚ÄîThomas Jefferson to John Adams, 1814.",haiku2572,2025-05-01T11:39:53,5

"It seems silly to me that this somehow falls under the purview of Congress, and not some heritage foundation or national museum.  But the first English language bible printed in the newly established United States is something of historic significance, the same way the Gutenberg bible, or Wycliffe bible are.   At least, it is of historic significance to the US.",2much2Jung,2025-05-01T10:59:46,3

"I mainly teach Hebrew Bible (along with primarily working on Late Bronze Age Ugaritic, Akkadian, and Sumerian texts). The only translation I let my students use is the Jewish Publication Society one. For NT, things get a little dicey.",lionofyhwh,2025-05-01T10:59:43,3
"The Jewish Publication Society one is great for the a Hebrew Bible/Old Testament. If forced to pick a NT version, I‚Äôd lean toward the Jewish Annotated New Testament. It‚Äôs not a new translation, but the accompanying essays and commentary place that translation in its 1st c. Jewish context. What I‚Äôd really recommend is reading something like Hays‚Äô Hidden Riches alongside a Bible, so you are getting its broader ancient Near Eastern context.",lionofyhwh,2025-05-01T11:15:18,2
