"What an asshat. He tries to be tRump but yet fails. He doesn't answer a question about illegally deporting US Citizens that happen to be children. Does he not understand that what they did was completely illegal... He just ignores it........... Again, what an asshat....................",Harry_Mud,2025-04-29T15:25:58,4

Dude for real. Idk how anyone listens to any of them seriously.  It’s like being in highschool and that one idiot in your class is on one and thinks what he is saying is insightful when really all he is doing is holding us over the bell and making us late to leave school. Like who honestly likes that type of guy.,AcidRohnin,2025-04-29T16:34:28,3
