"No. It doesn‚Äôt if you actually read the document. She sent the guy out the door to where agents were waiting. They didn‚Äôt arrest him. One of the agents rode the fucking elevator down with him.    So, no, it‚Äôs not exactly as described.   edit: can't reply to the comment but they had numerous chances to arrest him not including the elevator and chose not to. Agents were waiting for him in the public hallway. No amount of goal post moving will change any of this.    >After leaving the Chief Judge‚Äôs vestibule and returning to the **public hallway**, DEA Agent A reported that Flores-Ruiz and his attorney were in the **public hallway**. DEA Agent B also observed Flores-Ruiz and his attorney in the hallway near Courtroom 615 and noted that Flores- Ruiz was looking around the hallway. From different vantage points, both agents observed Flores-Ruiz and his counsel walk briskly towards the elevator bank on the south end of the sixth floor. I am familiar with the layout of the sixth floor of the courthouse and know that the south elevators are not the closest elevators to Courtroom 615, and therefore it appears that Flores-Ruiz and his counsel elected not to use the closest elevator bank to Courtroom 615. DEA Agent A followed Flores-Ruiz and his attorney towards the south elevator bank. At approximately 8:50 a.m., DEA Agent A alerted other members of the arrest team that DEA Agent A was on the elevator with Flores-Ruiz. While on the elevator, Flores-Ruiz and his attorney spoke to each other in Spanish, which DEA Agent A did not understand.

"The charging document is very clear, and your summaries misrepresent what it says.   There are corroborating statements from multiple attorneys present in the courtroom, the court officer, victim advocate, and others all saying that immediately upon returning to the courtroom (after sending agents to to chief judge‚Äôs office), she directed the defendant and his attorney to exit from the rear jury door into a non-public hallway. That hallway snakes through a non-public space to a part of the public corridor where federal agents wouldn‚Äôt expect him to emerge and near a more distant elevator bank.   They can‚Äôt effectuate an arrest on an administrative warrant in a non-public area, so the elevator wasn‚Äôt an option. When he exited into the public parking lot, they attempted to an arrest and he fled.  It‚Äôs far more straightforward than you‚Äôre suggesting.   If she wasn‚Äôt facilitating his evasion, he would have had his pre-trial hearing (which never happened) and then exited through the court door like everyone else who isn‚Äôt a judge, juror, court reporter, court officer, or defendant in custody.

"The interesting part:  the due process to determine the label of your choosing, woman beater, applies to this individual and the appropriate legal consequences applied, **was interrupted by ICE**.  The county judge wants local women to feel comfortable bringing charges against deserving offenders, and let the courts mete out the consequences. The incursion by ICE at the courthouse short-circuits that, creates fearful families, and denies victims their protections under the law, and potentially ruptures support for American citizen children domestically. The judge is operating in the interests of the sanctity of the cases before her, not ICE and their lack of judicial warrant.",localistand,2025-04-29T18:45:47,17

"That‚Äôs fine. So we don‚Äôt have to call him a woman beater.   That aside: are you willing to contest anything else I‚Äôve said? Because it directly contradicts everything you said. The secret hallway doesn‚Äôt lead to the public area where ICE was waiting. It leads to a ‚Äúnonpublic area‚Äù per the complaint. In essence she told the officers they had to arrest him in a public area, not the courtroom, as they have in the past. They agreed. Then she snuck him into a nonpublic area to escape.

"The courthouse is for court cases, regardless of hallways, secret or otherwise. Absent the judicial warrant, ICE had no business in any non-public areas of the courthouse. The judges and courthouse personnel can use their own jurisdiction courthouse layout as needed, in the interests of completing their duties.   ICE laziness of not apprehending their target in the parking lot (where they did anyway) and wanting to pop a squat on a bench inside the courthouse foyer instead is not grounds for arresting the judge for using the hallways of the courthouse in the interest of completing the cases assigned to them.",localistand,2025-04-29T18:59:23,11
"I did. It‚Äôs quite literally the exact opposite of that. Door leads to public area where these specific agents were waiting. Didn‚Äôt arrest him. Then one rode the elevator down with him.

"Well a judge will decide if you‚Äôre right. But the fact that there‚Äôs no other reason for a defendant and their counsel to be lead through a secret hallway that leads to a nonpublic area is a major reason another judge signed off on an arrest warrant after viewing this complaint.

"Right. So they were lead to a nonpublic hallway that eventually feeds into a completely different public hallway. By redirecting Flores-Ruiz to a private area, she committed obstruction. No other person would be lead that way. And there‚Äôs no other reason to lead him that way except to help him evade arrest. Because he was lead to that private area, the arrest had to take place outside in public and after a foot chase.   Regardless, this comes down to the judges intent while leading them down that private hallway. She told the officers they could make the arrest once he was done with court and in the public area. But she then lead him to a different area using her privilege as a judge.
