The thread pinned on top of this sub with various news media had questions asking about the sane washing and lack of push back and none of them could give a strong answer. The media fails us by treating Donald Trump with an entirely different level of rules and expectations.,Orange8920,2025-04-29T21:56:16,5
"In his first term he decided to no longer grant any interviews or even answer any questions from any media outlet he didn't want to.   Prior to that a president could expect to be given confrontational questions from media outlets with a variety of slants, and he would have to defend himself on the spot.   Trump completely cancelled that. No interviews unless he feels like it. And no statements back to the media unless he feels like it.",NinjaLanternShark,2025-04-29T21:15:34,3

"My idea, which I have no idea how to actually set up, or get to critical mass, would be to establish a crowd-funded bounty system for members of the WH press pool. Asking a question that's too hard, or even loaded, could easily get them removed, and possibly fired by their employer, but I think, on a national scale, if it were broadcast, such a question could be quite valuable. Hopefully it could be valuable enough to account for the damage a journalist would be doing to their career. People could deposit money towards a submitted question, with the option to withdraw it(because the most relevant questions would constantly be in flux based on world events) until its claimed. Questions with the biggest money pools would rise to the top. When the question was broadcast, the bounty could be claimed.",xnihil0zer0,2025-04-30T00:02:39,1
