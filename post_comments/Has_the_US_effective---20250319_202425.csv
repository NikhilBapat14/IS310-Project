"Yes, and one important dimension to the coup is Russia's successful use of hybrid warfare to support US quislings, Assets, and traitors, most obviously Trump himself.  1 - Here is an FBI affidavit describing the extreme lengths that Russia went to to install Donald in the White House.

They would not have gone to such lengths without expecting a massive return on investment.  See also the Mueller Report and the Senate Intelligence Committee reports on Russian interference in the 2016 election.  2 - Right after the 2024 election Putin's friend reminded Donald of all the favors he owes them, broadcasted to the whole world:  [https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/donald-trump-has-obligations-to-those-who-brought-him-to-power-putin-ally/ar-AA1tX1h3](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/donald-trump-has-obligations-to-those-who-brought-him-to-power-putin-ally/ar-AA1tX1h3)  3 - Ever since then he's been giving them everything they could ever want, and more.

"One could call it a coup. Its not the direct image of a coup tho. Ive not seen tanks rolling through the street, we didn't see skirmishes between the National Guard and Federal military branches, and Biden wasn't overthrown. He tried it at Jan 6 but failed.   However what's happening over there is total state capture. That's for sure.  Jacob Zuma is proud, he thought his boy Elon well.   ""State capture occurs when powerful individuals, companies, or groups manipulate government institutions and laws to serve their own interests. Unlike typical corruption, which influences the enforcement of existing laws, state capture shapes the creation of laws and policies to benefit certain actors. This influence can extend to the executive, legislature, judiciary, and electoral processes, often through private lobbying or covert corruption. It is not always illegal, as the captured state itself may determine its legality. The concept has been widely studied, including in South Africa, where it was linked to constitutional violations and grand corruption undermining democracy.""",Designer-Agent7883,2025-03-20T03:20:01,35

Is it really a coup if you were invited in and appointed by the president to perform a specific task under his permission and direction? It's not like Elon just randomly walked into the government and said I'm doing this that and the other. When Trump was running he made it clear this was part of his agenda and people voted for it. I think it would be like saying that judges who people never voted for who are blocking actions by the administration is a coup.,Ham-N-Burg,2025-03-20T10:53:00,23

"Only if concept of a coup d'état has lost all meaning.  So no.  Things can be very bad, and still not be a coup. A President can do many illegal, unprecedented things, without it being a coup. A President could even transform into an actual dictator without it being a coup. A coup is a very specific thing.  The closest we've come to having one in the US in recent history (and perhaps all of US history) is January 6th, which could easily be framed as an attempted coup. Albeit an incredibly disorganized one with no backing from the military. But the mob got their way on January 6th, that would have, in fact, been a coup right here in the US.

"Not a traditional coup, but what’s happening with Musk and DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) sure as hell looks like a hostile takeover of the federal government’s operations by an unelected billionaire.  We’ve got: -Mass firings of government workers without due process. -Dismantling entire agencies (like USAID) without legal authority, to the point where a federal judge had to step in. - Refusal to release records on decisions affecting thousands of employees and federal contracts. - Contradictions from Trump’s team, saying Musk is just an advisor while simultaneously calling him the head of DOGE.  And the wildest part? Some of Musk’s people literally occupied government buildings, locking out elected officials while they took control of systems and data. That’s not just “efficiency reforms”—it’s some Silicon Valley cyberpunk coup-lite sh*t happening in real time.  Legally speaking, it’s still being challenged, and courts are stepping in, but the fact that we’re even debating whether the world’s richest man just took over parts of the U.S. government is a pretty strong sign that something isn’t right.",already-redacted,2025-03-20T16:20:42,2

"What Putin wanted most was a defenseless Ukraine like Obama delivered in 2014 when Russia just rolled over Ukraine to take over Crimea.  Even after that Obama stuck with his absurd nonlethal aid policy for another two years despite it being a proven failure after the invasion. Trump hurt Russia more than any other President in the 21st century by reversing that policy to give Ukraine over 3 years stockpiling and training with modern defensive weaponry.   https://thehill.com/policy/international/365906-trump-administration-approves-lethal-arms-sales-to-ukraine/  Ukraine used that to great effect holding Russia at bay. With just a few more years of that they could have repelled an invasion or even deter one completely by being so well prepared. Trump didn’t stop there either he as hit Russia with sanctions that hurt:  >The sanctions target firms building Nord Stream 2, an undersea pipeline that will allow Russia to increase gas exports to Germany. The US considers the project a security risk to Europe.  https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50875935  Yet Biden lifted those sanctions and the ones targeting Putin’s allies:  >The Biden administration has waived sanctions on a company building a controversial gas pipeline between Russia and Germany. The US also lifted sanctions on the executive - an ally of Russia's Vladimir Putin - who leads the firm behind the Nord Stream 2 project.  https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57180674  Why would an “obvious Russia Asset” hit Russia where it hurts and give Ukraine the means to shred Russia’s tanks with javelins when they tried to blitz through like they did in 2014?  All he had to do was nothing as Obama had already given Putin what he wanted, but Trump reversed that in his first year in office.    We didn’t need to wait for the Mueller Report either to know there was no direct evidence of Russia collusion to elect Trump as our intelligence agencies were telling us that in 2017 under oath.  Here is former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testimony on the evidence seen for collusion, coordination, or conspiracy: (page 26)  >MR. CLAPPER: Well, no, it’s not. **I never saw any direct empirical evidence that the Trump campaign or someone in it was plotting/conspiring with the Russians** to meddle with the election. That's not to say that there weren't concerns about the evidence we were seeing, **anecdotal evidence**, REDACTED, REDACTED. But I do not recall any instance when I had direct evidence of the content of these meetings. It's just the frequency and prevalence of them was of concern.  https://web.archive.org/web/20250201050410/https://www.dni.gov/files/HPSCI_Transcripts/2020-05-04-James_Clapper-MTR_Redacted.pdf  We also knew then what Russia’s true intent was in interfering with the election from the same testimony: (page 24)  >MR. CLAPPER: Well, I can't envision them (Russia) falling off on something that for them was very successful with very minimal resources. So I would expect them to be even -- to be emboldened, as I've said publicly before, and more aggressive about influencing elections. And I don't think they're going to care too much **whether it's Democrats or Republicans. Their principal objective remains consistently undermining the faith, trust, and confidence of the American public of the electorate in our system**, and I think they'll continue to do that.  Yet instead of resisting that Democrats perpetuated a lie and did Russia’s bidding merely because it was politically expedient to delegitimize the presidency of the political opposition. Still doing Putin’s bidding even today.  It’s a coup now, is it?  Ok comrade, let’s erode the public’s faith in our system of governance even further because the possibility of getting spending back to preCOVID levels is somehow the end of democracy as we know it.  Just the littlest push from Putin and Democrats would rather hand the world over to him than to share power with Republicans.

For anyone wondering why I’m calling him that - Vance has been funded from jump by Curtis Yarvin and Peter Thiel and their “Cathedral.” He is their long term plan for their fascist technocracy, with their proposed company towns: “For over a decade, Yarvin, an ex-computer programmer-turned-blogger, has argued that American democracy is irrevocably broken and ought to be replaced with a monarchy styled after a Silicon Valley tech start-up. According to Yarvin, the time has come to jettison existing democratic institutions and concentrate political power in a single “chief executive” or “dictator.” These ideas — which Yarvin calls “neo-reaction” or “the Dark Enlightenment” — were once confined to the fringes of the internet, but now, with Trump’s reelection, they are finding a newly powerful audience in Washington.” (1)   This fucker is the scariest of them all and this is the game plan since they started funding Vance for senate in 2022.

Disregarding quotes directly from some of the people that wrote the Bill of Rights is just historical revisionism and a trick often used by authoritarians.

They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes.... Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man."" - Thomas Jefferson, Commonplace Book (quoting 18th century criminologist Cesare Beccaria), 1774-1776  ""To disarm the people...[i]s the most effectual way to enslave them."" - George Mason, referencing advice given to the British Parliament by Pennsylvania governor Sir William Keith, The Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adooption of the Federal Constitution, June 14, 1788  ""I ask who are the militia? They consist now of the whole people, except a few public officers."" - George Mason, Address to the Virginia Ratifying Convention, June 4, 1788  ""Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed, as they are in almost every country in Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops."" - Noah Webster, An Examination of the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution, October 10, 1787  ""Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation, the existence of subordinate governments, to which the people are attached, and by which the militia officers are appointed, forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of."" - James Madison, Federalist No. 46, January 29, 1788  ""The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.

"> The FTC is not quasi legislative/judicial, but is an independent agency under the executive branch.   A unanimous SCOTUS said otherwise.

The commission is to be nonpartisan, and it must, from the very nature of its duties, act with entire impartiality. It is charged with the enforcement of no policy except the policy of the law. Its duties are neither political nor executive, but predominantly quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative.  .  > This was actually something Trump had campaigned on, that proxy appointees had the power to draft laws and policy without executive oversight.   Yes, that's what made it quasi-legislative/judicial according to the Supreme Court.  > The White House page explicitly outlays the issue with this standard of governance, in that divisions of the executive branch are empowered to do as they see fit, but are beholden to absolutely no one except the power which placed them, which may-well be defunct in one-election's time.  That's fine to think that. But SCOTUS has already ruled otherwise. If they want to change it, they need to use their Congressional majorities to change the law (they can do this at any time for the next 2 years). If they want to ban the possibility of such an agency in perpetuity, they need to amend the Constitution to make that clear.  > but are beholden to absolutely no one except the power which placed them, which may-well be defunct in one-election's time.

I don't know what difference you think it'd make from a practical standpoint to have it be a ""legislative agency"" instead. The effect is the same. It was created to be independent. Congress could impeach them if they wished, or dismantle the entire agency (effectively firing them), or place them under the control of the executive. Congress runs the show here.

You types seem to collectively forget that the government and military are made up of the people as well. If it came down to a civil war in the modern age it would not be nearly as straightforward as you're making it seem. In fact known combat journalist Robert Evans has a pretty good podcast series that started out on a hypothetical civil war in the US based on experiences that he has had in other countries. It would likely devolve into severe guerrilla warfare, and could even possibly split the country up on a state to state basis. The biggest wild card are the veterans, so many military veterans are disillusioned and they are battle-hardened from fighting against guerrilla warfare tactics in Afghanistan and Iraq other countries in the Middle East, these people know what works and what doesn't. One of the biggest threats that they could cause is hypothetically if some psychotic group like the oath keepers decided to blow up the water pipelines going from the Hoover dam to California they would seriously affect produce in this country causing even more unrest.  The war would not be a simple US versus the government, there would likely be a lot of defectors from within the government and the military and it would cause a lot of splinter groups to spring up. A lot of these groups would have the military training and they would take equipment with them as they abandoned their military posts and switched sides. The whole situation would be incredibly bloody.   Ask for nuclear weapons that doesn't even need to be a part of the conversation because I highly doubt any Americans even in a civil war would use those against each other. What is more likely it is if the country split into multiple factions of the weapons would also get split up and divided amongst those factions.

"> I think you are capable of looking up that Doge used DC police to force themselves into a building they didn’t belong, then vandalized the structure and tortured the workers there.  That’s not what I find. I find the Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, gave orders for the agency to allow DOGE in for an audit. When they failed to comply, they rightfully used the police to evict the insubordinate staff as trespassers.  https://www.npr.org/2025/03/18/nx-s1-5331354/doge-staff-enter-the-u-s-institute-of-peace-d-c-police-help  > You dropped a lame duck substack that showed nothing. Show me where Congress voted on Doge. Also, Obama never made Doge. There was no Doge organization during Obama’s time in office. Doge has only existed since 2025.  I literally gave you the article of NPR and quoted it saying it was an organization made by Obama and renamed by Trump.

"> That’s not what I find. I find the Secretary of State, Marco Rubio  Rubio isn't even mentioned in that article. Nor does Rubio have that sort of authority. Also, audits are done by accountants. Not hackers. This was an unlawful entry executed by the Doge internal coup operation.   >I literally gave you the article of NPR and quoted it saying it was an organization made by Obama and renamed by Trump. What more evidence do you need?  In that article…  >DOGE, was created by Trump   but also…  >Trump didn't create a new Cabinet-level department with DOGE  Sounds like rubbish. Because both cannot be true.  Reality is the first one is correct. trump created Doge an illegitimate non-sanctioned internal coup operation. Whatever trump does first is the most accurate, then when he lamely attempts to cover his tracks. His most recent track covering is claiming he didn't sign the Alien Enemies Act when he clearly did. But, fact is, that's exactly how every autocrat behaves.  So much of what trump does can only be believed if one suspends reality and logic. Which is what his cult following does.  >So in other words you offer no real evidence to support your position and you stick your fingers in your ears when I offer concrete evidence that counters what you’re saying?  What do I have to prove to you? You support autocracy and the total destruction of democracy.

"The Secretary of State is the head of administration for all of these agencies. They all report through him to the president and has the second to last say on who stays and who goes, outside of congressional appointments.   It’s not rubbish, you’re playing mental gymnastics to get over the simple fact that DOGE is just a renaming of the USDS - I’ve said that repeatedely.    Yea I’m done. You believe what you like. You don’t like evidence to the contrary and keep insisting “it’s’ out there if I just google” but you can’t even form a cogent argument based on this non existent evidence.

"> It’s not rubbish, you’re playing mental gymnastics to get over the simple fact that DOGE is just a renaming of the USDS   Ah, sure… first came Doge then came the renaming because Doge was so obviously illegal. Can't have people realizing it's a coup in the first 24 hours of one's inauguration. Must keep the masses calm as long as possible before turning on them.  >You don’t like evidence to the contrary and keep insisting “it’s’ out there if I just google”   No. I said that you are too far down the rabbit hole of supporting autocracy for evidence to matter to you. That any evidence I link you won't believe. There's just no reason for me to bother taking the time when I already know the outcome.  > When people in the center of the aisle see you they easily come and break bread with me.
