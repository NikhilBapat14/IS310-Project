"Most news says it's the lowest in 80 years, since the polling began. And being worse than every other president recorded (especially Biden and Obama) is the only recent criticism Trump will really care about. News--everywhere--that Trump's polls are historically LOW is great news indeed at 100 days. He will be VERY upset. :-)  (The only bad result is that the only issue he's above 50% approval on is gender identity. This will mean more attacks will be coming on trans people.)",FIlm2024,2025-04-27T11:29:08,1

"Fuck Trump but this is an inherently political operation. They care very deeply about how their actions are perceived by their base, as do Congressional Republicans.
