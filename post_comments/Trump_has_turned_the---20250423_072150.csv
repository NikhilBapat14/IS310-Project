"This is hilarious because it makes the first Trump administrations handling of covid look even worse. They were out there telling everyone that a literal lab-engineered bioweapon was no big deal and just continue life as normal.   Then pushing an anti-vax narrative because the vaccine is ""made in a lab"". They could have just as easily pushed a narrative that the lab-made vaccine is a weapon of freedom in the biological war started by China and its your patriotic duty to get the most effective weapon, a lab-made vaccine, to fight a lab-made virus to keep America great.",Weekly-Locksmith6812,2025-04-23T07:39:41,222

"Most human viruses have crossed over from animal populations. Ebola, rabies, all the coronaviruses, swine flu, bird flu, bubonic plague (Black Death).   What the MAGAt's have constructed is a 'not-my-fault' scenario for Idiot Trump. Conspiracy theorists came up with 'lab in Wuhan.'  A lab in Wuhan? Wuhan is a megacity with a population over 18 million! This is bigger than most states in America! Of course you'll find laboratories there, just like you'll find laboratories in states a fraction of the size.   The moron in the White House created a fractious uncooperative exchange with China, discredited and pulled us out of World Health Organization, and then blamed China for ""creating"" COVID 19.  That's how we ended up with his "" 'gina flu"" and ""Fauci ouchy"" and 1.2 million Americans dead and not all of them ""old people with underlying health issues.""  Science tell us this most likely occurred naturally, as most do.   Fauci had no role or financial interest in anything promoted by these idiots.

"Advice to my fellow Democrats, stop saying the lab leak theory is a conspiracy theory. It was deemed the most likely scenario by the FBI, the Department of Energy, and the CIA via a report issued under Biden that he chose not to release (was released under Trump). Funny enough the FBI and the Energy Department concluded it originated from different bio research labs in Wuhan. The reason people are angry about this is the dishonesty about the funding of dangerous research in Wuhan by the NIH and the effort to silence people who brought that up. Fauci is not a hero in this story, sorry. And at this point when people say lab leak conspiracy theory it's like Republicans saying climate change is a hoax. It's done purely without thought for political effect by people who are incapable of doing any research on the issue or ever believing anything not on the approved list of things to know.",DetectiveBlackCat,2025-04-23T09:20:13,0
