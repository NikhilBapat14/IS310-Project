"Yes, tariffs are a tax, paid by American importers, and typically passed on to American consumers.  That money goes into the general fund along with all the other tax dollars that the US collects.  This is probably the largest tax hike in US history.   If you're a deficit hawk, you might be excited about closing the deficit, except that Trump has said that he's not going to use this revenue to pay down the deficit, he's going to cut taxes elsewhere.     Even worse, it's almost guaranteed that other countries will retaliate, which means American exporters will also suffer.  So people are going to be losing jobs as well as suffering higher prices.     But it's worth it, to bring back American manufacturing, right?  But it's not going to do that either.  Factories take many years to build.  Longer than an election cycle.  Raising taxes and a recession are a death sentence  for the Republican party.  If I'm a manufacturing company, I'm not going to build any new factories, I'm going to ride this out and wait for Democrats to remove these tariffs.  So manufacturing doesn't win either.   No one wins here.  It's such a monumentally stupid thing to do.  ",Nothing_Better_3_Do,2025-04-02T19:23:47,1675

"Basically no one.  I know people often like to say that the economic elite want the economy to crash because then they can buy things for cheap, but that's honestly just goofy conspiracy-mongering.  It's not like they can just crank a dial to ""crashed"", buy everything, then crank it back to ""good"" and now they have everything and nothing else has changed.  Business owners want a good economy because then they have more money and then they have more stuff.  The 2008 Great Recession was not good for anyone.  No one wanted that to happen.  The most dangerous thing about Trump's presidency isn't that it's populated by people who are cynically just trying to get rich.  That would lead to at least a more or less functional economy, even if it would be better for them than anyone else.  The most dangerous thing is that it's populated by actual, genuine true believes in complete nonsense.  Trump genuinely believes that the best way to be a head of state is just punching everyone in the face and taking their lunch money.

"I say from the beginning I’m against tariffs but I’ll answer your questions and play a bit of devils advocate.   > Does that, say, 25% tariff that’s being added to the sale go to the US government?  Yes. Tariffs are a tax that the government collects. Before the Civil War the US relied mostly on tariffs for tax revenue as we didn’t have an income tax. (There are some very nerdy details I’m glossing over, some tariffs aren’t actually tariffs but are excise fees or other such nonsense, but they’re basically tariffs)  > Does it mean that the government can do whatever they want with that money since it’s not our tax dollars being allocated by Congress?  No. All spending is dictated by Congress and the current budget is higher than tax revenue so whatever revenue is generated from these tariffs will help offset that deficit.   > Who benefits from these tariffs since it will take years for US companies to set up these manufacturing facilities, and they’re likely going to be using machines and Al instead of hiring production employees.  Short term it will help fund the government. So either we either cut income taxes, or we pay down the debt, or we add less to the debt each year, or we spend even more. Middle term it will benefit construction workers who will be building these new factories because that can’t be automated. Long term it will benefit the new employees of the factories because not everything can be automated or it’s easier not to automate it and just have a human do it. It’s also a benefit in general to be self sufficient because if some nut gets in power in another country they could charge us more for their exports, though that doesn’t seem likely (big /s, Trump is that nut).   > My feeling on this is that it will be impossible to make all products 100% here in the US. Manufacturers will still order parts from other countries with a 25% tariff (or whatever it is), then the pieces that are made here will be more expensive because of the workforce and wages, so we will inevitably be paying more for products no matter which way you spin it.  Feature, not a bug. The idea is that manufacturing jobs pay more than service industry jobs so more people will be making more money so they can spend more money and a rising tide lifts all boats. Weather or not this works I don’t know  > So, who exactly wants these tariffs?   Mostly just Trump. He’s been consistent on this since the 80s. He thinks tariffs are good and only benefit America. Almost everybody disagrees with him.   There has to be a a group of people somewhere that will benefit because it’s not being stopped.  It’s not being stopped because there really isn’t a way to stop it. Trump is using emergency powers to adjust tariffs and Congress doesn’t have a say because they gave the President (in general, not Trump specific) that power. Congress could pass a law revoking these tariffs but Trump would veto it and you’d need a super majority in both Houses of Congress to overturn that veto. If enough constituents call their representatives and senators they could be motivated to do it but we aren’t there yet.   I think I covered all the important parts. Like I said, this is mostly from a pro tariff POV and I personally think they’re stupid. If I missed anything someone let me know!",kingjoey52a,2025-04-02T19:58:20,12
The biggest winners are domestic manufacturers who want to eliminate competition from foreign competitors for a larger share of domestic consumers and who already do not care about losing market share outside of the US.

"No one, really, other than the wealthy because Trump wants to replace income taxes with tariffs for the funding for the federal government. So the wealthy don't have to pay income taxes but *everyone* has to pay more for everything due to price increases.  It's a regressive form of tax.  Whatever the increase in goods and products are in the US, say, 25%, whereas with progressive income taxes, the poor generally don't pay much in taxes, if at all (excluding the social security, unemployment etc), while the rates go up depending on how much more people make.    So, everyone, including the poor, will pay 25% more due to these import taxes but the wealthy get their tax rates cut from 38% or whatever they are down to 25% on things they buy.   So, a poor family only making $30,000 who normally doesn't pay income taxes due to standard deductions, child deductions, etc., will now be indirectly paying a 25% on everything they buy. Since people who are poor or lower middle class generally spend everything they make because they don't make enough to save since they live paycheck to paycheck, they will be essentially paying 25% tax on their $30,000. Their taxes will go up from $0 to a whopping $7,500.  The best way to look at this is they will have purchasing power of only $22,500 after tariffs go in effect. They'll just be 25% poorer while the wealthy and billionaires will be 25% wealthier or, if you presume they spend everything they make, they will be 14% wealthier (37%\* tax cut with an added 25% import tax).   Of course this is an oversimplification.  I'm not claiming these are all exact numbers. It's just for illustration purposes.  Rates and calculations will vary and are more nuanced than what I typed.  \* Current the highest income tax bracket rate",Ex-CultMember,2025-04-03T00:30:23,3

Now that he’s firmly established a political kayfabe for the tariffs as a defiant and determined act of economic nationalism, he can launch a new international trade game show that I would name Let’s Make A Deal That Will Make Me Richer.  Trump and his team of loyal and amoral sycophants can now start negotiating with the tariff-bullied nations of the world to both make trade concessions AND find ways of putting money into the pockets of Trump and his personal allies, just like he’s done with the recent concessionary lawsuit settlement from ABC, and with a conciliatory commitment of $100 million in pro bono legal services from major law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher.  With every trade concession from a targeted nation, Trump can claim victory and justification for his tough approach.

Everybody loves a winner, longterm damage to America’s global position and power notwithstanding.

I also expect that the value of the Trump meme coin—so serendipitously launched in January—will see a remarkable rise in value throughout the second Trump presidency.

"Most Trump voters wanted 2 main things.    1. Slower Economic Growth.   They wouldn't use that terminology preferring to call the same thing ""less cultural change"".   But this is Trump's main methodology to deliver that.   It is easy, unlike deporting large numbers of immigrants, which takes work and competence.  But if you do a trade war, the economy doesn't grow or even declines.  He is fulfilling his voter's desires.  2. More Powerful Federal Government that is more intrusive into people's lives.  They would use the term ""America to be Strong/Great/Respected again""  This policy delivers on that too.   As the cost of tube socks at Walmart goes up, you are feeling the power of a big government imposing costs on your life.  For the majority of Trump supporters they are willing to bear this pain so long as their neighbors suffer as well.  \--------  All that being said, the main beneficiaries are anti-American dictators and oligarchs.

"Before the Income Tax, the US government was almost entirely funded with broad tariffs across all imports. For much of the nations history, import tariffs were in the 30-55% range.   Basically, nations invest in infrastructure and good laws and corruption-free courts and police and things that inspire consumer confidence to make markets attractive to other nations. Other nations need to pay for the privilege to access those markets, because it requires investment.   After WWII, many of the world’s nations were destroyed, and tariffs were largely eliminated to help the world rebuild. Income taxes became popular and tariffs as a government funding source didn’t really return. The end result however is that it’s slowly wiped out the middle class in developed nations and companies have moved many operations and headquarters offshore to avoid taxes.

"Nobody benefits from tariffs. They create economic drag that hurts everyone.   Think of the economy as a to-do list that you want to get done as efficiently as possible. Given a free market, manufacturers have a huge incentive to cut costs by even fractions of a percent, leading to production that is as efficient as possible. Tariffs prevent that process.   Think of it this way: what if you put a tax on road machinery, so that all roads had to be built with shovels. Who benefits? The answer is nobody, we are all worse off, spending more to get crappier roads. What about shovel manufacturers? They may get a short term boost, but they live in the world too, so their standard of living drops in the long run as customers are poorer and their own lives are more expensive and less convenient.

"Tariffs are pretty bad for construction. If you’re building something, it’s going to cost more and you’re going to have to sell it at a higher price. In NYC, housing supply is already cramped so you can expect a trailing ADDITIONAL rise in rents about 18 months from now assuming housing output stays constant. That’s a safe assumption given that interest rates remain unchanged.  If you’re a big real estate holding company that has stopped building, things are a bit different. Assuming you’re not constructing anything, comparable rents for newer properties are going to rise which will create an inverse filtering effect. Think about it like this.  5 people: A B C D E  Before tariffs, their incomes meant they sorted like:   A and B paid top market rents and competed with each other but A always won, B got a good unit but not the best | C and D got mid-market apartments | E remained homeless because we don’t have enough housing.  After tariffs, given no additional policy changes, they will sort A | B C D | E, or even A | B C | D E as B enters the mid-market and effectively lobbies for things like unit combinations and more space by being able to outbid C D and E with higher service level / unit quality expectations.  B adds upward price pressure to the mid-market range because he can’t compete with A at all.  So if you’re a landlord, assuming you can keep your expenses down, you’re profiting in the long run. If you are anyone else, you’re kinda screwed.  I think Trump may be smarter than we give him credit for.

"good question: pretty much everyone in America except for the big corporations. If you've ever said ""tax the rich"", this is that.  Those corporations will see increased costs due to the taxes, and that money will go to the government which can use it to actually help the people.   In theory some of these companies would try to move their manufacturing back to the US to get around that, which would also be good. It might create new jobs; even with heavy automation you'd still need at least a few thousand people to oversee everything, but even if new jobs aren't created, local automation of this stuff is good because it lowers overall production costs and, if people have less money to actually buy the thing and it's cheaper to produce, prices would have to go down; there's just less money going into it from both sides.  Not to mention the various environmental and workers rights benefits to not using entire fleets of giant gas guzzling ship engines to shuffle each individual part back and forth between various child-labor factories  Some complain that this will cause an increase in prices (an argument that its core is essentially saying that any attempt to actually harm corporations is bad because it will invoke their wrath like some sort of vengeful god), but I'd argue that they don't actually have the ability to do that. Like, the average family can already barely afford food, rent, and insurance. *CAN* barely afford. If prices went up, revenue would actually go down because people literally do not physically have the additional money to hand to the cashier. Like, are you seriously claiming that companies were previously deliberately undercharging for their products just, like, out of generosity? Prices are kinda are kinda stuck where they are and increased production costs don't magically change that.  and while some may attempt to cut costs by firing people, that just means the end of the hegemony of big corporations over their own industry, combined with a large supply of highly experienced working-age people who have the desire for a job, some money since they were employed until recently, and less competition from big business even in previously saturated niches. That is a perfect recipe for new small businesses. American dream's back online baby.  It would even be relatively easy for them to get venture capital since investors are in desparate need of somewhere to park their money that isn't stocks because of the recession, isn't currency because of the inflation that'll cause, and isn't bonds because of widespread distrust in the government. New startups provide that.  this is literally good for everyone and only bad for big businesses, yet it's universally opposed.",Anon_cat86,2025-04-07T18:08:57,1
"What has driven the top 1% of wealth growth by $79 trillion over the past 50 years in America?  Over the past 50 years, $79 trillion has moved from the bottom 90% of Americans to the top 1%.  To put that in perspective, in 2023 alone, $3.9 trillion of that wealth moved upward. If that money had stayed with the bottom 90%, every full-time worker in that group could have gotten a $32,000 raise that year. Instead, it went to the richest of the rich.  This is not a one-time event - it's been building since 1975.  Back in the decades after World War II, America's economy was growing, and so were people's incomes - pretty evenly across the board.  But starting in the 1970s, things changed. The bottom 90%—most workers—saw their share of the nation’s income shrink, while the top 1% saw theirs explode.  In 2019, the bottom 90% earned less than half of all taxable income, down from two-thirds in 1975. Meanwhile, the top 1%’s income grew by more than 300% from 1975 to 2018, far outpacing the nation’s overall growth.  So why did this happen?  First, economic growth stopped benefiting everyone equally.  Policies like tax cuts for the wealthy and fewer regulations for big businesses helped the top 1% accumulate more money.  Second, inflation, with rising prices, ate away at the value of wages for ordinary workers, adding about $10 trillion to the wealth gap.  Third, the share of income going to the bottom 90% just kept falling, even as the economy grew overall.  This shift didn’t happen by accident. Choices made by leaders—like cutting taxes for billionaires, allowing corporations to merge into giants, and weakening workers’ bargaining power—pushed money upward.  Over time, these decisions added up to create a gap between the ultra-wealthy and the rest that is wider than ever.  Basically, the rich keep getting richer, and the poor keep getting poorer.  For the bottom 90%, this means stagnant wages, a harder time buying a home, and less security for the future.  For the top 1%, this means more power and influence, with their wealth now matching that of the bottom 90% combined.  This is now threatening the entire world, as a handful of super-rich people control America and are now trying to transfer this to the entire world.  Remember that inflation, recession and even a Great Depression are a good fit for the super-rich, as it acts as a regressive force, disproportionately hurting those with lower incomes and fewer assets, while benefiting the wealthy through asset appreciation. Thus, inflation and recession only serve to increase economic inequality.",Osldenmark,2025-04-08T03:15:01,1

"""the intention of tariffs is that companies will move to manufacturing items here in the US rather than buy overseas""  That is ludicrous on the surface of it.   Either it is someone's purpose, and they are idiots, or it's just bullshit said to appease the public, pick one.  How long would it take for companies to actually ""move"" here?  Decades.   How about all the various parts and materials needed in manufacturing--those have to move too.   Another question: who works in these factories, and for how much?   Does anyone really think Americans will work for anything close to Chinese wages, if they work at all at such menial jobs given any kind of choice?  (Other than migrant workers of course, but of course those are being flown/bused out of the country).  Not to mention environmental laws and regulations, though of course the GOP will remove as many of those as they can.   Who needs clean water anyway.  Even if companies DID want to move here based on tariffs--they'd be nuts to make a decision like that based on the inconsistency so far.  The tariffs have been threatened, some applied, some removed, some paused, then the numbers change and that's like in a month or too.  Companies are going to base their long-term decisions on this insanity?  Hardly.  Let's say they did magically ""come back"".   So the end result of a bunch of Americans making products here in 20 years are products that cost much higher anyway.   Companies will just stay where they are, or go to Viet Nam etc first, and raise their prices since they'd have to anyway with an American factory.  It's a sick joke.   Trump of course is currently saying ""many companies are coming back"" or something to that effects.  Present tense.   The press should be asking him:  **name one company.**   The fact that he's just lying so baldly tells you plainly what this intention is, it has zero to do with companies moving back here.

"Whether you agree with him or not, it helps to understand his perspective by not viewing tariffs through the orthodox economic lens and rather through realpolitik moves.  Economically yes, tariffs will hurt the economy. But it’s clear that China in the past leveraged its economic power for political purposes (eg censoring Hollywood movies, restricting what’s taught in overseas universities). They are securing their own supply of critical minerals and training their population in advanced manufacturing. To continue operating under the ideals of free-trade when you have a country that trades in bad faith is just setting yourself up for failure.  Supply chain independence from China is a stated goal for the administration, not only for reasons of trade but for security. If you don’t have independent supply chains to produce crucial goods, you don’t have national security.  Trump is also working on devaluing the dollar, essentially moving on from the Bretton Woods era. Devaluing the USD would theoretically result in cheaper exports.  I’m not arguing on the effectiveness of the policy since it remains to be seen, but you won’t get your rationale if you purely focus on the economics.

"The decline of our export trade accompanied by a substantial in­crease in our imports over the past 50 years is certainly cause for concern. According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, the U.S. goods and services trade deficit was $74.6 billion as of last April. Now seems to be an appropriate time to examine the adequacy of current American trade policies with respect to their impact on the trade balance.   With the growth of worldwide economic interdependency, the tenuous position of the dollar in the international money markets, the questionable technological superiority of the U.S., the anticipated U.S. constraints aimed at curbing domestic inflation, and no foreseeable improvement in the trade balance, the trade deficit is increasingly accepted as an economic trend disadvantageous for the United States. Attention of the President and the Congress toward addressing this ""problem"" seems warranted as the surge in Chinese imports cost the U.S. 3.7 million jobs between 2001 and 2018. However, Trump’s Chinese tariffs resulted in the federal government collecting billions in new revenue, but they cost Americans $19.2 billion.

"There are empty factories all over America that have been snatched up by Blackrock, Vanguard, and State Street. Manufacturing has already been planned by many companies and they will be renting these facilities. The idea that this is some surprise is naive, I could concede that maybe the tariffs to this extent may not have been factored in, but honestly, going harder sooner will help heal the wound faster.   This is going to hurt in the short term, but in the long term, the US wins big. The US has too many advantages that are intangible (like geography and local resources), and the rest of the world is reliant on the US consumer (among many other things) to resist for very long.  The BIG loser here (this is the scary part) is China. Their economy is heavily reliant on the United States and the EU, and their population is aging, and their economic growth is unsustainable.  Even if China could do more deals with EU to make up for the lost revenue with doing business in the US it won't really work because too many of thier wealthy people (who are still Chinese citizens and paying taxes) have interests in the US and the EU would lose support from the US in many ways if they did that which would mean they would really have to bolster thier military and fast (who do you think they would be buying from? Yup, that's right ""Merica"") so what China would have to do is start a world war or a pandemic that could kill off large swaths of their aging population (that sounds eerily familiar).   Those 2 possible scenarios are what I worry about most, in the event of war I don't think China could actually compete with the US even if they try to flood thier media with propaganda boasting military might and I don't think they would even want to because it guarantees many men of fighting age would die and coincidentally they are who you need to support an economy of increasingly reliant old people. The far more likely scenario is another manufactured pandemic to thin out the aging population as well as slow down the naive American population who follow the media like the pied piper into the river of ignorance.

"Your entire explanation exists in a vacuum where only the US economy exists.   The idea behind these tariffs (whether it works or not) is that the US is the single most influential economy on the planet and simultaneously by far the most militarily powerful (meaning no one can just go to war with us over trade). Therefore the US can afford to throw its weight around to get better trade deals. Other nations cannot. Not all nations will collaborate against the US for a slew of reasons, only some factions *might* try. Also the idea that China just *steps in* being a loss is flawed. It’s likely seen as desirable to the US for China to start picking up the tab on a lot of the global welfare bills the US has historically paid.   Again, that’s the idea. Whether or not it works remains to be seen.   But just explaining it as if you live in a vacuum where only the US economy exists is both ignorant and obnoxiously self important. ",watchandwise,2025-04-02T20:37:27,-5

I'm curious how true this will actually end up being, because all of the analysis I've seen of it uses the first order effects only: tariffs applied to the current import amounts. But that's not the entire story: these will decrease the amount of imports, reducing the tariff revenue.  Retaliatory ones will drop exports, both will decrease general economic activity, all of which will decrease other forms of tax revenue.

"This is close to right. We can't tell the future.  The purpose of tariffs is correctly stated.  The issue is that tariffs are often lifted before they have had a chance to take full effect.  Tariffs for retaliatory purposes are a bad idea.  There are other ways to punish.  Tariffs to move revenue-generating operations back to the tariff-applying company are beneficial if they remain in place long enough for the manufacturing (in our case) to relocate.  It will take several years.  It does take time to build manfacturing facilities but not as long as everyone things.  I've worked in plants that went from dirt pad to manufacturing complex goods like air conditioners in two years.  In my opinion we need three things and tariffs are one leg of the need.  We need to keep taxes as they are.  No cuts.  We have to cut spending.  Only the necessities should be paid (health care, defense, infrastructure).  We may even have to do some radical things like preclude social security benefits on people that exceed asset levels. Finally, tariffs.

"I'm relatively wealthy and this is not how rich operate. Rich typically don't sell much. They hold. That's how they become rich. They need an intrinsic reason to sell a company not an extrinsic because if you sell, you pay 20% capital gains tax at least. That's a solid loss that you're not getting back, while a 20% market crash is very rare in US history and usually it recovers within a couple years.  Also there is a lot of foreign investment in US and if they start to flow out, there is really no returning to the old stock prices. This is actually started to happen. Money is now flowing from US to Europe.  So for this plan to work, rich should've sold their majority stake without triggering a crash themselves and then either buy back but hoping they're not net negative after tax or buy somewhere else. In any case it is impossible to exit en-masse without triggering a crash so that math does not check out.  They're speculating that with the money earned from tariffs and spending cuts, they can afford tax cuts to rich but if the market is %20 down, removing %20 capital gains would leave you exactly at the same place. Any bigger crash would net you in the negative territory.  So this is a stupid idea that has no upside at all!",OnAYDIN,2025-04-04T11:56:35,1

"I don't think there's any 'lying', the gov has been quite transparent with their methodology.  Its basically using the trade deficit with each country as the de-facto effect of all trade policy.  As stated, things like market protective policies, tariffs on individual goods, government subsidization of industries, etc. all have effects on international trade.  They are using the overall deficit as the sum effect of these policies, since weighing every policy across every market across every country is impossible, and are using a tariff as a simple reciprocal for the deficit.  Seems short sighted to me, but at least its an interesting and transparent economic theory.  Now, whether that is a valid measurement is something else entirely, but they are at least being quite straight-forward with what they are doing.  One can easily imagine a situation where we buy country' A's goods, country A buys B's goods, and country B buys our goods, and everybody wins.  But the simple methodology employed by the administration would make this look like country A is taking advantage of us, and we are taking advantage of country B.  But at least when you are transparent with how you're doing it, country A should be able to make a solid case for why it should not receive the std reciprocal tariff.

Ok I've looked deeper into it. Here's my revised list:,Evader9001,2025-04-06T19:21:03,1
"Well for one thing, I work for a US company who manufactures things, so my company is one of the ones who will be put in the position of “passing the increase along to the consumer” or cutting staff or reducing profitability because we import components and raw materials as part of our manufacturing process. I’m not happy about that, obviously.   The importer can try to negotiate a lower price, obviously, but never as low as the entire tariff, and if you are a US importer of components bidding against a company who manufactures their stuff in a different country, you’re going in to that negotiation with the entire tariff as a handicap that the foreign manufacturer doesn’t have to deal with.  Obviously my company will be able to negotiate lower prices in some cases, but with tariffs this high on goods from so many countries, we’re not going to have much negotiating power because there just aren’t that many companies which produce the components we need.   My company already started opening a foreign subsidiary a few months ago to mitigate this risk.   Who cares if US consumers will have to face a price increase of 100% of the tariff or just 50% of the tariff? It’s still a tax, we still can buy less for our money because more money goes to the government. Why do you care if some foreign company becomes a little less profitable?   I care about how much I can earn at work and how much I can buy with my money. And if you’re earning all your money from the US, and investing and spending it in the US, this policy only has downsides for you. Personally, I’m shifting my investment strategies and have already made plans to physically spend much less time in the US so more of my day-to-day spending will be unaffected. But not everyone has that much flexibility with work and assets.",mountainunicycler,2025-04-03T08:54:51,1
"Right? I’m dumbfounded at the willful ignorance here. It’s not just this person, but I see this everywhere, even in the media. I have an accounting degree and own a business, and I’m just like wtf? How do people not get this? Yes we will have to pay part of the tariffs but only an idiot would think the importing country always pays 100% of the tariffs. I mean if that were the case, then why would we care about other countries’ tariffs on the US?",jrb9249,2025-04-03T08:15:11,0
"The fact remains that the tariffs are a tax, which is paid to the US government, by the US company who imports it.   Yes, it is possible the importer might be able to negotiate, but when tariffs are this high across this many countries, US importers will have much less negotiating power.   We care about tariffs because they are an additional tax which reduces the ability of people like you and I to buy and sell the things we want to, because a big chunk of our money has to go to the government instead.    I work for a company who does manufacturing in the United States… but a few months ago they announced they were opening a foreign subsidiary because the risk that trump might put tariffs in place was high enough for them to start preparing right away. With these tariffs it will make less sense to manufacture in the US because we have to pay additional tax on all the components and raw materials we need. So in the short term, yes, our company might have to bear the costs through layoffs or reduced profitability but the long term play would be to stop manufacturing here to remain competitive globally, and then just sell the product into the US so that only US customers are affected by the tariff, or keep some of the current US manufacturing capacity fixed targeting only the US demand and invest in new capacity elsewhere.   So yeah trump definitely just announced that as an American who works for a manufacturing company I won’t be getting my bonus this year…",mountainunicycler,2025-04-03T08:34:42,2
