Imagine being scared of books. Fucking cowards.,Kernburner,2025-05-09T18:06:43,36
">The committee has already developed a list of search terms to help military leaders identify books that may need to be removed. The terms include: “Affirmative action,” “anti-racism,” “allyship,” “diversity in the workplace,” “gender transition,” “white privilege,” and “critical race theory,” according to an attachment to the memo.  Shouldn't a somewhat accurate account of history be taught at military academies? This is absurd.",dblan9,2025-05-09T18:01:16,19

"The purge of the pentagon continues. It’s important to note that previous historical examples of military purges over ideological lines have been disastrous. The price of the red army leadership by Stalin (as well as military weapon designers etc.) was disastrous for the Soviet Union and contributed to the early successes of the Nazi army when it invaded the Soviet Union, surely leading to countless deaths of civilians and troops that could have been avoided.",P1xelHunter78,2025-05-09T18:26:15,4

"The ignorant think that’s smart people’s power, reading and writing books, and it is; rather than raise themselves up to smart-person levels (and read) they’re going to bring down the intelligence levels of everybody else. Reminds me of that scene in Indiana Jones where Vogel was grilling Jones Sr. about his diary, asking him what the diary tells him (Jones Sr. ) and doesn’t tell us (the Nazi’s) and Jones Sr. Says “it tells me that goose-stepping morons like yourself should try reading books instead of burning them”. Great scene…",OkWillingness3803,2025-05-10T17:18:47,1
