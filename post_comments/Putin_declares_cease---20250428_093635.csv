How many times does it need to be stated that the Ukrainian constitution prevents cessation of land due to forceful invasion. Zelenskyy cannot legally cede Crimea even if he wanted to. A peace deal requiring Ukraine to acknowledge legal Russian occupation and ownership is not a peace deal. This whole thing is an absolute farce.,AlkaSelse,2025-04-28T09:45:03,23

"I think funding Ukraine like we WERE is the solution, but sadly the EU will need to step up to fill the void left by us. It's either that or boots on the ground like Russia is doing with NK soldiers.",YouShallNotPass92,2025-04-28T12:55:56,2

"Funding Ukraine like we were wasn't getting the job done, just mostly a stalemate (less, considering Russia seems to have the upper hand at this point).  Regardless, as I said, it seems the rest of the world is no longer willing or able to continue funding Ukraine. I sincerely doubt any country is going to support sending troops.

They would also be exchanging humans. Would you consider it a win if trump decided to just give wherever you live to Russia? Suddenly you're subject to new laws and taxes and you can't afford or aren't allowed to leave. Sounds super great,sirhackenslash,2025-04-28T10:18:59,3
"You don't believe that, you are just saying it because you know you'll never have to make any sort of sacrifice.",Public_Front_4304,2025-04-28T13:04:03,2
I'd argue a stalemate kinda is getting the job done. The point is to not let Russia win and take the country all the while they continue draining their own resources. Does it suck? Yeah. But it's better than the alternative of capitulation to Russia and the ongoing consequences of that + the economic benefits of them getting Ukraine.,YouShallNotPass92,2025-04-29T07:45:18,1
I don‚Äôt get why this sub is downvoting peace.  Is it because it‚Äôs Trump that will get credit?  Who cares!  Peace is peace.  Sure Crimea was Ukraines and if they eventually want to break the peace and go on a revenge tour on the criminality then we will be trapped in a cycle of violence like the Middle East.,dbag3o1,2025-04-28T09:51:53,-11
"They should be allowed to leave.  Just like anyone should in your hypothetical example, just as the gazans should be able to leave too.   That should be a criterion for peace and land exchange.

"We want peace, but we do not want to reward the aggressor for their aggression and to force a soverign country to give up their land.  I don't care about credit.

"You don't understand geopolitics.  Putin is a murderous monster.  Russia has been harassing the free world for a century, murdering millions.

And how are these people supposed to pay for up-ending their entire lives to leave? Where are they going to go? Every country around Gaza already said fuck no to taking them in so trump can build his casinos there.

"Geez, read a history book!  Displacement happens in war all the time and people go where they can to start their lives again.
