"It is really sad to see the Kennedy family become like this. It is a curse, it really is....",nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-04-29T09:40:44,43
To answer the question without reading the article: because he's a brain damaged former addict who had a tapeworm eat his brain and die who's been catapulted into power by another charlatan.,Harmless_Drone,2025-04-29T09:46:18,30
"Because he's a moron whose pathetic ego and desperate need to be ""special"" allows him to rationalize that he's in the select few people ""smarter"" than the vast majority of physicians and scientists.",tellmewhenimlying,2025-04-29T09:46:28,14
"Name checking the Kennedys as ""architects of the disability rights movement"" is pretty bold. Rosemary was lobotomized, institutionalized and hidden away from public view and knowledge in order to keep sanitized the Kennedy name and mystique. RFK isn't an aberration.",bredonhill,2025-04-29T10:04:56,21
It's simple: He's evil.,squiddygoat,2025-04-29T09:59:37,8
Because he's getting paid to destroy America.,insuproble,2025-04-29T09:42:12,5
"From Joseph MacBeth is president of the National Alliance of Direct Support Professionals:  ""For more than six decades, the Kennedys were not just allies but architects of the disability rights movement. That’s why it’s so deeply painful—and profoundly ironic—that a Kennedy is now supporting policies that would dismantle what his own family so fiercely built.  Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., there is still time to lead with courage. You can still reverse your endorsement of cuts to Medicaid—cuts that would strip $880 billion from a program that provides vital services to children, the elderly, and people with disabilities.""

Because he doesn't actually care about the American people and especially not people with disabilities,Liiiiiiiidooooooooo,2025-04-29T09:43:56,2
His family also lobotomized one of their own because they were inconvenient to their public lives.,mykonoscactus,2025-04-29T09:47:51,6
"All Trump appointments are cruel, subservient people. That is a requirement from the job. Appealing to their morality is pointless.",Simmery,2025-04-29T09:48:35,3
"Imagine if a president had appointed a flat earth conspiracy idiot as administrator of NASA. Now imagine if a bunch of idiots were defending this by saying stupid crap like ""You're not even giving him a chance!"" and ""Maybe this is what NASA needs, a different perspective!""  THAT'S what you cons sounds like with RFK Jr leading HHS. He's an antivaxxing moron who promotes germ theory denialism. It's equally as stupid as a flat earther heading NASA, but much, much more dangerous.",stjack1981,2025-04-29T10:59:40,3
Nazis don't believe in supporting disability.   Their ultimate solution to the problem is to transport disabled people to concentration camps.,crazybones,2025-04-29T11:23:41,3
RFK Jr. is a junky piece of shit. He should be institutionalized at best.,misterlakatos,2025-04-29T09:41:28,4
"Because: I got mine, fuck you",bubbasass,2025-04-29T10:20:24,2
This fuck is so far removed from his family it's ridiculous. He's a KINO.,jdmknowledge,2025-04-29T10:27:23,2
He’s a Nazi simp and fucking grifter,the_lost_black_hole,2025-04-29T11:51:53,2
Just ask Mary Joe . Oh wait .,Certain_Event558,2025-04-29T12:11:47,2
"because they don't fit his anti-seed oil / hfcs agenda   maybe it's just me but we have more pressing concerns than what dyes are in our food. Oooh, the nasty dyes are gonna kill me. So scared.",MichaelPFrancesa,2025-04-29T09:45:44,1
He’s the worst Kennedy and that’s saying something considering Edward was responsible for a woman’s death,Black_Otter,2025-04-29T13:49:28,1
Brain worms I assume.,MidLifeCrysis75,2025-04-29T14:02:38,1
Because he’s a case study in affluenza,BriefausdemGeist,2025-04-29T14:36:42,1
They probably always knew he was a fuckin brain dead loser,L1QU1D_ThUND3R,2025-04-29T15:21:01,1
Because he is resentful of the fact that he is a sack of shit that no one in his family respects,solarus,2025-04-29T22:59:01,1
Didn't the Kennedys get a lobotomy performed on rosemary Kennedy and locked her away in a mental health facility for the rest of her life? ,cryingpotato49,2025-04-29T11:11:10,0
The Kennedy family came out in strong opposition to RFK jr.  He is the outlier.,Myviewpoint62,2025-04-29T10:24:34,35
"The Special Olympics are more well known than what Joe did to Rosemary. I don't think it was intentional (Eunice was close to her sister, so probably genuinely wanted to do good by disabled folks), but it's done a lot to pretty up the family's reputation on the subject.",egosomnio,2025-04-29T13:05:23,3
"The Joe Kennedy Sr, had the lobotomy done without the knowledge or approval of his wife and family. I feel that the Kennedy's felt deep sadness of of the loss of the sister they had known.  And in response, they chose to champion those with disabilities ",SerenityRaging,2025-04-29T13:27:09,3
Yeah they all recognize he's a failure of a human being,pupbuck1,2025-04-29T10:30:23,21
"No, his cousin (Caroline K.) wrote a letter, but that’s it. Where were the rest of them? I hoped the Shriver kids would step up more because their mom established Special Olympics. But it was nothing but silence. So sad.",LostmydadtoCOVID,2025-04-29T16:52:45,5
His father would disown and disavow him.,Crunchberry24,2025-04-29T12:08:28,6
Likely would have had him lobotomized,pupbuck1,2025-04-29T12:31:49,3
