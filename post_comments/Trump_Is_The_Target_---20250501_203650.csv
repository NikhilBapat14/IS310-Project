Protests across the PLANET against trump.  But corporate media doesn’t think that is worth covering.  Billionaires killed journalism,Cyndakill88,2025-05-01T20:51:06,58
I attended one of those demonstrations today. It was my 7th protest so far against Trump. It was very exciting and we had some great speakers. I saw some great posters.    But we've had a fascist to take-over.   Waving some placards around and chanting some chants is not going to stop America from becoming Hitler's Germany or Mussolini's Italy within the next year.      The Italians in 1922 and the Germans in 1933 were helpless before the onslaught of fascism and were never able to stand in its way. Without a plan of action America will be the same as them. No one has come up with a plan of action.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-01T21:13:15,23

Billionaires kills everything good for the people.   Like democracy.,BahutF1,2025-05-02T00:18:39,4
They'll cover whatever they can make money on. There's no market for news about protests.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-01T21:14:33,7
It’s not Festivus - an airing of grievances.   The placards should say what we want: impeach. Convict. Remove.  The same bat channel and same bat time every week - Friday 7p? Sat 4p? Something that is standard and doesn’t require organizers,Andouiette,2025-05-01T22:58:33,8
"It was far, far more different for Germany and Italy back then. Ruined or really poor countries. There was no past example of fascism. It take several years to them to go to this point. There was real opposition attempt and blood in the street.    America have far less, if not none, excuse.",BahutF1,2025-05-02T00:25:44,6
You don’t think the major news corps are biased and have their own political agenda they try to push?,Own-Category-7888,2025-05-02T08:47:34,1
"Well the ""poor"" part might be happening soonish if Trump tariffs continue. He's also messing with the bread and circus pipeline by hurting food imports and electronics. The less people have and the more he continues to boast about the ""good"" he's doing the more focus gets put on him.  And I'm not saying it can't happen, but the sheer size and diversity of the USA is another factor. Italy and Germany are small by comparison, lots of fascist regimes globally are small because it's easier to control with force. In Russia's population is mostly in one tight area.   Trying to spread all the military across the US would spread it thin, not even including military personnel who would just abandon post if told to fire on US citizens.",Xikar_Wyhart,2025-05-02T06:27:34,3
"No I think they're strictly in it for the money. Remember they are not ""news"" corporations. Their product is not ""news"".      I don't understand why so many Redditors don't get basic economics.    **Every company in the world, big or small, has a product or service they supply and they have customers**.  The customer is who gives them money. What the customer gets in exchange for that money is the product.   Boeing for example makes airplanes and their customers are airlines.     The customers of ""news corporations"" are advertisers. The advertisers give them money. What do the advertisers get in return for that money? Eyeballs, in other words viewers.    So eyeballs are the product.   Fox News is making tons of money because they've discovered that radically conservative news is good bait to attract eyeballs. That's all they care about. If radically liberal or progressive news was good bait to attract eyeballs they would use that, but **it isn't** because most liberals don't spend as much time in front of the boob tube, and we're not so easily taken in by stupid advertisements so we're not as lucrative to the advertisers.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-02T10:54:31,0
"So true. But America have states, bigger and wealthier than most of European nations..",BahutF1,2025-05-02T06:48:23,1
"I think that’s true to an extent but also fully believe there is politics at play. Simply, yes it’s about money, but it’s also about power.   I don’t appreciate the implication I don’t understand economics just because I asked you a question about your beliefs. That was an asshole assumption, and I don’t appreciate or accept it.",Own-Category-7888,2025-05-03T12:58:09,1
"I said that because you refer to them as ""news corporations"". They are not news corporations.  News is not their business.  Eyeballs are their business.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-03T13:50:13,1
