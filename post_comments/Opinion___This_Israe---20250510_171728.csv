The Israeli military does a lot of sketchy stuff for the US government in areas where Americans can’t use American forces. I suspect that has a lot to do with the government’s unwavering support for Israel and turning a blind eye to the suffering of the innocent Palestinians civilians. I think that erodes American legitimacy in the Muslim world and American interests would be better served by bringing Israel to heal and protecting human rights,WorkingExperience982,2025-05-10T17:27:22,1

"I think that's been pretty obvious since they started treating the Palestinians the way they were treated in most of Europe — becoming that which they escaped. And America has give everything they want to destroy another race. This is nothing to be proud of. And no, that does not make me pro Hamas, Hezbollah or Houthi or anti-Semitic. I'm simply against genocide by bombing a country into dust and starving innocent people to death. Imagine what it would feel like to watch your family to starve to death right in front of your eyes. But what do we do? Give Israel more money and arms because Christians want Israel to control most of the Holy Land to bring the Rapture to fruition.",invalidpassword,2025-05-10T17:44:17,1
