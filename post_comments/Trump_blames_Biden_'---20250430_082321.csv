"A new president was inaugurated. The president who was stepping down met with him and presented him with three numbered envelopes. “Open these if you run into serious trouble,” he said.  Well, a year later and things weren't going well and the new president was catching a lot of heat. He began to panic but then he remembered the envelopes. He went to his drawer and took out the first envelope. The message read, “Blame your predecessor.” The new president called a press conference and explained that the previous president had left him with a real mess and it was taking a bit longer to clean it up than expected, but everything was on the right track. Satisfied with his comments, the press responded positively.  Another year went by and the country continued to struggle. Having learned from his previous experience, the president quickly opened the second envelope. The message read, “Reorganize.” So he fired key people, consolidated departments and cut costs everywhere he could. This he did and the press applauded his efforts.  A year passed and the country was still having problems. The president would have to figure out how to get through a tough election. The President went to his office, closed the door and opened the third envelope. The message said, “Prepare three envelopes.”",wirthmore,2025-04-30T09:03:21,3

Thus, lies like these now are simply his way of testing just how thoroughly he's brainwashed them (i. e., 'If they've bought all this other crap already, let's see what else we can fool 'em with.

In the States many public officials are elected, and in 2025 with social media the capability to tilt opinion based on inaccurate information is huge.  If your Sherriff, DA, Council, Mayors, Commissioners, Superintendents are all elected and not appointed independently by competence then there is a huge risk that over time that political alignment will give way to group think and group action.",_L_R_S_,2025-05-01T03:39:54,1

Exactly.  The growth last quarter was because people knew how amazing Trump was going to be but then Biden sabotaged everything in January with the help of Soros and Xi leading to the decline this quarter which probably isn't even real but a lie created by the deep state but if it's real it's just an attempt to stop the golden age of America by people who hate us here and in china and probably denmark.

The politicizing is an issue for sure because you expose to polarising of agendas sometimes just because it’s the opposite of whatever your opponent wants to do - even if it is the right thing.  But one of the biggest problems was also the lack of regulations regarding TV channels particularly media outlets spreading disinformation or flat out lies with no consequence.,fkmeamaraight,2025-05-01T06:16:46,1

Granted they should have gone after these shitty corporations inflating prices but that’s another discussion.      If Trump never touched anything the economy would still be trending upwards, but he managed to screw that up in 100 days.

">Securing the border, record low illegal crossings You have to admit that at BEST his record so far on this is mixed. Far fewer deportations than the Biden/Obama admins, and he's doing a bunch of it without due process, putting people with no serious crimes into foreign torture prisons, detaining tourists and so destroying the US tourism industry, and and even deporting citizens.   Also, why is this such an important issue for you? How has ilegal immigration negatively affected your life?  >Record high jobs  He's been very bad for the economy so far (and clearly going forward). That can't really be something you like about his performance thus far.   >made English the official language  Why is this important? How has 250 years of no official language negatively affected you?  >standing up to China with tariffs Is he? He keeps going back and forth on tariffs for everyone. Also, it just raises prices. Why do you like inflation and big new taxes?  >and exposing Ukraine corruption  Umm.... this is how I know that you have fallen down a propaganda hole. You care about corruption in Ukraine, which is pretty normal for a country at its stage in development? How about Russia? How about Trump's own MASSIVE corruption? Both of those are far, far worse at this point.   >made NATO pay more instead of US.  This isn't really a thing.

Think about this though. Do you have a tv on with the news on at all times during the day? Probably not because that is insane. Almost every person I have worked with that I found out later was in the cult has a tv on the entire day. An entire day of propaganda. Its all part of the propaganda to trick them into consuming more of it. More fear and lies until as you know they believe the exact opposite of reality and you cant convince them otherwise.
