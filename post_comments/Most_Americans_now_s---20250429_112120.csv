"""Short-term pain for long-term gain""  Okay, buddy, those in power saying that are not going to hurt. Those saying that will not worry about feeding their family or keeping a roof over their head. They won't have to deal with any kind of shortage. No, us peons will be paying the price, and I've yet to hear any kind of idea of how long ""short term"" is and just how hard that pain will hit those of us who aren't ultra wealthy.",Bookshelfhelp,2025-04-29T16:36:44,4
