Like a backwards job interview where you tell them how you're unqualified,30mil,2025-05-09T18:38:10,77
Fun fact. Most medical schools teach very little about public health. There’s a whole separate master’s program for public health.,Traditional-Win-3368,2025-05-09T19:02:15,34

As far as I can tell she washed out of residency. She is not a fully qualified physician.,WonderfulLeather3,2025-05-09T21:08:42,9
"Well, that's awkward, since her Stanford education was the only qualification Trump cited when asked about her nomination. Well, that and RFK likes her.",alleyoopoop,2025-05-09T19:09:19,8
"""Public health"" is a specific sub discipline focused on broadscale health and not the same as individual healthcare. So a lot of doctors not planning to go into public sector work don't focus on it.",muchnycrunchny,2025-05-09T19:19:46,7
Why do members of the Trump team go out of their way to say how little they know?  We get it. We believe you.,Quiet_Property2460,2025-05-10T00:03:33,7
"Having Stanford medical school training would usually be a badge of honor for someone angling to be America’s next surgeon general, but that’s not always the case for Casey Means, a Stanford graduate and Donald Trump’s newest choice for the position. ",sfgate,2025-05-09T18:33:37,6
Can you imagine being this ungrateful you went to an Ivy League school? They would rather stay uneducated to own the libs.,mcolette76,2025-05-09T18:46:57,10
Didn't she drop out after her first Goop trip?,disasterbot,2025-05-09T18:52:20,3
"This is exactly what’s wrong with these people.   Does JD vance sound like HE learned anything at Yale?  Does Hegseth sound like HE learned anything at Princeton?  How about Stuart Rhodes? The insurrectionist?   These people all see education as an ideology that indoctrinates people to be leftists. When in actuality they never allowed information to actually change their perspective. It’s this closed-minded perspective that is the real problem, and every single trump supporter I’ve spoken to all have this trademark characteristic.   Their war on “woke” is a war on truth, science, Law, and basic human rights.  It’s bullshit, they are all liars, cheats, frauds, wannabe gangsters, rapists, and just actual fucking monsters that see everyone as being beneath them. Fuck that. These people need to learn they cannot just push everyone around with their petty beliefs, posing as Christians.   They’re the evil this world needs to extinguish.",HotApplication3797,2025-05-09T22:16:13,3

Let’s not forget that this is what Republicans want for America and are currently actively supporting.,yorapissa,2025-05-10T09:53:29,1
So the nominee for /Surgeon General/ is…not qualified to be a surgeon? And they’re also required to be members of the regular corps of the US Public Health Service according to Wikipedia.,txdmbfan,2025-05-10T17:44:16,1
She went to Stanford Medical   By default she is qualified,Joey-Tuna-Batters,2025-05-09T19:08:38,-48
Yes you can get an MPH as an MD/DO but medical school is meant to teach you to become a physician. Some public health teaching is required for that but there is a reason why there is an entire separate profession which is focused on public health.,acousticburrito,2025-05-09T21:11:03,10
Let’s also call it how it is also she also meets trump’s present ability standards.,No-Medicine-1379,2025-05-10T10:12:36,1
They think appealing to the ignorant masses makes them relatable. Apparently it worked to get them into power.,muchnycrunchny,2025-05-10T11:49:19,1

That’s a pretty low bar for this office.  There are actual qualifications described by law in 42 USC 25. It’s a big stretch to say that someone with her CV is qualified. But par for the course of this Administration.,XenopusRex,2025-05-09T19:35:58,17

"I and others, have very bad things to say about Standford. From the viewpoint of ethics and the survival of the human race: It's critically imparative they correct super massives mistakes regarding ethics. A deep understanding of ethics, is a requirement of being a good business person.  They have absolutely DESTROYED their own credibility by teaching people the exact opposite of that. They operated their MBA program like a bait and switch scam, teaching their students, that's it totally okay to just rip off their clients. Which many of them did. Now, we live in a world where, it's like a competition to see how evil business can be. There is zero awareness that they are hurting people who did nothing wrong.",Actual__Wizard,2025-05-09T19:24:54,3

"I once took a summer course on their campus.  Eye opening. Three eateries in the quad--a custom grill for burgers and such, a coffee shop, and the cafeteria. The cafeteria had gourmet food, like fancy french pastries, all kinds of stuff. At the college I went  to, not even the tea was drinkable at the main cafeteria, and the food was 100% inedible.",FormerUsenetUser,2025-05-09T21:26:00,3
