"Navarro is a true believer.  Lutnick seems to be a lapdog.  Bessent backed Trump because he wanted lower tax rates and deregulation.  He wasn't counting on the tariffs and is trying behind the scenes to reverse the policy.    Bessent is regarded as the proverbial grown up in the room.  If Bessent resigns as he reportedly was threatening to do over Trump's tariff policy, the markets will tank.    If Fed chairman Powell leaves, the markets will tank.    We basically have two people who are holding the US economy together.  This is what you get when you install a dimwitted schoolyard bully as president.",I405CA,2025-04-27T22:14:27,13
">The government we have now, full of stooges like Howard Lutnick, is what’s left.  This is what scares me the most. The first time around it seemed like there were some people in his circle who weren't total sycophants. He was *smarter* this time around when choosing his people. And that's bad news for the rest of us.",Plasibeau,2025-04-27T21:58:35,4

">I always wonder how many people think propaganda is exclusive to one side.  That is poorly contrived deflection for valid criticism of Trump's propagandists.  Also, you deleted a comment that I responded to in another thread.  How long until you delete your comment in this thread?",ResidentKelpien,2025-04-27T22:00:15,12
