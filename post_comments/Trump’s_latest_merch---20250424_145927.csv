What a dumb article.   If Obama starting selling merch for a third term yall would be calling for his head.,rottenavocadotoast,2025-04-24T15:01:12,41
"What a weird article.  >""And there it is.Donald Trump is now selling ‘Trump 2028′ hats on his official website, even though it is unconstitutional for him to run again,""  Is pointing out a fact the same as a head exploding? I don't think so.",La-Boheme-1896,2025-04-24T15:01:31,28
"What a horrible headline. Sure, you gotta go for clicks, but 'making liberal heads explode' is hardly the real story when a president constitutionally barred from being elected again is playing at doing just that.",travio,2025-04-24T15:02:38,19
Im not a lib. It still makes my head “explode” because it’s completely unconstitutional and spits in the face of what binds us together as Americans.,Altruistic_Noise_765,2025-04-24T15:04:04,12
"Well yeah, bragging about the authoritarian, unconstitutional things printed on tacky Chinese-made merch that you want to inflict on the population will upset most reasonable people who have proudly lived by laws and democratic ideals for most of their lives.",RealGianath,2025-04-24T15:04:52,11
wtf is wrong with the headline. are you happy with your country getting rekt?,turkish__cowboy,2025-04-24T15:09:14,8
"My head is fine, glad I don't work for a shit 'newspaper' who's revenue depends on posting their own articles to reddit for empty click money.        I mean, you have a job, congrats, I suppose...but still....",BeverlyHills70117,2025-04-24T15:16:06,7

And dumbfucks will just ignore he is blatantly saying fuck rhe constitution while claiming they totally care about it.,redditlvlanalysis,2025-04-24T15:06:13,3
"I also love dismantling of democracies this close to the weekend...   Wouldn't it be an easier world, if we all fall in line, with one supreme leader guiding and watching over us.. ?Punishing us when we displease him, rewarding us when we please him..?   Good times, more of that please.   Not putting an S here.",Affectionate_Mix5081,2025-04-24T15:25:19,3
Pretending any liberal would be surprised  ignores the fact that liberals have been warning this would happen for almost 10 years now. They are feeling vindication.,theombudsmen,2025-04-24T16:05:44,3
It should make anyone who believes in Democracy & the Constitution's head explode... ,StrangerFew2424,2025-04-24T15:26:17,2
Trump loves fools and the poorly educated.  This liberal just shakes his head at the bottom 50% that fall for his cons.  There’s no sympathy left for MAGAts.,tjk45268,2025-04-24T16:30:52,2
Who gives a shit? We know he lives in fantasy land. What difference does a hat make?  His own constituents are pretty deadset against the idea.,Tony2030,2025-04-24T15:04:21,3

"If people in this country had half a brain it would make ***ALL*** American's ""heads explode"". Republican, democrat, independent and everything in between, everyone should value the constitution of our democracy, the alternative is chaos.",-CJF-,2025-04-24T15:41:25,1
"Yesterday I heard Simon Rosenberg suggest that Trump is not truly trying for a third term, but he says so to keep voters and other politicians from treating him as a lame duck, which helps him keep a better hold on the GOP.  I wouldn't rule out Trump trying for a third term, but Rosenberg's take is convincing.",shelbys_foot,2025-04-24T15:49:26,1
Silly headline and article.,Kid_Serious,2025-04-24T16:34:13,1

"This isn't an excuse to tell people to vote. He legally, constitutionally CANNOT run again.",cakesandpiescnp,2025-04-24T15:18:28,5
Jiffy is an idiot or a troll trying to normalize a president running for a 3rd term. It's very simple. Individual states run elections and we do not have to include Trump on the ballot.,paxwells97,2025-04-24T16:13:41,3
"Well, it's thanks to the lack of voters who couldn't be bothered that's one of the reasons he sits where is now and does what he does.   So, VOTE!!! Otherwise, piss off.",Affectionate_Mix5081,2025-04-24T15:34:27,1
He has presidential immunity and all he has to get the MAGA majority SCOTUS to rule in his favor.   He’s running and you know it.   Vote or piss off.,JiffyDealer,2025-04-24T16:10:49,0
