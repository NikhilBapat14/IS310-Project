"Yeah, we know this. The convicted felon occupying the oval office is a third generation grifter. So, how do we end his unimagined corruption when he has a lifetime stay out of jail pass from a corrupt SCOTUS and a Congress that turns its back on the whole thing while even taking the table scraps of insider trading?  Are there enough public servants and politicians who will stand up to this naked greed? And, since there probably aren't enough, when, officially, will we all have to wear the uniforms of 21st century Nazism to be unmolested in public?",keninsd,2025-05-07T12:20:02,16
"The other day when I was taking a walk when a thought had occurred to me. If I so chose to, I could get 100 T-Shirts silkscreened with some nonsense MAGA saying on it for about $10 a shirt. Then I could setup shop somewhere in BFE or hell even on line and sell them for $50 a shirt, and I'd end up with a nice profit of $4,000. I mean...I've seen what these people will buy. They will literally hand their money over for the dumbest things, remember ""Trumpy Bear"" anyone?",Prudent-Blueberry660,2025-05-07T13:17:50,8

"On April 22nd, Fight Fight Fight LLC, a company with ties to President Donald Trump, announced that the 220 top investors in its meme coin $TRUMP would be invited to meet with Trump himself.  The event was billed as an “intimate private” dinner, but with obvious hints that attendees were buying an elected official’s time. Around the date of the announcement, federal government officials reportedly registered three websites apparently related to the dinner:  thetrilliondollarinner.gov, dinnerforamerica.gov, and thetrillion.gov. At least one, it was reported, temporarily directed to a Department of Commerce login portal, suggesting that the coin was somehow linked to the government.  The coin’s price jumped by more than 50 percent after the dinner was announced, netting Trump and his allies nearly $900,000 in trading fees in just two days.  Two democratic senators demanded an ethics probe into the May 22 dinner, but in February, Trump fired the head of the body that would typically investigate that type of alleged misconduct.  The meme coin dinner is the kind of open graft controversy that would have been unfathomable under previous administrations, even Trump’s first term eight years ago. Now it’s just one of dozens of ways the president and those in his orbit have enriched themselves.  Along the way, they’ve dismantled government watchdogs that crack down on scams of every scale. The president has created his own money-fleecing spin on Reagonomics — instead of promising trickle-down wealth, it’s trickle-down opportunities for fraud.  Trickle-down enrichment starts at the top, with Trump selling access to the White House through promotions like the meme coin dinner. Beneath him are high-profile donors who have bought their way out of accusations of corporate misconduct or outright fraud, particularly the grift-ripe world of cryptocurrency.  As the watchdogs that oversee these companies are hobbled, they leave the door open to small-time scammers who can trust their operations won’t be spotted. And this government chaos creates whole new opportunities — and more vulnerable people — to exploit. At every level, regular people have become little more than collateral damage or prey.  ⏬ Bluesky 'bite-sized' article thread (12 min) with extra links 📖🍿🔊  [https://bsky.app/profile/johnhatchard.bsky.social/post/3lomap62x4c2d](https://bsky.app/profile/johnhatchard.bsky.social/post/3lomap62x4c2d)  [archive.is/K4oZ8](http://archive.is/K4oZ8)",johnnierockit,2025-05-07T18:26:57,2

"I know it sucks. It’s like the time I found a wallet with $160 bucks in it. Plus a social security card. And ID. But no credit cards. I liked thinking about keeping the cash but ultimately wouldn’t be able to return a wallet to someone I  stole from. Plus I looked him up on face book and he was a young guy with a family.   In the end, I was able to contact the guy and when I gave him his wallet (everything still in tact), he insisted on giving me $50. He never expected to get the wallet back, let alone with the money still in it. It literally paid to do the right thing!",beadzy,2025-05-08T08:53:31,2
"It's not 98% of academic papers but 98% of papers in the arts and humanities don't have a citation in the next five years. In social science it was 75% and in hard sciences it was 25%. This all came from a study done in 1991.  However, the study looked at everything published in journals including obituaries and letters to the editor. Things that were never meant to be cited. When those are removed it's 93% in the humanities and 45% of the social sciences.  Still, it's data from 30 years ago. Hard to make conclusions from it.  https://www.vox.com/2015/11/30/9820192/universities-uncited-research",Purify5,2025-05-07T13:44:30,7
So what's your beef with scientific research? I still say you have no understanding of the need for peer reviewed paper and data. Not everything is supposed to create a product or cure something.,AlarmingBeing8114,2025-05-07T12:13:04,8
