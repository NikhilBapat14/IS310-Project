"This event might have been more about greed than stupidity. It has all the earmarks of a short-selling market manipulation scam. They borrow stock, sell it high, tank the market, buy it back low then repay the original stock loan. It's quick, easy money but only if you have no morality and can be confident the market will tank.  And there is no one more confident than our Felon In Chief.  Watch for more maneuvering like this.",Jimxor,2025-04-09T07:15:13,25

Sthg about Trump is a businessman? I genuinely think most adults saw The Apprentice on TV and hear headlines secondhand but don’t look any deeper. That’s the only way it makes sense to me,phap789,2025-04-09T05:30:04,3

Why did people think the guy that fucked up the COVID response could handle wars? And Republicans are trying to raise taxes for most people to cover tax cuts for the rich…people are idiots.,petty_throwaway6969,2025-04-09T02:09:09,16
" We weren't IN any wars, MAGAtard and there were NO new taxes.   Our taxes went up because of your demented, diapered, phat old master.  Now, everything will go up with Shitler's tariffs.  The fact is under Biden we had the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years, all three market indexes hit record highs, the World Bank announced over the summer that the US economy was so strong it stabilized the world economy,  and we finally got infrastructure investment.    Shitler was losing jobs before the pandemic. He also killed 500K Americans with his lies and incompetence.   We will revel in your financial destruction and MAGAt misery.   Enjoy street life.",LOA335,2025-04-09T06:15:59,11
