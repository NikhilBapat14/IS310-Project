So I do not see what we got. All I saw is we agreed to lower tariffs we imposed in the first place. I am confused.,backpackwayne,2025-05-08T10:45:37,5

"Heartwarming to see two losers—one that fucked over its economy with Brexit and the other that’s in the process of fucking over its economy after instigating a worldwide trade war— come together at the losers’ table to pantomime the potentiality of the concepts of a shitty little trade deal. Oh, but the 10% tariffs are staying. ",Sharp_Blueberry_6547,2025-05-08T10:39:43,4
"President Donald Trump said he will make a significant trade announcement with the United Kingdom, yet another sign of some possible relief from historically high tariffs that have threatened serious damage to the US and global economies. Economist Justin Wolfers discusses the significance of a US-UK trade deal.",Happy_Weed,2025-05-08T10:26:28,1

Putting aside the fact that the U.S. already had a trade surplus with the UK before Trump started a trade war with the UK - it is hard to get excited about Trump's supposed solution to a problem he himself created.,Truthisnotallowed,2025-05-08T21:36:07,1
"This is how the GOP works.  Invent/create a problem, ""fix"" said problem by returning to whatever the baseline was before inventing/creating the problem, claim victory, watch voters get excited, and reap rewards in elections.",Archer1407,2025-05-08T11:49:06,12
The UK reduced tariffs on beef (which they still aren't likely to buy from America in significant portions because most US beef still doesn't pass the UK's agricultural standards) and ethanol,Ill_Act_1855,2025-05-08T11:24:58,10
"We seem to import a lot machinery and meds(idk if that constitutes chemicals) from UK but everything else listed seem to be fluff to make it seem like a better looking deal.  Most of those are basically some of Americas biggest goods so if anything, to me at least, it would add more competition for our producers in those industries. Seems pretty dumb but I don’t know enough to really know either way.  EDIT: I believe i confused myself in first read. This actually seems worse than what I thought. Tariffs are higher for us and lower for them. Seems like they got the better deal.",AcidRohnin,2025-05-08T10:58:48,4
