"Looks like the Trump admin was saying they had a criminal case against this person, and in criminal cases NYPD is obligated to share sealed arrest records. The article suggests that there isn’t a ton of actual evidence that money laundering was happening though, so DHS may have lied about a criminal case in order to trick NYPD into handing over records. ",StormOk7544,2025-05-07T07:05:40,12
"No way! You mean the same NYPD that had rampant sexual harassment happening between staff in their Special Victims Unit, a unit dedicated to sex crimes? That NYPD? Say it ain't so!  The same NYPD that tried to put fake terrorists spies in mosques in NYC and the imams in those mosques reported those fake terrorist spies to the authorities?   They can't, and won't, do anything right, ever.",canzicrans,2025-05-07T07:55:12,5

Here is some more information about the NYPD commissioner who handed over a sealed arrest of a Palestinian.     https://forward.com/fast-forward/676945/jessica-tisch-jewish-nypd/     Reminds me of this   https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/24/us/michigan-palestine-graffiti-university   Some info on the Michigan AG   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Nessel,therapistofcats,2025-05-07T06:53:44,1
Why did someone not hear legally risking arrest by participating in street protests? Why did the Arab American community her mother  is a part of support Trump over Harris? Why would someone filing for permanent residence take legal advice from their college instead of the immigration attorney they presumably hired?

Cops jerking eachother off is not news. Like interjurisdictional handies aren’t every day but they arent special… just like using the left hand.,enonmouse,2025-05-07T08:02:08,0
Incorrect. Under NY State laws these records are suppose to be sealed and not shared. The fact this law wasn't followed is what the article is about. The fascist who are sending our neighbors to death camps don't need you to make bad guesses as to why their crimes are legal.,zach_doesnt_care,2025-05-07T05:47:34,20
"Maybe in non-sanctuary cities, but NYC is a sanctuary city.  NYC policies restrict information-sharing w ICE or federal authorities.  That is the reason for the inquiry into the 'appropriateness' of this action.  Obviously there's a concern about Mayor Adams public bribery by Trump.  Adam's court charges will be re-instated any time Trump is unsatisfied with his conduct.  So far, this woman - 32-yo Leqaa Kordia, a New Jersey resident held at TX detention center - has been cleared for release on bond, but the AG is appealing it, so keeping her in ""detention"".  All this for participating in a Columbia U protest.  INSANE.",XSinTrick6666,2025-05-07T05:54:29,9
">The New York Police Department is investigating why officers gave U.S. authorities the sealed arrest record of a New Jersey woman who was detained at a protest last year — information that immigration officials are now using to seek her deportation.  It's not exactly a shock. This is the same group  where one of them punched a judge in the throat, laughed afterwards, and there were absolutely no repercussions.",superanth,2025-05-07T07:01:50,17
