Their agenda is more important than their constituents.   Period.,CouchCorrespondent,2025-04-27T08:39:40,144
They are listening to their constituents. It’s just that voters stopped being their constituents a long time ago,creddittor216,2025-04-27T08:41:04,65
"Our local/district representative is a real turd. She removed herself and her address from all of the public search sites, but I found a press release where she mentioned her kids names (who are adults) we were able to find her address by looking up her kids names in public registries.  When we flyer for issues in our area, we flyer our neighborhood (we also work with adjacent neighborhoods too), and also her specific street which is like 4 miles away (our district is huge).  She was beyond piiiiiised that we managed to flyer as far as her street (we flyered maybe a square mile and change, but not as far as her. Just her street). She did a zoom town hall and started yelling in anger about the flyers when someone brought up the issues. Someone had to cut her off. It was absolutely fucking wonderful.",fluteofski-,2025-04-27T10:33:19,39

"Every single one of these Republican Congress people are complicit, lying, oath-breaking, cowards. Every. Single. One.   It’s a shame this article didn’t call out Thom Tillis who also refuses to answer his phone, return calls, or hold town halls. Let’s hope all these pricks end up seeing the inside of a jail cell for enabling this bullshit.",Dexx009,2025-04-27T10:34:55,16

I don’t see how these Republicans expect to sustain this for another 6 months without it washing them all away in the mid terms. Are they that loyal enough to screw themselves?  Cause that is very cultist behavior.,yorapissa,2025-04-27T21:58:18,1
"This is why everything that is going on (from protests to town halls to organizing) are important, because it makes it harder for Republicans to win in nexts year's *state* elections, which means Dems have a good chance of taking back the House and possibly the Senate.",atreeismissing,2025-04-28T00:00:04,1
Always has been. They’ve only maintained seats through gerrymandering and other restrictions of voters rights.   And straight up corruption. Thats been extremely helpful,beadzy,2025-04-27T13:04:52,32

I don't blame them. It is clear it is a working strategy. Why talk to your constituents when they will re-elect you no matter what? Most of these representatives are in safe districts with no fear of losing elections.,ThePhoenixXM,2025-04-27T11:43:18,3
"It is such a shame that they will continue to be re-elected in safe districts even if they don't do their jobs or talk to their voters. In their eyes, ""Why talk to them when they are going to re-elect me in a landslide anyway?""",ThePhoenixXM,2025-04-27T11:45:33,1
