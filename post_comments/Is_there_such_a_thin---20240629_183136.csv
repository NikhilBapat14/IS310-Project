"> He said even if a President dies the last day of his term and the VP is sworn in as President, that person cannot serve 2 terms of their own because it would exceed the 8 year limit.  Your teacher is wrong.  The [22nd Amendment](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Twenty-second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) makes this very clear.  >No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.   To put it in more layman's terms, no one can be elected more than twice.  However, if a VP were to have acted as President (either the death of the President or the 25th amendment) for more than two years, they can only be elected one more time.  Just to keep the math a bit more simple, let's assume 360 day years.  If the President dies on day 721, the VP will finish out that term (just under another two years) and can run for re-election twice.  If the President dies on day 720, the VP can finish out that term, but only run for re-election once.  >If a sitting President wins re-election and then dies before he/she is sworn in for their second term, does the VP (who I assume would be immediately sworn in) also get sworn in as President for what would have been the dead President's second term?  Here this goes to the [20th Amendment](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Twentieth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution), Section 3.  >If, at the time fixed for the beginning of the term of the President, the President-elect shall have died, the Vice President-elect shall become President.  In this case, back to the larger question, the VP would serve more than two years of a term and could be re-elected only one time.  ETA:  >I'd also be interested to know whether these answers are any different in the case of resignation (e.g. a President unable to continue due to a medical diagnosis. In the TV show The West Wing, POTUS had MS, if his condition deteriorated enough he would not have been able to finish his term).  Nope.  Its all just about that ""more than two years"".  If Biden were abducted by aliens tomorrow, Harris would become President and could be elected to two more terms because she hasn't served for more than two years of Biden's (nominal) term.",AuditorTux,2024-06-29T18:35:59,3
"I knew Mr. Medved wasn't an expert on laws governing term limits, but he was off by 2 years. Wow. In fairness, a teacher saying ""I don't know the answer"" to a classroom of teenagers probably would have made his job even more hellish.  Thank you for the clear answer. It's comforting to know this isn't one of the gray areas.",Almost_Anything333,2024-06-29T18:57:04,1
