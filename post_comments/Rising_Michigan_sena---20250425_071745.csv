"Slotkin’s plan coincides with the rise of the ""dark woke"" rebrand embraced by some ""resistance"" Democrats, which encourages a crasser and more combative attitude towards Republicans.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-25T08:34:49,69
The lefties in the Michigan sub are melting down and calling for her to get primaried because she sounds a bit reasonable,Sneacler67,2025-04-25T12:08:47,37
"This approach never works because leftists call Democrats who want to do this ""racist"" and they immediately buckle.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-25T12:39:56,9
Wokeness from the past several years has told me the phrase “war plan” is macro-aggression and is an inappropriately violent term. For using it in public Slotkin should be fired and never be able to hold a job ever again.,777_heavy,2025-04-25T07:46:54,39
"""Retake the flag""  ...like the flag that was nowhere to be seen at their convention a few years back, until it was pointed out to them?",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-26T11:42:18,2

More calls from democrats for violent force to be used to overthrow the country because  they're not getting their way.,triggernaut,2025-04-25T07:22:04,11
"Probably referring to the pride flag, because we know how they really feel about Old Glory.",Ironman650,2025-04-25T07:53:27,-10
"Its just kinda hilarious the wokeys here in reddit think being \*even more\* marxist, even more woke and even more deranged about Trump its gonna help them in the next election, the country took a huge swing to the right in almost every demographic but you want to go in the other way? jeez.",Chikaze,2025-04-29T10:06:04,1
">more combative attitude towards Republicans.  They've rioted, blown stuff up, and killed people over the past several years. How can they be *more* combative?",sowellpatrol,2025-04-25T12:08:07,37
Her whole platform was we want to 'reach across the aisle'. The more i read that sub it feels like the people who voted for her didnt do any research on her and just voted because of the D next to her name.,darnfox,2025-04-30T09:31:56,1
"You should read the article if you're going to have a hot take about it, because it's obvious you didn't.  ""She is urging Democrats to ‘f---ing retake the flag’ with appeals to voters’ sense of patriotism, to adopt ‘the goddamn Alpha energy’ of Detroit Lions coach Dan Campbell and to embrace an ‘airing out’ of potential 2028 presidential candidates in a broadly contested primary,"" Politico correspondent Adam Wren wrote.",Trenticle,2025-04-25T07:51:17,68
"Buddy, this is the second time today you’re commenting and not reading the article.",medfunguy,2025-04-25T08:03:57,39
Basically by adopting the styles of AOC and Crockett.,purplebasterd,2025-04-25T14:58:12,12
It's what is between the lines that matters. Democrats are pushing for some unstable person to start the fight.,triggernaut,2025-04-25T08:08:12,-23
So just be dumber and louder?,Vectar7,2025-04-25T18:44:41,9
What is between the lines looks to me like she has common sense and understands the Dem messaging is alienating as hell. There are way worse examples of loud mouth politicians calling for violence than this.,Trenticle,2025-04-25T10:19:47,40
