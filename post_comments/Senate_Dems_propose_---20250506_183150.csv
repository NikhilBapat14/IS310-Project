"After abruptly pulling their support from what would have been the Senate‚Äôs first stablecoin regulatory bill, Senate Democrats announced Tuesday that they would introduce a new bill that would prevent federal officials and their families from issuing digital assets ‚Äì a bill directed at Donald Trump and his family‚Äôs current stablecoin and meme coin holdings.  ‚ÄúCurrently, people who wish to cultivate influence with the president can enrich him personally by buying cryptocurrency he owns or controls,‚Äù said Sen.

"""Ban"".  Or else what?  The 14th amendment prevents insurrectionists from holding office. Colorado's supreme court found Trump was one, but SCOTUS found that the amendment didn't say states could keep him off the ballot (and never rejected the finding of Colorado). There was no ""or else"", so it meant nothing.  The core constitution prevents foreign gifts of any kind - emoluments. There's no ""or else"" so it's dead text. His first term no one had standing to sue, so he got to do anything he wanted then and is now.   A 9-0 SCOTUS said to bring back KAG. He's just not. There was no ""or else"", so an innocent man is in a concentration camp with no recourse.  Unless the law says ""each individual violation of this, determined by any court, is entirely equivalent to in every way a successful impeachment vote; and all residents have standing to sue to check such a violation; and this law is not subject to Judicial review under the 10th amendment"", it's hot air.

Who said that? The Democrats should be hitting Trump constantly from all sides, and that includes legislation to stop the crap that Trump is doing. If they kept attacking, gumming up the works, them Trump will be so busy defending himself and trying to throw them off he won't be able to do as much, which is what's important right now.  >   Fewer, but more focused efforts against Trump are the strategy they need to use.   Trying to find the ""perfect"" opportunity to take Trump down which never comes is how we got into this situation in the first place. There will never be a real chance to stop Trump if they just stand around waiting for that ""GOTCHA!"" moment that will never come.       What they need to do is keep impeaching him for every single impeachable offense he commits, get it all on the books and how the Republicans react to each one.
