"Well, I just don’t think I’d trust any democratic politician who thinks we can go back to business as usual. I think our constitution needs some major reforms after this episode and we shouldn’t just continue as if nothing ever happened. It’s clear now that the constitution is only a suggestion for the executive branch and that was never the intention.",JPenniman,2025-03-29T21:01:42,139
"I think you are putting way too much stock in the Abundance book. I can see you would like their vision to become the ruling paradigm of politics but, for various reasons, I have my doubts. I get that there has been a big splash for the book, but it is yet to be seen how much actual impact it will have. Don’t get me wrong, I understand why the book is of interest and many people want to know where things we headed. But your vision of the future seems to lean way too heavily on this one book and frankly…America doesn’t seem like a book reading nation at the moment.",notapoliticalalt,2025-03-29T21:40:55,21

"I still hold out hope that Trumpism without Trump is unlikely to succeed in 2028 and beyond. I may be naive, but I still think Trump is unique in several regards that will be hard for the GOP to replace.  There are a few factors about Trump that inform my opinion:  1. Trump was on the Apprentice for 14 seasons cos-playing as a successful and sort of normal businessman 2. Trump is authentic, and a true outsider. Sure, he is ten pounds of shit in a five pound bag, but his constant lying is part of his brand and his outrageous behavior was refreshing to some people who were sick of political double-speak. 3. Despite the above advantages, Trump has never been that popular. He won in 2016 because people gave him the benefit of the doubt and Hillary was a very weak candidate who ran a bad campaign. Trump won in 2024 because mostly because of voter's rage (and misplaced blame) over high inflation, and also because Biden didn't step down in time to allow for a proper Democratic primary. Basically he got lucky that the Democrats were even less popular than he was.  Can you think of anyone on the right who has sufficient name recognition, outsider status, and popularity and also has true MAGA credentials? Tucker Carlson? I doubt it. JD Vance? He has a *lot* of work to do.  I am not saying that the Republicans can't win in 2028, just that their candidate will likely be much less Trumpy in the general election.  On the Democratic side, I hope that the ""abundance agenda"" gets a fair hearing, but it seems like the AOC and Bernie wing is ascendant at the moment. I think running to the left of Kamala when the electorate has shifted right might be one of the few ways the Democrats could lose in 2028. What is needed is a less rapey version of Bill Clinton.",judge_mercer,2025-03-29T21:24:09,23

"It really depends on how the second Trump administration ends. If he keeps on banging on about tariffs the economic fallout will result in a lot of backlash but if Trump accepts nominal concessions in return and goes back to his first term strategy of shouting a lot but mostly just being hot air and the economy keeps on muddling along then we'll see cheap Trump knock-offs for decades like how we saw cheap Reagan knock-offs for decades.  On the left the current mainstream strategy of ""you'll vote for more Neo-liberalism because fuck you, what choice do you have the other side are fascists"" can't keep on going forever.

"I think the public will want a political system that they feel more. The past 40 years have been full of long term policies that have increased inequality and stalled the quality of life of most people, if not just the perception of the quality of life. I think the willingness of republicans to go along with an authoritarian outsider means they want non-political policy impacts on the country. They want executive orders, they want to feel that their leader is fighting for them. Long term regulation or deregulation is not felt as strongly as ICE raids or threats of foreign invasions.   So when MAGA gets us into a great depression, I believe the next political order will have to fight for the common person as well as implement long term policy positions like you are mentioning. We will need a New Deal 2.0 to rebuild the country. We need universal healthcare, maybe a jobs program since unemployment is going to go up. We will need a better social safetly net so people can feel that life is getting better and that their kids can have a better life.",Matt2_ASC,2025-03-31T15:37:37,2

As a republican I don't think the American foreign policy and free trade regime will go back.

But, are they greedy opportunistic authoritarian wannabes who want to basically put the now decaying Neoliberal poltiical order into steroids? Yes, which they are flailing miserably at. We need to keep in mind that the United States is a federal republic with democratic elements that basically has 50 countries that can govern themselves under one umbrella of constitutional rights. In fact, I think the MAGA and oligarchy world are overestimating their power by quite a bit.    History is a cycle, and we will get to a certain point where circumstances get dire enough to motivate more ordinary citizens to take power for themselves in both local and state governments; and be more actively engaged in our democratic-republican experiment. Each state, each locale serve as little tiny experiments eventually amounting to something national/federal.    When the excesses of a political order devolves into hardship and deep crisis for a country, what remains is a rebirth of new ideas that had been hiding in the throes of the previous political/historical cycle.

"If you're thinking democratic socialism  is what will get America out of it's mess, then I have a bridge to sell you. It's just not going to happen. I acknowledge that a number of policies from AOC and Sanders, like labor bargaining power and  political finance are necessary reforms to address inequality and regulatory capture. However,  a lot of the other policies in this ideology that leans too heavily on the public sector & taxypayer's money does not cover how government buracracy itself is getting in the way of innovation and supply of the things we want and need, like housing, more doctors, etc. There are areas where government excels and where the private sector excels. We cant just hamstring either one. There's a balance to be had here.    Also, if you actually read Abundance, they are not advocating for Reaganomics. Quite the opposite, actually. Let's say a Green New Deal does pass in its 100% entirety, its projects will merely be blocked by a vast network of government red tape from most states and locales. This book advocates for policiies that makes sure that government is able to do the thing it actually wants to , because now, the reality is that permitting laws, restrictive laws around patents & getting money to do research, zoning laws, parking minmums, etc. are albatrosses around our neck. And yes, there are times when governments needs to back off and private sector needs to do its thing to achieve the outcomes of abundance we want for government policies to be more effective in delivering change in people's lives.   Why do you think China, Taiwan, and Japan builds shit much faster than us and have longer lifespans? Their housing, infrastructure, and healthcare all have some kind private sector elements to it and loose government red tape to it to create a situation of abundance and effieciency whereby government can then better able to do its thing in providing enough of the goods for people.   They just get shit done faster. ",godlike_hikikomori,2025-03-30T17:22:38,-1
"I dont totally disagree with this, but I am just saying that the government needs to make it easier to actually produce more of the things we need for a better life, and that requires Gov'ts own bureaucratic trappings to get out of the way, most of which were well intentioned but had unintended consequences. Executive orders are usually easily quagmired in litigations and buracracy across many states, so they are effectively useless in most cases even with a favorable US Supreme Court. It will take a combination of local, state, and federal leadership both the hands of the people themselves & their leaders to amount to something nationally. I dont agree with the ""Great Man"" theory of history and politics with respect to a modern interconnected world where most countries are heterogenous and democractic. One person or leader alone cannot pass 100 percent of their agenda. To do that, they need 100% of the power which is impossible for a decentralized federal republic like ours.    The solutions of past eras become their own problems in future eras which require new sets of uniquely crafted solutions.  After that, whether housing, healthcare and technological innovation are more leaning towards public or private is up for debate. Im not here to debate with you whether this abundance and innovation should be led more by the government or private sector, but one thing's certain, government red tape is hampering both the government itself and industry as well. The most successful countries( Japan, Germany, Norway, Sweden, and even China) in ensuring abundance and prosperity have been those that are more concerned with outcomes than bureaucratic process, and utilize both private and public solutions to address issues with labor equity, housing affordability, and infrastructure development. ",godlike_hikikomori,2025-03-31T15:47:13,1

"This story of solving the country’s problems by “streamlining the government “ is a scam. That is what DOGE is selling.   “Supply side” promotes the idea that capitalism will save us, even though it never has. I won’t be obedient to any philosophy of economics, not capitalism, not socialism. But at least the latter has some redeeming attributes, unlike modern capitalism, which has been a flagrant scam, distorting the concept of free markets to supplant them with seller’s markets.  The last person to try to sell me on this was claiming the same old zoning changes to benefit developers would bring down housing costs, despite decades of accommodations for developers that have never done anything to benefit renters in my city.  When I pointed this out they tried to spin a bunch of jargon about how even though prices went up, they still went down.   The other person I saw railing against government red tape last was Elon Musk pretending “impact studies” meant predicting how likely falling rockets were to strike sea life.   I went to the abundance network’s website and they were making comparisons about the building of the Golden Gate Bridge versus the building of bike lanes today. I did the research and checked out those claims. They were false, comparing just the construction of the former to the entire planning process of the latter.   Why did they need to lie about that I wonder? Could it be that many of us were there for the process of bike lanes getting installed in our cities and it wasn’t nearly so hard as the Abundance Network claims?  The whole branding this as “abundance” is suspicious. Why does it need a barely related euphemistic name I wonder?  This narrative of “big government” and “red tape” being the source of our problems is false. Yes, permitting times and costs have gone up because society has become aware of the effort necessary to protect the environment, not just on a global scale, but also on a local scale to preserve the natural beauty and wonder of the places where we live.   Around here developers would love to cut down more of our woodlands so they can build more luxury housing, while telling us marginal costs will bring cost down, even as costs rise and they reduce our quality of life. They’d love to remove offsets so they can market greater square footage, leaving people have to live next to urban foot traffic. Meanwhile pedestrians get to walk by walls instead of shrubs and flowers.   For my city I will support a mix of market based and socialist solutions that are specific and backed by organizations held accountable to ensuring the benefits are as claimed. I will oppose the same old empty promises that never pan out.   The time for evaluating the effectiveness and necessity of federal regulations and local ordinances is after we have fought much more pressing battles such as liberating the housing stock and fixing the tax code.   (PS I’m going to go read this book you all keeping pushing, just so I know the specifics when you pretend that the book has all the solutions, if only we would read it.

So just like a building demolished, you don’t even know what the clean up job will look like until the dust settles. Given the current actions, we an only see dust. That’s why Congress is basically sitting still doing nothing. Once the dust settles, a clean up/reorg plan will have to be devised, and then we’ll see the success or failure if that operation. Until we can see success in the horizon, it’s smarter for the GOP to stay quiet. And if all we see is failure in the horizon, then it’ll once again be a race for Democrats to lose.

I don't see MAGA and oligarchy world having their way in what is essentially a country with 50 self governing states but bound by constitutional rights.    I see everyday people  and leaders alike in state and local governments putting a check on the federal shitshow. The elections are run by states, not the federal government. Each state, each locale was meant to be tiny experiments of republican democracy all eventually amounting to federal change. During times of immense hardship and crisis, the people are usually driven to action to take power themselves.    History works in cycles. In the throes of this cycle, new rebirth of ideas and a synthesis of them will emerge, however way they will manifest. But, I am banking on some kind of syncretic supply side progressive order taking shape sometime in the 2030s. The school of thought is only just emerging and being put to use by people who are either in power in state or local governments or by those seeking to take power themselves at lower levels of government.",godlike_hikikomori,2025-03-29T19:27:52,-25

I see, from my experience, many people actively wanting to change things in their own states and even local town councils to push for change with respect to zoning laws in order to get more affordable housing built.    I believe your fear, while understandable, has been perpetrated by the media itself in order to flood the zone and sensationalize the true power of MAGA and oligarchs which is weaker than it appears.

It remains to be seen in the next 5-10 years, but the optimistic history buff in me says Americans will get through this period and onto the next era and more stable new political order. The fact remains that only a citizens' politics will defear MAGA and big money politics, but it has to start at the local and state levels.    The beauty of a decentralized federal system is that in a huge diverse country like ours, federalism is the best system for its citizens to both adapt and push back. The way Americans got out of the last Gilded age, especially in an era of extraordinary cynicism and disenfrancishment like the current crisis era of this historical cycle, many people in many states made sure they used their collective power in experimenting with solutions. You see, each of our states and counties are meant to serve as little tiny experiments of democracy within a federal republican structure. Solutions are produced in each state, eventually conglomerating towards a syncretic model nationally.   I know that in  the modern age of linear/tug of war views in history we tend to see progress as just that, linear, tug of war with one destination against injustice.

"If you do plan to complete the book, then I hope you don't find reading the book a waste of time, considering where you lay in the political spectrum. But, I just want to say that, often times, the solutions of a previous era like the ones pioneered by FDR and New Deal liberals & leftover progressives from after the Gilded Age, which are heavily advocated by Bernie & AOC,often leads to its own excesses that become the problem themselves. History often works in cycles.  That's why we had Neoliberalism, but it also had devolved into its own problems. I dont think either of us are old enough to understand just how prosperous the economic conditions were in the 80s, 90s and very early 2000s, provided if one had a decent job. But, Neoliberalism now has become the victim of its own successes from a bygone age. We can't go back to neoliberalism and we cant go back to old school New Deal progressivism entirely either. There needs to be something completely new that addresses the problems of the now and future in the coming decades. Call it whatever you want, but I do like the sound of an pro growth abundance economy with a dash of labor progressivism added in the mix. That is the kind of world that I believe we should live in so that government's capacity to actually be able to provide for its people and deliver on its promises becomes a reality. But, we also can't hamstring the private sector either and potentially overburden taxpayers.   Also, a lot of the zoning changes done in coastal states now are actually just milquetoast and does not actually go far enough. Part of the impetus is just macroeconomics of things like lumber and manpower being harder to come by in a turbulent world, but a lot of it has to do with an entire array of litigative network of local and state regulations concerning building codes and parking minimums that make it harder for government to provide housing to people.

"> This was likely to happen as expected, because these folks are not US citizens who are not bound by our Constitutional rights.  ""Don't worry, it is not fascism"" he says as he upends centuries of understanding of constitutional rights and denies them to tens of millions of people. Once you've decided to strip rights from one population, what stops you from doing this again for the next group? And the next?",UncleMeat11,2025-03-30T08:49:39,19
"What did you vote for, then? Or rather, who? Because you seem to be downplaying everything that's going on with the guise of ""the system will kick in and stop them before it's too late"". They ARE the system, and everything is orchestrated.  Sounds to me like you're ashamed of your own vote and are trying to tell yourself it's not as bad as it actually is.",slawcat,2025-03-29T20:15:46,11
"Germany is a federal republic, but I am also familiar with the US . Most states' funds are coming from a few states like California or Texas. All other states need extra funds from the federal state. They are all welfare queens and are broke the second the extra funds stop.  The federal state would be in big trouble without California, so no chance for independence. The degree of organisation is extremely low and no similar to other OECD states. Social media AND all other media are all under the control of Trump or oligarchs afraid of Trump. I would love to give you a light at the end of the tunnel, I see no light. It will be so much worse, so I hope you ditch your false hope and  let's face the facts.  If you want help to build up some kind of opposition, realistically, in your circle of friends and in your neighbourhood, I would help with knowledge. If you think it is not the time for it, I would help in a year, in two years or in ten years. Save my address, just in case: nils.rudnick@mail.de",nick5erd,2025-03-29T20:01:42,5
">""\[putting\] corporate ownership into the hands of workers through internal democratic systems""  It quite literally just means to force companies above a certain size threshold into co-ops. That wasn't a platitude. It was just the definition. It's perfectly doable, only with the ""break away from corporate influence"" part.   >""\[trotting\] the fucking globe to seize the fruits of our country's labor that those billionaires stole over the years""   What is insane about this? We already have a global minimum tax rate for corporations. It's a jump to go to the next G20 with plans to help each other enforce their tax laws?   The jump from what we have now to what I'm proposing is miniscule compared to something like the New Deal. I don't know if it's just that the rhetoric I'm using scares you or what.  What I'm proposing really just gets the US to some parity with many European countries.",BRAINSPLATTER16,2025-03-31T01:06:11,2
