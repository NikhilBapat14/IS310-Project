Trump is the leader Democratic Party,” the vice president told Baier. “Because they’re just against everything that he does.”  >Any time Donald Trump does anything, [Democrats] have this emotional response — they have to be against it.”   >”They don’t have real leadership,” Vance argued.   > I think that’s why I’m not too concerned about 2028, because if I wake up in a fantasy world where the Democrats actually have constructive ideas about how to govern this country, that’ll actually be a good thing,  but in the world that we actually live in, where they’re just anti-Trump about everything, the politics of 2028 will take care of themselves,” he explained.",Goosedukee,2025-05-05T17:33:09,1
