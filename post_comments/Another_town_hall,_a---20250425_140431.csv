"Small respect to Chuck Grassley for actually holding town halls in the first place, most Republicans nationwide don’t have the balls to get yelled at like this 91-year old man does",No_Biscotti_7110,2025-04-25T14:18:02,12

Grassley can show up and turn his hearing aids off when the crowds start yelling.,finsane86,2025-04-25T14:30:11,3

Isn't he like 90? He probably doesn't remember actually doing the town halls the moment they're over,Djbearjew,2025-04-25T14:10:30,19
Tons are doing town halls. Though at the same times tons are also being cowards. And Chuck does listen. Politicians do listen ? It’s just they know they have a coalition  of voters who elect them who they cater to more. Happens everywhere. ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-04-25T14:11:23,-2
