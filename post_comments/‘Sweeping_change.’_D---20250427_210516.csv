"Definitely a sweeping change... an awful, catastrophic sweeping change.",StrangerFew2424,2025-04-27T21:07:30,18
"Trump supporters just think fast action means he's ""getting stuff done"" and they don't care at all about what the actions are nor have the interest and objectivity to actually research it beyond the dopamine rush bubble they're in from being lied to by Fox News telling then what they want to hear.   Action does not mean good. It takes slow methodical thoughtful care to build services, policies, institutions, and laws that benefit the greater whole of society.   Anyone can take a wrecking ball to it quickly. Sure, that's change. That doesn't mean it was at all good change.",JournalistRecent1230,2025-04-27T21:19:42,15
"General theme of the article is that Trump’s actions have not been helpful to them, but they all support Trump. They didn’t support Harris and/or wanted a change from the status quo. Which echos that the Democratic Party needs to change its tactics if it wants to win.  The sad part is how they are deluding themselves. “I was frustrated that my food was taking too long to cook, so I rushed it, and now my food is burnt. But at least I have my food, which was better than waiting!”",Initial-Toe-9512,2025-04-27T22:11:20,8
"""He ruined my business, what an asshole. And the economy is in shambles!!! But I'd vote for him again, he's doing a pretty good job.""  It's really pretty wild how well MAGA managed to brainwash the general American public so easily while simultaneously being corny, incompetent and lame.",OklahomaBri,2025-04-28T06:39:57,3

Yeah. That’s why the “he’s done more than any president!” argument they all make doesn’t make sense. Doing a bunch of stupid or damaging or harmful stuff but really quickly doesn’t mean any of it was good or worthwhile. They don’t understand what you’re saying and how true it is,Lostsock1995,2025-04-27T21:27:02,9
It's hard to care what the actions are when you have a 4th grade reading level and no concrete understanding of history or how our government is even supposed to work.,OklahomaBri,2025-04-28T06:45:47,1
Even a mixed reaction is a victory when trying to turn people away from a cult.,ItsJustForMyOwnKicks,2025-04-27T21:43:48,3
"Yeah, 1000 artists carefully and SLOWLY crafting paintings, pottery, China over 250 years.  MAGA sees that and thinks it's woke democrats not getting anything done.   Then Trump comes along and smashes it all with a baseball bat, lights the paintings on fire in the span of an hour it's all destroyed and MAGA is all ""he's getting stuff done!""",JournalistRecent1230,2025-04-28T01:23:00,2
