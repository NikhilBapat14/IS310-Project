"Medicaid/Medicare Social Security Defense  Those are the big ones. Good luck touching any of that.

"After a frenzied week of small group meetings, leadership listening sessions and private committee discussions, [House Republicans are still grappling with core disagreements](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/02/politics/house-republicans-cuts-trump?utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit) over how they will extract $1.5 trillion in savings over the next decade. Questions over how to overhaul Medicaid and which tax provisions to pay for are front and center and the divides are still so entrenched that GOP members and aides aren’t ready to begin hearings next week on key elements of the bill.  To sum it up, one GOP member close to the talks told CNN when asked about Medicaid negotiations, “we’re not in a good spot, but we’re gonna get there.”  Asked about tax negotiations, “we’re not in a good spot, but we’re gonna get there,” they repeated.  The reality of what $1.5 trillion in cuts actually looks like and the very real impact they could have on constituents is beginning to take hold in the House GOP conference. It’s making rank-and-file members – especially swing-district members – incredibly nervous that moving ahead with them could hand Democrats a messaging playbook for 2026 that will be hard to combat.",cnn,2025-05-02T16:47:12,4

"Because republicans are rich. They often come from generational wealth, went to ivy league schools. Got into politics where they have no oversight on insider trading, accept gifts, donations, and get promised million dollar lobbyist jobs after they get out of politics.   They're obsessed with making THEMSELVES richer and consolidating their power to make themselves even more money.   They basically operate like a mafia at this point. Things ""stay in the family"" they make shady ""backroom handshakes"", they scheme and plot, use PR stunts to put up a front that they're ""legitimate politicians"", and then use their power to protect their own from any investigation, oversight, or consequences.   They're a cabal of very privileged corrupt sycophantic people who use religious views and manufactured outrage to manipulate voters into supporting them all to distract from their money grubbing corrupt policies and tactics.",JournalistRecent1230,2025-05-02T17:56:15,8

"Conservatism is rooted in the belief that humanity is inherently unequal. Those who have money have it because they are a shark amidst minnows; they deserve their place on the proverbial food chain.  Take for example someone like Elon Musk. In their eyes, he doesn’t have half a trillion dollar net worth because unmitigated capitalism allows for wanton exploitation of the working class. He has it because he as a person is simply worth more than the rest of us. He deserves it. Same for Bezos; do you want to live in a world without Amazon? He *deserves* to be a shark, and we *deserve* to be minnows.   In that worldview, everyone has their natural place, and the money flows exclusively in the way nature dictates. Through that perspective, the idea that we should strive towards a more equal society isn’t just an unrealistic fantasy, it’s starkly against the natural order. A more equal society, to them, is inhuman.   This ideology (conservatism) goes way back, at least to the French Revolution. It’s fucked, but it’s nothing new.  The clarity comes when you understand that it’s not just sharks who have this worldview. Minnows do too, and most of them don’t believe they’ll ever be sharks.",Advanced-Ad-4462,2025-05-02T20:33:23,1
