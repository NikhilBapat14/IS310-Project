RFK will not get additives out of food.  The food industry will make sure of that.  The interference into their profit margins will not be allowed.  RFK will cause people to die because of his tinfoil hat theories about vaccines.  Those deaths will be allowed.,Rude-Strawberry-6360,2025-05-06T18:20:33,20

"I'm enjoying this part of the administration play out.  If there's one thing I can find common ground with RFK on, it's that the US allows food manufacturers to put insane things in food, that the rest of the world doesn't allow.  But all those ""regulations"" the rest of the world has are evidence of marxist socialist radical government agendas right??  So RFK has to INCREASE REGULATIONS on an industry to do something that's just logical.  Watching with interest when it adds to cost and things aren't as red!",Virtual-Squirrel-725,2025-05-06T18:14:50,11

Increased food safety/regulation enforcement seems incredibly unlikely under this admin:  https://www.thedailybeast.com/fda-plans-to-end-most-of-its-food-safety-inspections/,sub-in-seattle,2025-05-06T19:22:07,4
Most of those differences are just semantics(ie red dye 40 vs E129) or straight up protectionism(ie chlorinated chicken) rather than actual safety issues.,ZozicGaming,2025-05-06T20:13:24,1
"This is this timeline in a nutshell. Who ever thought eliminating food safety testing would not only happen, but get buried by the media so that only a small number of highly engaged people know about it? It‘s so crass.",MrsACT,2025-05-06T23:33:25,2
