At this point the entire legal team should be just sanctioned until they come up with legitimate arguments.,thieh,2025-04-22T15:07:46,30
"The judge should just say ""I order you to do everything in your power to get him back and I want receipts of said efforts.""  There, no more supposed confusion.",NoPomegranate4794,2025-04-22T15:15:06,14
"Ummmm, from what i understood we are paying well Salvador for their services, therefore THEY are employees. We tell them what to do, they do it. Claiming he can't just show up and get the guy released is absolute bullshit.",SatoriFound70,2025-04-22T15:33:55,8
"No, Cheeto. You *enforce* the law. The court says what the law is. Of course, a fine patriot like yourself already knows that, right?",barneyrubbble,2025-04-22T15:52:53,3
"I can imagine a judge, nonetheless Supreme Court justices, love hearing that what they said was not actually what they said.",bridgeofdicks,2025-04-22T19:36:05,2
"Even if you give them their definition of facilitate they are, literally, by their own definition in violation of the order. You could nail them for contempt on that alone.",Professional-Buy2970,2025-04-23T05:12:00,1
"And if they fail to do so, they should be reported to the bar association to ascertain whether their license to practice remains valid.",gradientz,2025-04-22T15:13:05,17
I am almost of the opinion that all these lawyers making these bogus claims should just be disbarred. Isn't that what these things are for?,ibeerianhamhock,2025-04-22T15:40:17,10
"There's not even that wiggle room.  They said facilitate and effucate.  Facillitate means to make easier.  Effucate means, ""Do this thing absolutely""   Effucate means that the court absolutely ordered him straight up to do it.",CT_Phipps-Author,2025-04-22T15:18:02,14
Yep. And the response that Bukele gave when asked if he could return him was just idiotic.,Powerful_Artist,2025-04-22T15:37:16,2
"To hear him talk, he is the world‘s greatest negotiator.",Constant-Notice849,2025-04-22T19:23:17,1
"Well, the bar association has to hold separate hearings for that.  the judge can sanction but not disbar.    Judges can only refer people to the bar associations.",thieh,2025-04-22T15:46:10,7
"Yeah, I agree but I'm sick and tired of the ""but what does facilitate mean?"" Debate as if it's some kind of philosophical question.   It's like the people who try to debate math. It's math, 4+4 = 8, it will always equal 8, the answer is not up for debate.",NoPomegranate4794,2025-04-22T15:26:50,7
“BiG WoRds!” says the faux populists as per the usual…  https://youtu.be/sLlsgBLevpg?si=xvPTIuyIvEvNsmo3,oliversurpless,2025-04-22T15:36:53,3
"The ""effectuate"" terminology was removed after it got to the supreme court as it went further than judicial powers allow. An order to ""effectuate"" his release could demand military action if, for instance, El Salvadore refuses to return him.",LangyMD,2025-04-22T19:11:59,1
Grrrr... if only we hadn't gutted education and people still had the ability to think critically.,SatoriFound70,2025-04-22T15:46:21,1
"Why?  The Orange Shitgibbon himself shitted out on (un)truth.social yesterday, that trials weren't needed ( for potential deportees)  because they would take too much time.  The Bar Association should accept that ""logic"".",Belgarablue,2025-04-22T16:56:56,2
That makes sense. Not my field. Wouldn't pretend to know.,ibeerianhamhock,2025-04-22T15:47:47,1
"This are the same people who think ""preserve protect and defend the constitution"" means physically protecting a piece of paper, but not to support it.",Udjet,2025-04-22T16:12:19,5
4+4 is easy. But a lot of people still refuse to believe that 196-182*0.5=7!!,LordGothington,2025-04-22T15:43:26,1
"At the very least, they should stop any transfer of funding to El Salvador.",JakeConhale,2025-04-23T02:11:37,1
"Well, the problem is that the guy who posted that isn't licensed.",thieh,2025-04-22T18:12:47,1
"Um..... I get your point, but by order of operations... that's actually 105.",JakeConhale,2025-04-23T02:10:47,2
"Your math checks out, but I am not wrong. The answer is definitely [7!!](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=7%21%21)",LordGothington,2025-04-23T10:53:28,1
