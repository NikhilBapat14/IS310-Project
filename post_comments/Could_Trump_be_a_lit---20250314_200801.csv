"""Litmus Test"" implies some sort of non-destructive small scale test - sort of like dipping your toe in the water.

"> For example, imagine he imprisons someone for their speech without evidence that it violates any legal statute. If such an action is deemed unconstitutional by the courts, it could demonstrate that our system remains robust, capable of upholding checks and balances and maintaining an even separation of powers.  There is an element missing from your description, I think.  To demonstrate that our system is robust, the court orders against the executive branch would have to be obeyed, or obedience compelled through enforcement.  Right now the executive branch is ignoring several court orders made against it, and the US Marshals Service is shirking its duty to enforce those orders.  Moreover, the White House Press Secretary announced in a press release today that the administration does not recognize the judiciary's authority to curb executive power.  I think the scenario you are suggesting is in fact occurring, and demonstrating that our system of checks and balances is ***not*** robust.",ttkciar,2025-03-15T00:13:35,61

"Your question is implying that he hasn’t already tested the Constitution and the American System as a whole. He, and the Republican Party have, and it failed. In his first term alone, he has done so many corrupt things that in a functioning system with three seperate branches, checks and balances, and a functioning 3rd estate, he would’ve been removed from office. Even ignoring that, this term he’s already done illegal actions such as ignored congress’ power of the purse. Then there’s hundreds of other things such as ignoring background checks for appointees, firing without cause, weaponizing the DOJ, which is supposed to work for the people, not the President. So I can’t see how someone can say could it be, it was / is and it has failed. The question is how much will it fail?

"Trump is a symptom of where we stand as a country. It is the effect of a decades long propaganda campaign against the American people by those who hold the most wealth. Look at the dislocation of reality that right wing media has been pushing, even before Fox landed.  Consider also the stagnation of wages going all the way back to the 70s. This has been a long term plan to move away from a populace based government to one that is ruled by the oligarchs. They’ve only now stepped into the light in recent years but they’ve always been there using the media to form consensus.  Half of this country has lived in a profoundly overwhelming bubble and every person they respect is also enveloped by said bubble. And worst of all, they have come to associate their very identities with the “truths” this bubble embodies. This country needs to go through mass deprogramming and learn how to track down and analyze original sources so they no longer need rely on anyone else’s take on the state of things. This isn’t about the left wing being right. It’s about searching for the truth and not merely stopping when you like the answer. But digging to the bottom of the information pile to be certain that one knows what is going on.  The evidence is all out there, but one must be willing to really look and be willing to be wrong. And our responsibility is to follow up on that evidence and try to put aside our prejudices and see what it is actually there.  My younger years were spent as a staunch conservative but the more I sought the truth the more I found I was being lied to. I’m now 52 and have spent roughly the last 30 years digging to better understand the truth of the world I live in. I was fortunate to escape the bubble because I ended up living outside of the US long enough for the fog to clear. It’s not easy being confronted with evidence that all you thought was true has been a mirage created by people who don’t have your best interests at heart. But it is worth the effort to KNOW what is true.",mjmcaulay,2025-03-15T17:11:50,2

My dude you are 7 weeks late to the conversation.  Trump is already taking unconstitutional actions.    We already know that the constitution does not provide a defense against a rogue president when the presidents party controls congress and the Supreme Court. The main vulnerability to the constitution was having elected officials ignore their oaths.    Since the beginning the American system only worked because elected officials honored their oaths and those who didn’t were held accountable by their peers.  The two party system breaks the system of checks and balances.,JDogg126,2025-03-15T00:50:15,2

Unfortunately, corrupt ideologues don't have an honest justice setting. This court doesn't fairly call balls and strikes. They throw games.  And Congress...? Well, Congress has ignored who they work for for so long that we can't expect anything out of them.

Litmus test is the wrong term.  But Trump certainly highlights the vulnerabilities of the US system.  The constitution is not as robust as many Americans would like to think.    The president has far too much power while the nature of the presidency encourages the Congress to reduce checks and balances rather than enforce them.  The last line of defense is federalism.  It will be up to the blue and purple states to erect barriers.  It wouldn't hurt if a red state or two joined in.,I405CA,2025-03-15T14:36:38,1

" OP’s point is that Trump could be testing the foundation and the durability of American government. And this sort of makes sense, considering laws were changed so he could be prosecuted for something he otherwise wouldn’t have been. If he can pass and do all sorts of crazy stuff, he’s exposing that the system is already broken, not that HE broke it. Meaning, anyone can do what he’s doing.   If court orders are being ignored, other parts or branches of the government should be acting to combat that. If they’re not, this proves again that the system is already broken (by the ppl currently working in the government and/or the government structure itself) and our system doesn’t actually hold up when truly challenged. A system that only works when everyone follows the longstanding rules is not a real system.   If a president is elected and does things that are against the law, it should be very easy to get them out.  Edited*",ladylavender007,2025-03-16T08:20:31,1
"Politicians have always treated it like guidelines. The only difference is trump isn't hiding he's attacking it.   When oboma took down occupy Wallstreet, he didn't say there was limits to speech, he accused them of violence but stressed peaceful protest was ok.   When Bush Jr got the patriot act, he said you have a 4th amendment right, he was just going after ""terrorists"" .   When biden went after gaza orotestors with the goon squad, he did stress nonviolent prptest was ok. Sure the goonsquad ignored that. But the perception was only violent ones were shut down.   Same with other draconian pandemic decisions by governors during the pandemic. Limiting the right to assembly or freedom of movement or government medical decisions was to protect and as soon as the pandemic calmed down they'd end.   It was at least portrayed as something else.   Trunp flat out says protesting genocide in Gaza is supporting terrorism and is a danger to the country.  So the goonsquad shows up, but it doesn't pretend.   Trunp just fires people who won't take the knee right away, instead of winning them over or slowly replacing them.   Trump has the raids claiming fir border safety and acting like the 4th amendment diesnt exist for noncitizens. Bidens guys at least got warrants, so did oboma. Even though the end result is the same.   I could go on, but it's not so much he's testing it,  but rather he's not pretending he's following it.

"The UK does have a constitution it's just not codified like in most countries.  In the UK system a PM can be removed by a simple majority vote in the House of Commons. They can also in practice be removed by their own party if they lose their confidence.

The European Convention on Human Rights is also a factor external to the UK (though the first act of any dictator would almost certainly be to withdraw from the Convention).  While it's never officially talked about it's widely believed that the monarch is also a last ditch check on the rise of a dictator.   The existence of a monarch robs Prime Ministers of the grand trappings of leadership which should help prevent the rise of a dictator in the first place e.g. the military etc swear oaths to an impartial monarch rather than to obey a politician.

"No doubt presidents of both parties have expanded presidential power for decades now.  The scale and speed at which Trump is consuming the power of the legislative branch is orders of magnitude higher than any president before him, in a way that is actually staggering.

Trump has signed 89 in under two months.  Unlike pausing student loan debts, a huge portion of these actions are made with the explicit intention that they will be impossible to reverse even after they are found unconstitutional by courts.
