It's a pretty simple thing to look up. I didn't learn finance in school and I know how it works. People are just intellectually lazy. If they really cared they'd do a 2 second Google search.,veksone,2025-04-24T15:38:50,0
Go to the Walmart subreddit and search for Union. You’ll see a bunch of ~~bootlickers~~ employees stating how a Union would make things awful for everyone,KrookedDoesStuff,2025-04-24T15:11:15,4
"I support Unions for everything except law enforcement, or at least that they shouldnt pay for criminal defense or for personal lawsuits. It gives them extrajudicial power as they aren't bargaining with someone else, they are bargaining with themselves to get members out of criminal and civil liability for anything.   If they stuck to bargaining for pay and benefits, that would be great, but they spend far more money defending lawsuits, criminal cases and lobbying against police reform.",crappleIcrap,2025-04-25T07:53:08,2

"Your experience is the exception, not the rule.  Most people don’t get that binder.  Ever.  But your point is also well-made - even if the education for personal finances existed in a majority of HS, most people couldn’t retain it long-term anyway.",Rebal771,2025-04-24T10:22:55,3
"Valid, but also most things you learn in school aren't *immediately* applicable to your daily life outside of the context of school itself at that age. They still teach people about, let's say, trigonometry or the fall of the Roman empire or chemical reactions, even though that stuff probably isn't going to be used or retained by a good portion of the class. Exposure is important, even if expertise isn't immediately gained.  Personal finance information actually will be used by most of them, whether they like it or not. Eventually you have a job and a paycheck, expenses, debts, etc. Being previously exposed to the idea that tax brackets exist and how they work is pretty relevant to most adults. If even 30% of the class retains that basic understanding, that's a hell of a lot more adults who aren't completely baffled by the concept.",omfghi2u,2025-04-24T10:55:05,2

Fractional reserve banking is a complicated subject. ,DanteInferior,2025-04-24T21:52:09,1
">even if the education for personal finances existed in a majority of HS, most people couldn’t retain it long-term anyway.  Last I read a few years back, something like over 75% of schools have required financial literacy cirricula. In the three states I've lived in, it has been a required course for over 25 years now.  But yes, most people actually do get a financial literacy course and then retain zero of it.  Most don't even remember taking the class even though they did take it.  This is not a failure on the school system.  It's just that it's not age / experience appropriate in high school.",ATotalCassegrain,2025-04-24T10:59:17,1
"I agree.  I'm just pointing out that nearly everyone gets a financial literacy class.  It's been required in most states for decades now.  And very few retain even the knowledge that they even took the class, lol.  I didn't remember my financial literacy class and cursed the lack of having one until I came across the binder in a move and then remembered.  >If even 30% of the class retains that basic understanding, that's a hell of a lot more adults who aren't completely baffled by the concept.  I'd put it at probably low single digit percentages.  I work with accountants with degrees and only some of them understand marginal tax rates -- they just know ""put number in tool, use number that comes out"" when figuring out tax burdens.  And they had multiple years of schooling for their job, and they didn't retain basic information.  Very few people lock in much more practical knowledge than what is explicitly needed for them to survive in the world.  I mean in various subs the #1 asked question is about simple addition or division asking for help.  Particularly medicine subs -- ""it says to not take more than 800mg per day.  Is 5 200mg doses more than that?!?!"" is a pretty common riff on like the majority of questions.",ATotalCassegrain,2025-04-24T11:13:03,1

"Ok:  >a bondholder invests $20,000, called face value or principal, into a 10-year government bond with a 10% annual coupon; the government would pay the bondholder 10% interest ($2000 in this case) each year and repay the $20,000 original face value at the date of maturity (i.e. after 10 years).

"MMT only claims states can never be insolvent, not that debt doesn’t exist. Literally from the article you’ve never read:  >MMT says that as long as demand exists for the issuer's currency, whether the bond holder is foreign or not, governments can never be insolvent when the debt obligations are in their own currency; this is because the government is not constrained in creating its own fiat currency (although the bond holder may affect the exchange rate by converting to local currency).
