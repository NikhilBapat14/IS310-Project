The issue is the Trump administration will stop or greatly curtail the Marketplace tax credits for people. This administration will throw millions off of healthcare who have otherwise had it through the Marketplace.,Brundleflyftw,2025-05-07T15:52:26,98

"Aetna is the sole insurance company on my state's Marketplace that covers the best hospital network in my area. I've been on Marketplace coverage since I went on disability from my job, and chose Aetna specifically because I wanted to see doctors in that network. Now, I have to hope they can negotiate coverage from another carrier next year, because the only other options are Catholic hospital networks, and being a trans person that means that I'd have severely-limited care options. It really sucks.",platinumarks,2025-05-07T18:35:01,25

"Health insurance shedding business because ultimately the deep secret of health insurance is that it’s not that profitable. Companies have been exiting FFS and individual plans; exiting the ACA is just another pruning of the low profit/no profit business. There is a reason Walgreens wrote off the VillageMD acquisition. The current market, is really only profitable if a company has a Medicare Advantage plan that is essentially a government subsidy.   If the government gets serious about MA fraud, waste, and abuse, the whole system could come crashing down.",idoma21,2025-05-08T00:18:09,0

It's biggest fault is that Medicaid expansion was not made mandatory, leaving a lot of low-wage workers in red States without insurance, just out of spite since the federal government was picking up the tab.

Then they're going to say that they're 100% for the entire agenda, the only thing they want to change is the thing that affects them.
