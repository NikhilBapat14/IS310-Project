"During Covid conservatives were unwilling to tolerate even the tiniest inconvenience 'for the greater good of the American public'. No masks, no vaccines, no social distancing, no crowd restrictions, no remote work. Not a single inconvenience or personal sacrifice. Then they spent the entire Biden administration complaining about inflation. My god the price of gas and eggs! Dems are so elite and out of touch with real Americans who are so economically anxious.   And now they are going to quietly accept paying 20%... 50%... 200% more for nearly everything?   They really are suckers.",Toribor,2025-04-30T17:06:47,25

It sounds like the dolls are likely to cost roughly 15 times as much if what used to get you thirty dolls now gets you two. That’s not a couple of bucks and also how much does he think dolls cost?,not_productive1,2025-04-30T17:09:53,5

So Trump is saying - let’s take toys and probably take candy from babies because - he is a baby and needs to make sure he is a billionaire and his friends are billionaires.

His entire enterprise is built on discretional spending. He's probably more vulnerable to a recession than most of us. And the banks aren't going to lend to anyone so his preferred means of purchasing new assets is right out.,1877KlownsForKids,2025-04-30T15:57:37,14
