">""It just shouldn't be this hard to get by in the richest, most powerful country in the world.   I started a conversation with Michigan voters a decade ago when I started my career in public service.   >""When you talk to them, they're talking about feeling like they are stuck on the outer edge of an economy that they're about to get kicked out of. They're worried about whether or not they're able to afford groceries, whether or not their kid's school is preparing them for a future that they want. Whether or not they can afford health care and not get smacked in the face with a huge debt simply because they went and saw a doctor when they got sick.   >""That has caused so much pain in our state, and the people who've exploited that pain to get elected, people like Donald Trump and Elon Musk who came in on his coattails, they've just made it worse. They're exploiting that pain to deliver for people like them: billionaires, oligarchs, corporate CEOs.  Adding to that is polls show voters no longer believe Democrats are the party most likely to look after ""people like me"":  [Democrats’ Own Polling Reveals No One Trusts Them](https://newrepublic.com/post/192589/democrat-poll-brutal-verdict-no-one-trusts-them)  It is long past time for Democrats to win back the base of working voters who put them in power in the first place, instead of constant catering to wealthy donors and to upperclass suburban republicans.  This is why so many working voters either stay home, or worse yet -- vote for Trump.  It's time for Democrats to return to their blue collar roots.",ThistleroseTea,2025-04-25T09:39:17,5
"The media has both sides things and legitimized formerly far fringe positions that efforts to make inroads have been and will continue to be blunted.  Media in the U.S. will not hold anyone accountable unless it can drive engagement and ad revenue.  When someone doesn’t trust you, you generally want to engage with them and help show them that you deserve their trust.    But what conservative and mainstream media is good at is undermine, whataboutism, and both sidesing narratives for profit.  It undercuts the typical approach to regaining trust.  So how else to fix?  That’s the problem Democrats must face.  And I’m not sure how they go about fixing it.  Saying that they’re actually on the side of workers has not and will not change this.  Actions are hard when you’re in the minority and undercut at every opportunity.  It’s a tough situation.",teamdiabetes11,2025-04-25T10:08:09,2
"This certainly didn't help either:  >The working class saw Clinton’s support of Nafta, which cut most tariffs between US, Mexico and Canada, as ‘a betrayal’  ....   >Nafta acted like a slow-motion poison for Democrats. After Congress ratified it in 1993, year by year more factories closed and more jobs disappeared as manufacturers moved operations to Mexico to take advantage of that country’s lower wages.       >The Economic Policy Institute, a progressive thinktank, estimates that the US lost 682,000 jobs due to Nafta, which largely eliminated tariffs between the US, Mexico and Canada.""       https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/28/nafta-us-jobs-harris-democrats-trump  Hey but it was great for the corporate donors.  Then, when Obama was elected into office in 2008, instead of helping Americans who were losing their homes, he focused on bailouts for corporations. [10 million Americans lost their homes as a result](https://archive.md/fvdc5).  Democrats have four decades of betrayal to working class Americans to make up for.  It will be very good news if they have finally decided it's time to focus on those most in need of help, instead of focusing on helping the upper middle classes, private equity, and corporations.   It's not a matter of ""better messaging,"" its a matter of simply finally doing the right thing. Until now, all they cared about was if they could say ""*hey be grateful because the other guy is worse*.""",ThistleroseTea,2025-04-25T11:58:38,-1
