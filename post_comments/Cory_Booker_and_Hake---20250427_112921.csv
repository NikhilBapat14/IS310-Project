"***From Rolling Stone’s Peter Wade:***  Sen. Cory Booker and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries are holding a livestreamed sit-in on the Capitol steps in protest of a forthcoming Republican budget they say will gut Medicaid — a federal and state program that helps to cover medical costs for people with limited income as well as disabled children and adults.  The sit-in began at sunrise, shortly after 6 a.m., and Booker and Jeffries promised to stay for “a good number of hours.”  Read more: [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/booker-jeffries-capitol-sit-in-medicaid-1235326047/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/booker-jeffries-capitol-sit-in-medicaid-1235326047/)",rollingstone,2025-04-27T11:38:08,2

"So they move to censor Al Green and bully Justice Dems internally for speaking out, and completely deny AOC any kind of support but somehow you want us to think this is authentic? Jeffries is still hitting up the same funding base as the people who sponsored Trump’s inauguration, and Booker who immediately voted for Trump’s appointee after his filibuster performance while also funded by pharma?  Like, genuinely, we might not have another election and they’re still fooling around with the same playbook? The democrats utterly need to be primary at every single level of government or otherwise we’ll never get out of this nightmare.",Irisvirus,2025-04-27T22:22:48,1

"This would actually mean something if they did a sit-in on a week day where it stood the changes of actually disrupting something. It would have a greater impact if they actually organized people and brought hundreds or even thousands to the sit-in.  This is no different from a politician livestreaming from home and bringing on a few guests throughout the stream. My prediction is that they'll be out there for the day, collect the political points they think they need to stay in office, and then go home to pat themselves on the back for al their hard work defending America.  I'm glad to see them do something, but this isn't nearly enough nor effective enough. Real action is what AOC and Bernie are doing by holding rallies and town halls. It's drafting legislation, it's building and communicating a plan and a vision. What's the Dems' plan? I certainly haven't seen it, aside from James Carville's suggestion to roll over and play dead. A strategy effectively modeled  by Chuck Schumer.",thepryz,2025-04-27T12:21:53,19

Not vote for cabinet members or judges. Filibuster when it matters instead of approving Trump’s nominees. Do anything to slow or stop Trump from making any progress.  Not sit on the sidelines with this performative bullshit.,ArcadeKingpin,2025-04-27T14:16:11,23

Like filibustering things instead of doing it for them sake of breaking a record. Why couldn’t he have slowed the confirmation of dr oz? How many cabinet members did he vote for? Booker is aiding this administration and his protests are just for show.,ArcadeKingpin,2025-04-27T21:55:53,2
"Also, Van Hollen using his power as a US Congressman to demand El Salvador show Garcia was alive and ultimately getting him transferred to a better prison (though ideally he would have came home) is another example of a Democrat doing something. Walz is also holding town halls across red districts and reaching out to the American public.",MasterofPandas1,2025-04-27T14:14:25,16

Don’t just roll over and say “well he can do it anyway, might as well make it all look legitimate”.  Even a cabinet entirely confirmed on a 1 vote majority would be better than just giving up.",midnightcaptain,2025-04-27T16:50:54,8
