"The No Rogue Rulings Act (HR 1526), would limit national injunctions made against Trump’s Executive Orders by Lower Courts.  These so called “Activist Judges” are merely just doing their job, it’s Trump’s administration that are the ones complaining about their unconstitutional EO’s being halted.  It’s passed House and now sits in the Senate, awaiting a future vote.  It can be stopped by a Dem Filibuster or managing to convince GOP Senators to oppose it.  For those who wish to act against this awful piece of legislation, I’d advise using 5calls to contact your Senator as they have a handy script to use:  https://5calls.org/issue/federal-court-attack-no-rogue-rulings-act/  If you have a Senator of the GOP/MAGA variety, I have something to read which can help with that.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Defeat_Project_2025/comments/1gwmdkz/comment/lyalhaj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button  Adjust some things to fit the nature of this bill!",Anoth3rDude,2025-04-26T13:42:09,28
"Lower courts cannot save the rule of law. Only SCOTUS can. And SCOTUS was the one who ended the rule of law in 2024. And in the end if POTUS refuses to abide by the rule of law restored by SCOTUS, it is the US military that decides whether there is a rule of law or not. That is why POTUS is trying to clean house in the military as well.",JoostvanderLeij,2025-04-26T17:58:23,7

"That makes sense.   If the lower courts are causing trouble for Trump it's perfectly logical for him to get rid of them.  After all, no one can stand up to him.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-26T15:42:55,1
