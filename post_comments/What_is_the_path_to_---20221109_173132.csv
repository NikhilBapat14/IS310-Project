"> Effectively everybody has access to the internet  Well, first of all, this is not true--at least if you're talking about the US. Slightly over 90% of the US has access to the internet. There are still rural parts of the country where internet access is hard to come by, and plenty of rural/older voters who don't think it's worth it.  But the bigger problem with internet elections isn't the access, and it isn't the technology. The technology exists. Other countries, like Estonia, use it. It's that Americans don't have faith in it.  The US has a long history of (very real) voter suppression in, for example, the Jim Crow South. In recent years, the Republican Party's insistence on pushing widespread ""voter fraud"" conspiracy theories has vastly diminished trust in our election results--both on the part of Republican voters who believe these theories, and Democratic voters who believe these kinds of theories are a cover for the Republicans' own malfeasance. Add in the fact that we know Russia and other antagonistic countries are using the internet to try and influence our election results--and that they've hacked into our voting systems in the past--and it gets very hard to see how you get Americans to have faith in this kind of voting system. We like to see the paper trail. We like that that our voting system is so decentralized, because that means you at least have to physically in the room to mess with the results.",anneoftheisland,2022-11-11T12:43:52,1
"Not even close to happening.  Twitter canâ€™t even secure blue check marks.  Remember, computers are designed to be manipulated.  We just call it programming.",[deleted],2022-11-11T17:13:28,1
"Do you want a process that we can be certain of, full of process and deliberation and constant checks, or do you want less accuracy and faster results? Americans have raised a huge stink about election security in the last few elections, so we're making sure things are secure. Time is a good thing. It means there's more eyes, more effort, and more deliberation going into getting the results.  Internet elections are probably never going to happen. We just can't be sure they are secure. Every effort made to make the internet secure has failed, somewhat, and that's kind of the whole point of the internet in the first place. It trades security and verification and deliberation for speed and access, which in almost every situation besides elections is a pretty good trade. But elections? Hell no.  I mean, encrypted things are stolen every day. Blockchain has been hacked. It's just not going to happen, not when paper and people are so much easier to verify.",mormagils,2022-11-14T10:04:15,1
