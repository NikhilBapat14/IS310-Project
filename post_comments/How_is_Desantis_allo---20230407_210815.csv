"Well, because there's really not a good mechanism to hold him to account. Disney could sue and argue that his actions violate their free speech and due process rights. However, I could easily see DeSantis arguing that Disney does not have a constitutional right to have its own municipal government in Florida.   DeSantis didn't incarcerate anybody without a trial, and he isn't torturing anybody at Disney, and he didn't impose any criminal penalties on Disney because of their speech. All he did was sign an Act of the Florida Legislature that altered how a Floridian political subdivision operated. Which, he would argue, is his  constitutional right as the elected governor of Florida under the 10th amendment, and the Florida state constitution.  At least, that's how I would imagine his legal defense would go.",PaleontologistOk7794,2023-04-16T16:55:00,3
Disney argued that the land they occupy in Florida is owned by England and is not subject to the constitution. Disney is also a non- profit organization. Look it up.,Odd-Sir-990,2023-11-19T22:58:32,1
"And DeSantis would likely win with that defense.  The problem here is broadly speaking, retaliating just for political reasons isn't necessarily legal or illegal. If DeSantis issued a special fine or tax on Disney just because they were opposed to him, that would be obviously illegal. But DeSantis does have a right to make laws that don't treat Disney special if he wants. It may be stupid, vindictive, and amateurish, but none of that is prohibited by law.   Essentially, retaliating for political purposes is more of a political situation than a legal one, assuming it's done well. And political stuff is remedied by elections.",mormagils,2023-04-17T09:34:40,3
