You don’t say?  If this is true then why are they giving Trump so much latitude? Right now he’s enacted policies that anyone being honest with themselves know have cross into unchecked territory.

This isn’t true.,ElderSmackJack,2025-05-08T07:32:48,-3
Ffs. The judges interpret what an official action is.  Not the president. It’s immunity if and only if the sc says x y or z was “an official action”. And defying the sc cannot by definition be an official action. The sc is not stupid tho they sure give that impression sometimes ,sir_racho,2025-05-08T06:37:35,5
Realizing? He clearly knows what he has been doing. It was always part of the plan.,Intelligent_Teach247,2025-05-08T07:00:05,1
The immunity extends to “official actions” and the sc remains fully in control of deciding if x y or z was an “official action”. The immunity is under the full control of the sc and always will be. If the exec decides to ignore the sc and go lawless well thet is another matter and nothing means anything anymore except guns and blood ,sir_racho,2025-05-08T06:40:30,1
