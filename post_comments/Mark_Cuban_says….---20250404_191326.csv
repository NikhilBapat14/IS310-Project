Yeah this is about to get a lot worse. The market nose diving is just the immediate reaction. Wait until the tariffs actually kick in and inflation/prices go crazy. Of course I‚Äôm preaching to the choir here. The people who need to hear this are unable to process the information.,dart51984,2025-04-04T19:39:29,190

Musk is so much worse than he appears. His grandfather was run out of canada in the 40s for running a nazi affiliated organization ‚Äúthe technocracy movement‚Äù.

"Small businesses play a key role in promoting the ""E"" in DEI, which stands for ""Equity."" Small businesses level the playing field, enabling people of diverse backgrounds to escape corporations by starting their own business, ensuring everyone has a fair shot. They also provide employees with access to training, mentorship, and growth opportunities.. Small businesses usually have strong ties to their communities, so they can actively support local initiatives and engage with diverse groups to help tackle systemic inequities. Additionally, many small businesses implement supplier diversity programs, sourcing from minority- and women-owned businesses, which helps promote economic equity in the broader supply chain. Small businesses don‚Äôt just improve their own communities, they help build a more equitable society overall.",2GR84H8,2025-04-05T13:05:51,2
