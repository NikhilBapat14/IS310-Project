Carville on Fox... so TWO reasons to ignore this,mahamoti,2025-05-03T15:32:49,23
James Carville yells at cloud.,Ok_Mongoose1426,2025-05-03T15:28:13,11
This guy just needs to shut up and go away. He's pointless.,Hot_Historian7387,2025-05-03T15:23:36,16
So Republicans just lie with no consequences?,justalittlebear01,2025-05-03T15:18:45,25
"By the way, have you guys looked at X/Twitter recently? Holy effing smokes, the white supremacists are literally in control there. The N word is now a completely acceptable word to say thanks to the Shiloh lady drama/grift... things are out of control. They are literally turning back the clock for every day that passes, it's scary how emboldened the MAGA base is over there now.",douglasfalk92,2025-05-03T15:36:19,12
"What credibility do you speak of, Mr. Carville?",11bulletcatcher,2025-05-03T15:45:33,12
Dont need to lie. Need to purge the liars from the democrat party and be a party of fiery and unrelenting truth.¬†,Oldschoolhype2,2025-05-03T15:29:52,8
James Carville needs to piss off and stick to what he's good at: Shilling for the Cocktail Party.,TheRustFactory,2025-05-03T15:31:47,3
"The mistaken cajun is speaking, everyone stop what you're doing and listen closely.",Impossible-Owl-66,2025-05-03T15:33:29,3
I see that Carville found a friendly outlet in FOX NEWS telling democrats how to be democrats on a daily basis...,Agnos,2025-05-03T15:28:26,6
You don‚Äôt even need to lie you just need to educate the electorate on basics.¬†  When Trump says other people pay tariffs you just need billboards explaining what a tariff is and how it gets paid¬†,DataDude00,2025-05-03T16:08:05,2
"Unfortunately, he's right.¬†",StrangerFew2424,2025-05-03T15:42:24,3
The one thing you have to admit is that tRump lies on a daily basis.  Republicans can accept his lies but that does not make those words true.,jpcapone,2025-05-03T15:33:28,1
"This is why *The 11th Commandment* is so essential to Republicans, and it's that pledge of party loyalty Trump has leveraged into a loyalist culture focus on his personality.",MoogProg,2025-05-03T15:35:42,1
I am curious of what precious credibility social currency he speaks of!,SkullArcherx33,2025-05-03T16:13:55,1
why this guy speak shit on dems on fox entertaiment?,Mr_strelac,2025-05-03T23:30:55,1
This mendacious clown should lead by example.,fafalone,2025-05-04T02:09:01,1
How ironic that a man who lacks credibility speaks of it as if he's an expert on the matter.,LordSiravant,2025-05-03T19:03:02,1
True they can't lie like the Republicans do. They have to find different ways of lying. For example when you told us more than 60 days ago that the Trump administration would collapse in 60 days.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-03T15:46:39,-5
When have Dems ever told the truth,That-Resort2078,2025-05-03T15:27:47,-12
Obama lied about healthcare and it worked.,Jolly-Star-9897,2025-05-03T15:25:37,-14
He‚Äôs looking/sounding no more ‚Äúfit‚Äù these days than Biden.,Straight-Treacle-630,2025-05-03T17:10:15,1
Largely yes. We‚Äôre in an age where the literal inmates are running the prison.,Lumpy-Loan-7350,2025-05-03T15:21:22,26
"Anecdotally, my parents are R.  Constantly lie about everything.  Live in complete denial and have failed upwards since the 80s.",SimplicityGardner,2025-05-03T15:21:46,13
Lol where have you been the last decade? Yes! Just look at all the stupid shit said on Fox News or posted on Truth Social. MAGA will eat that shit up as 100% gospel facts be damned.,dr_z0idberg_md,2025-05-03T15:39:23,8
"'We have traded an era in which corruption was widespread but provoked outrage and consequences when it was discovered for an age in which corruption is condemned but seen as inevitable, legal, and even constitutional.'",monkeywithgun,2025-05-03T15:36:53,4
Yes. Because it's on their voters to hold them accountable...   Those same voters keep voting them in because they don't give a shit as long as they hurt who they want hurt.,ImmoKnight,2025-05-03T16:22:05,2
Yup.,brocht,2025-05-03T15:57:30,1
Republicans are good at lying. The democrats are not good at propaganda. Being weak is worse than the loss of credibility. How would the democrat party going to fight for a democracy if they are spineless like Republican-Russia Congress.,kupomu27,2025-05-03T15:46:06,0
Many of us have more sense than to have accounts on X.¬†¬†¬†,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-03T15:48:08,2
Zactly - truth and facts have a distinct liberal bias.,CockBrother,2025-05-03T15:52:48,1
good thing we have Linda McMahon as Secretary of Education now. Her experience with pro wrestling is sure to help define programs that will help the electorate become more knowledgeable in the basics!  /s,edmerx54,2025-05-03T16:43:52,1
"They obviously don't have to be true. They don't even have to make sense. As long as they provide the right vibe to his followers, that's all that matters.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-03T15:48:59,1
They need to fight the Republican party. It is not about credibility. It is that they are weak and spineless. That is why he wrong. üòÇ,kupomu27,2025-05-03T15:48:06,2
Comparing lies to murder and people to pollical parties  Republicans would be serial killers and Democrats would be casual murderers.    You guys take ideology over fact.,jpcapone,2025-05-03T15:35:47,7
You are lying now,bmcgee,2025-05-03T15:29:35,14
he also lied about the NSA spying on Americans,box-cable,2025-05-03T15:32:38,-7
"Oh i know, I was just stating aloud in disgust.",justalittlebear01,2025-05-03T15:44:58,2
"Maybe you should, for opposition research purposes. No but, I get what you mean. It's smart to stay away for your mental health but I just have to voice just how awful it has gotten, all of these big accounts with hundreds of thousands of followers proudly ""reclaiming"" the n-word... it's a sign of things to come: this is just the beginning, things will get worse before it gets better (if it ever will be...?)",douglasfalk92,2025-05-03T15:51:29,3
While I understand what you're trying to suggest with this comment but hiding your head in the sand and staying only in the reddit echo chamber is just as bad in the other direction.,RipComfortable7989,2025-05-03T17:19:07,1
Theoretically nobody should know the Democrats better than Carville. So presumably he already knew that they were weak and spineless and he took that into account in his prediction.¬†   Carville is a washed-up has-been who is not worth listening to. Kind of like the Democratic Party.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-03T15:53:55,-2
I'm well aware of the crazies that are supporting Trump. I don't need to see it in real time on social media.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-03T17:53:32,2
"Yeah, the progressive democrats are only fighters that we have. They keep telling us that the democratic government is collapsing but act like normal.",kupomu27,2025-05-03T15:55:16,2
