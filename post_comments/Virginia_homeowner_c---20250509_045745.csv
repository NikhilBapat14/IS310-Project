"So ""it's just a prank bro"" turns into a murder charge for defending your home against someone trying to break in, all because they claim they were filming a video for tiktok like that absolves them of trying to kick someone's front door in...",Suspicious-Sound-249,2025-05-09T05:05:34,893
Didn’t they try to kick in his door?  Play stupid games win stupid prizes. Drop all charges.,Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-05-09T05:54:38,485
"A reasonable person in their home upon seeing someone they do not know attempt to make entry into their home is well within their right to use whatever force they deem appropriate to deter the intruder.

"Your home does not end when you leave the walls of your house, it extends to the boundaries of your property.   Not all states recognize this unfortunately.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-09T06:31:05,239
"The story really didn’t give much info, but it sounds like the home owner came outside to confront them and just shot them. If they were trying to enter, that’s a different story. But in a lot of states, castle doctrine protections no longer apply when you actively leave the safety of your house.   That being said, you’ve got to be seriously brain damaged to bang on someone’s house and garage, especially at night. Really unfortunate. ",StuckInMyPants,2025-05-09T05:32:04,212
"I live in the county where this happened. Believe me, you don't want to mess around with people and their homes in the middle of the night. Everyone out here is pretty well armed. We have more and more nonsense and crime creeping down from northern VA and there's been more and more shootings here lately.",SpikeC51,2025-05-09T09:20:57,39
Kicking a door to my mind = kicking open a door.  At 3am or 3pm I’m going to respond to eliminate the threat.  Set this man free (assuming I understand the facts of the story).,Creeepy_Chris,2025-05-09T07:51:39,59

">One of Butler’s neighbors shared home surveillance footage with the outlet that shows the three teens going up to Butler’s home and not only ringing the doorbell but banging, kicking and slamming on a garage door.

"But does that give you the right to use deadly force to enforce those boundaries?  If the teens (as far as I'm aware, it hasn't been determined yet), were running away after being confronted, that doesn't bode well for a castle doctrine/self defense argument  If the teens were close to getting in, and stood their ground when confronted, Butler has a good argument  edit: he can claim that he feared for his life, and has no duty to retreat.  But if it is determined that they tried to leave after he came outside, his argument falls apart.  They would have no longer been an active threat",you_cant_prove_that,2025-05-09T09:05:47,-60
"Yeah, from my understanding of Castle Doctrine. The legality of shooting can get very murky if you take aggressive action, particularly if you leave your “castle.”   Besides the legality of the situation, it’s just not smart to leave the safety of your home to confront people you believe are breaking in.",Stea1thsniper32,2025-05-09T06:31:01,86
I’ve read the teen just banged on the door and then attempted to run away.  He was shot in the man’s yard.  Does not seem to be justifiable,cofcof420,2025-05-09T19:53:32,1

I thought it was a middle aged black dude who shot a kid im pretty sure is white but not entirely sure.   Idgaf if the homeowner is black white pink green yellow- he has a right to defend his home. If the homeowner is black and the dipshit dead kid white I dare say this would be a case of racism if they continue to pursue charges. People of all colors have a right to defend their property.,Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-05-09T08:26:32,143

"During my hand gun training for concealed carry, we got a big lecture from the RO about seeking cover, avoiding conflict, and de-escalating the situation.  Shooting someone should be a last resort.    He told us that the second you remove that gun from your holster and point it at another person your life will change forever, more than likely not in a good way, either.
