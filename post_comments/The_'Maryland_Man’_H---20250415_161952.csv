"The "" ~~Maryland~~ El Salvador man"" is in his home country of El Salvador, and will remain there forever. He is never coming back here, as this is not his home.  The administration should stop commenting on this nonsense story. Everything that needed to be said, has been said. They need to start loading up more flights and stop letting teary-eyed leftists delay their agenda. We had an election. The American people voted for mass deportations, it doesn't matter what the media thinks.",[deleted],2025-04-15T17:41:12,14
