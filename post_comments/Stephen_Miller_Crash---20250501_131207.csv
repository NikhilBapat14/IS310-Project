If you get a chance, look up the [American Factory ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=m36QeKOJ2Fc).

First, you need more than a ""concept of a plan,"" then you have to get permits to build, and constructing that manufacturing company will take many years and depending on how many corners you cut will determine that factor. Ad then after that you have to hire people. Because even if you want all automation and no people roles, you still have to hire people to manage things. And of course you have to pay them less, and they don't want to be paid less. I mean, I could go on forever.   Any of us who aren't MAGA obviously know this isn't feasible or realistic.

"I didn't say he had a micropenis, nor did I say that there is anything wrong with having a micropenis. I said he looked like one. That said, you might have something of a point that the comparison is an insult to micropenises everywhere.   Some of the best sex I've had was with a person who didn't even have a penis. ",JennJayBee,2025-05-01T20:19:24,1

">Even in reliably red states, the former president is not immune to attrition. Utah recorded an 8-point drop (from +21 to +13), and Idaho, for instance, dropped from +36 to +30, and Oklahoma fell from +31 to +26. Wyoming, where Trump still holds his highest net approval at +38, is down 6 points from January. Arkansas, Montana, and Kansas also saw 6-point declines, signaling that the erosion is nationwide—even in Republican strongholds.  In red states, he's still seen hugely positively.  +13?  +30?  In an election, that would be a landslide victory.  The few points on the polls isn't what you're claiming it is.  In swing states like Florida his approval has shifted from +8 to -1. Neutral.  He'd probably still retake Florida if we held the election next week.",meteoritegallery,2025-05-01T18:09:20,0
