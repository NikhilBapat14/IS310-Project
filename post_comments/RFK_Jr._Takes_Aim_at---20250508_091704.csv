"From Bloomberg News reporter [Gerry Smith](https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/ASEziLmpouc/gerry-smith):      Senior leaders at the US Food and Drug Administration began pushing [Moderna Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MRNA:US) and [Pfizer Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/PFE:US) to file for full, formal approval of their Covid vaccines for children last summer. The conversations gained urgency after President Donald Trump was reelected, and climbed higher when Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine critic, became the nation’s top health official.  It wasn’t enough. By the time the applications were in hand at the agency, FDA employee departures had begun, slowing the work, according to a person familiar with the process who wasn’t authorized to speak about it. They are still under review, as the number of political appointees who oppose the immunizations for children climbs.  Unlike adult vaccines, pediatric doses of the shots from Moderna and Pfizer were made available on an emergency basis that was granted during the pandemic. As the head of the Department of Health and Human Services, Kennedy has the power to revoke that access. Meanwhile, momentum is building to scale back the current recommendation that all children over six months old get immunized against the virus.  While the entire vaccine community is in turmoil, Covid shots are squarely in the administration’s crosshairs. Under Kennedy’s leadership, the FDA [delayed](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-25/novavax-falls-on-report-that-fda-wants-new-covid-vaccine-trial) full approval of [Novavax Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/NVAX:US)’s immunization, which is currently available for those 12 and older, and [shifted](https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/rfk-jr-bets-500-million-on-universal-vaccines-in-shift-from-covid-19-funding-0299d927) federal funding from Covid projects to research on other viruses.",bloomberg,2025-05-08T09:17:35,5
