"He projected perfection onto a terrible idea, and he's shocked that it turned out to be a terrible idea. These people live in imagination land, where they can imagine nonsense solutions to nonsense problems (like tariffs), and then are constantly confounded when they run into a brick wall in real life. Of course, then it's everyone else's fault lol.",Suedocode,2025-05-09T13:16:53,41

One time I listened to him just to see what he was about. I was expecting him to be some power-hungry but intelligent sociopath.  Nope. He's fucking stupid.,MWF123,2025-05-09T13:42:22,12

 Yarvin sees that this is going to end incredibly badly and destroy the reputations of everyone involved.   He's trying to get in front of it so people don't pay him a visit around Christmas once the excess companies bought runs out and the tariff prices and shortages really start kicking in.,Cassius23,2025-05-09T13:47:40,3

"That's why his ideas are such a joke. They all require pure perfection.  Like the idea of having an elected monarch would theoretically be good if an unnaturally perfect person existed.   Not advocating for removal of checks and balances but obviously that part of our system can get in the way of things being done.  So if you did have this perfect elected monarch, sure it would be great if they could push their agenda through...  Well yeah good luck finding that",ATLfalcons27,2025-05-09T13:20:02,15

Yarvin could have read the minutes of the Constitutional Convention and Common Sense to know why his perspective was already considered and tossed.   The benevolent dictator pretty much never happens.,TintedApostle,2025-05-09T13:30:01,14
"I agree 99%, but I don't like your last line for annoying reasons.  It is important to note that real world forces make this ""perfect monarch"" thing impossible because of how power is wielded by people. Even great monarchs struggled to keep their corrupt nobles in check.  The problem is that these MAGA folks don't recognize the real world dissonance of these ideas. You are daring them to go find a perfect person to serve as our perfect monarch. Well, they actually did set out to find their perfect monarch, _and they found one._ Reality denied them the answers they were looking for (because it doesn't exist), so they simply retreated into delusion to project perfection onto some vessel.  They found the nearest spray tanned turd with a big mouth, and then dropped to their knees to worship him. It's a pathetic display of small minded people. Needless to say, their solution is melting in the face of reality, and they're flailing to figure out whose fault it is. Not theirs of course; it's never their fault.  At the heart of all this recent strongman macho bullshit culture are small minded cowards that can't fathom their own failures.",Suedocode,2025-05-09T13:47:15,12

The last benevolent dictator was Cincinnatus.   Except in the Roman Republic the appointed dictator's power was limited to the problem the Senate appointed them to solve and there was a 6 month limitation.  Then came Sulla.,TintedApostle,2025-05-09T14:28:16,6
