"In theory yes, which is what makes the overturning of Roe v. Wade so terrifying. Without Roe, congress could institute a national abortion ban. Whether or not this is likely to happen is up to your own political views, but without federal legislation that codifies the right to an abortion into law, or a constitutional amendment that does so, it’s entirely possible. We’ve already seen conservative states pass their own incredibly restrictive abortion legislation.",mic_gstat,2024-08-02T21:59:09,1
"Possibly. You can take on this question a few different ways.  1. The federal government issues guidance that all federally funded hospitals are required to provide abortion care related to rape/incest/medical emergency. That would circumvent the states entirely since these hospitals fall under federal medical care requirements and this would be an extension of those requirements. ***(Think of it similarly to how a hospital is federally banned from denying treatment to a person unable to pay. A state banning care for the uninsured wouldn't go anywhere.)*** 2. The federal government passes a law banning the prosecution of an individual traveling between states to have an abortion. **Some states have suggested they'd prosecute a woman who travels out of state for an abortion.** In this scenario, the federal government would outline in federal law that traveling interstate for a medical treatment is a protected act federally and the states cannot prosecute someone for doing so. It's arguable states would not have jurisdiction in the first place to enforce such a law since the crime did not occur in state. 3. The federal government creates a universal federal medical license which supersedes all state level licenses. In this scenario, the federal government could grant themselves the power to issue medical licenses which would grant them oversee power to state level medical policies. In such a scenario, you could imagine a new wing of the Department of Health and Human Services creates a federal medical board which writes out federal guidelines for care. Part of this would include reproductive care. Considering congress has historically granted the federal government wide powers in medical care, this could possible stand to challenge in court. 4. The federal government repeals the Hyde Amendment (which bans federal taxes being used for abortion) and they use federal funds to create federally protected reproductive care facilities in all states. These facilities would be categorized similar to other federal buildings in that state laws would not be enforceable there and these states could operate under federal jurisdiction.  5. The federal government could pass a federal law establishing that medical privacy is a federally protected activity and define it in a way similar to how it was defined in Roe V. Wade understanding. I imagine it would be an amendment to HIPAA rules which would expand   The problem we have is the issue of whether a fetus is considered a being with civil rights has never been addressed by the courts. It's arguable that the courts MIGHT take that position but in a similar way that they define a comatose or legally dead person ***(without the ability to argue for themselves)*** still may have certain basic rights.  What the supreme court overturned was the argument that the 14th amendment included a right to privacy (which they historically included for the term Liberty) and that medical privacy rights were enshrined in the constitution as a consequence of privacy being a constitutional right. They covered it under medical privacy.  All of these scenarios are specific to whether the status quo of what a fetus is does not change federally. If the Supreme Court decides otherwise, this all goes out the window.",[deleted],2024-08-03T00:36:20,1
