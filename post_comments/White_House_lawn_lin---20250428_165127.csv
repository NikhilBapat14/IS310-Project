"The fact that a 34-time convicted felon is deporting ‚Äúcriminals‚Äù that have 33+ fewer convictions than he does to a concentration camp in El Salvador without the same due process privilege he was given, while simultaneously blanket-pardoning all the cop-assaulting convicted traitors involved in the Jan 6th insurrection is *all the evidence you need* to irrefutably prove that he is a racist fraud piece of shit that doesn‚Äôt give a single fuck about rule of law or anyone other than ‚Äúhis people.‚Äù  It‚Äôs all phony. It‚Äôs all smoke and mirrors. It‚Äôs all a grift. And it wouldn‚Äôt be possible without the support of millions of uneducated, phony ‚Äúchristian‚Äù ‚Äúpatriot‚Äù chumps that fall easily for the most obvious con in history because they‚Äôre dumb, racist, and/or so enamored by shiny gold things and their unattainable daydreams of being wealthy that they somehow think they‚Äôll get wealthier under the rule of the greediest most self-centered man alive.
