Thatâ€™s a lie. Some Democrats voted  to make it more difficult  for married women to vote. Last name has to be the same as your birth certificate.,bapeach-,2025-04-12T13:48:26,46

And 4 Democrats voted for this which is shameful.  Hope to hear about a primary effort for those 4 far right wing Democrats who want to suppress women from the right to vote,DimMak1,2025-04-12T14:51:28,8

"Trump is a demented and fucked up person. I cannot wait for 2026 and 2028 so we can finally put an end this his evil.  But please make your titles accurate; exaggerating to the point of lying hurts our cause and makes the voters we need to reach not trust us or take us seriously. What Trump is doing is evil, and he is without a doubt a monster. Iâ€™d argue he is already definitively the worst President in American history, so we donâ€™t need to exaggerate his evils because its already fucked up.",iusedtobekewl,2025-04-12T13:26:17,14

"America first agenda? By separating us from the free trade market America will become last with a huge economic disadvantage. China has cut us off.
