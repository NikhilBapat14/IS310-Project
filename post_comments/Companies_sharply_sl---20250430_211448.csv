"Probably due to all the economic catastrophes, I would imagine.",StoppableHulk,2025-04-30T21:43:05,16
"We're 19 days in to the 90 deals in 90 days and not only do we not have a single deal yet, but US companies are on hiring freezes and we're crash landing into a recession thanks to the GOP and Trump.   GOP had an opportunity to save face tonight with American citizens and vote against the ""Liberation Day"" tariffs, but the vote did not pass Senate thanks to them.",Financial-Special766,2025-04-30T21:56:13,13
Yet Trump just said that since he took office companies have committed to spending $8 trillion in investments to America.  Something isn't adding up!,InsideAside885,2025-04-30T21:19:37,6
It’s Biden’s fault - Trump.,Justthetippliz,2025-04-30T21:28:35,4
"The clouds are darkening and the tariff chickens are flying home to roost.   Trump is alreafy under water on the economy, and the pain has not even started yet.     Bankruptcy, layoffs, surging inflation, empty store shelves, interest rate increases--it's all coming. Imagine what the polls will look like in two months when the real pain starts to hit.   With Trump as the leader of their party, Republicans will fair about as well as Canadian Conservatives did on Monday.   Trump would and could have become a dictator, but happily he is too stupid and incompetent to even make a go of a casino, let alone a country.",Beantown-Jack,2025-04-30T21:46:22,5
"Damn it. As much as I hate the cPOTUS, I am not looking forward to this recession. ",accountabilitycounts,2025-04-30T21:18:05,2
"Companies are already going into freeze mode, waiting for more clarity on policy.  Of course since Trump is an erratic and impulsive dumbass this will never happen until we have a new president.",zubbs99,2025-05-01T02:17:17,2

GOP have a lot of financial blood on their hands now.,AdCharacter7966,2025-04-30T23:14:32,3
That is the line every MAGA will be spouting for the next four years. Worst depression since the 30s? Biden's fault and only Trump can save us!,Kid_Serious,2025-04-30T21:36:24,6
