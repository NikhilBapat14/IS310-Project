Resistance works.   Do not back down. Do not surrender to fascism.,act17,2025-04-25T10:29:02,290
"""Backing down"" is not good enough.  Every one of these fucking nazis needs to be held accountable before the law for what they are doing.  They are disappearing people without warrants, without due process. They are engaging in *kidnapping and human trafficking.*  They are fucking nazis and they need to be held accountable.",HerbaciousTea,2025-04-25T10:39:12,76
"I have such a hard time accepting good news these days. 😅 I feel like there's some kind of catch, or the news will change quickly.  But I do think public pressure matters. Media attention matters. Protests matter. We all need to do what we can to keep shining a spotlight on the trump admin's treatment of immigrants. If ICE can back down on this, they can back down in other ways. Let's keep the pressure on.",sachiprecious,2025-04-25T10:32:33,24

"We must think about fascism more like a creeping mold. If you fight back and spray one spot with bleach, it will die back. However, its a very wide mold and your spray bottle is very targeted, so you have to keep checking for progression in different places. That's why fighting back on every single front matters, and why each victory like this is a sign to keep going.  Fascism wins when people pre-comply. We are all aware of ""First they came for"", and that's why fighting for immigrants and students now is so important. We've already seen them try to move against judges today, but I have hope that as they continue to lose the immigrant related cases that their further efforts will fail spectacularly.",Orzorn,2025-04-25T10:36:47,111
Correct.  Now we must not forget that they are currently allowed to enter homes and further target minorities.  This is 1 win that will take up the news cycle amongst a dozen other further steps into Fascism,Ok-Permission-2687,2025-04-25T22:21:20,3

"Protests matter. They do. It may not feel or seem like it, and we are still early, but we must organize weekly. Judges are doing amazing work, and we must make it known that we appreciate their courage, we must keep being loud.  But, like you, I find it hard to accept good news. From the Article linked:  > “ICE is developing a policy that will provide a framework for SEVIS record terminations. Until such a policy is issued, the SEVIS records for plaintiff(s) in this case (and other similarly situated plaintiffs) will remain Active or shall be re-activated if not currently active and ICE will not modify the record solely based on the NCIC finding that resulted in the recent SEVIS record termination,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Carilli read from a written statement during a hearing in federal court in D.C.  They are pausing & reinstating, but are developing a clear policy to move forward with terminations. If I was someone in this situation, I wouldn't suddenly feel safe. They may still come for you after whatever bullshit policy is created.",CosmicLars,2025-04-25T10:56:22,11
"Maybe? I don't think they care if there's overcrowding, or if anyone dies in there.   But I don't think we're at the stage where they're just straight-up are executing people, yet.  Seriously, wtf is going on in this world? Only life we know of in the universe and we're here doing this shit. I hate it here.",KungFuSnafu,2025-04-25T11:18:38,14
"Good analogy. It's also why the rest of Timothy Snyder's rules are important. It's hard to catch everything, so only watch for fascism in institutions *you* care about. You need to be the one who cleans it.",svrtngr,2025-04-25T11:03:28,17
"Even Trump judges are ruling against them. They literally have no standing to say “such and such as going rogue.”   So they move on to fear, which only pisses everyone off more.",Mr_Horsejr,2025-04-25T16:01:05,5
Exactly.  While this is definitely better than before if you're a foreign student you can never feel safe because you can be swept up at any time.  If I were a foreign student I would not come to the US.  Period.,eskimospy212,2025-04-25T11:03:30,5
"Right, it also means we don't spread our attention spans too thin. You *cannot* react to everything, that's why fascists like to ""flood the zone"". Its their smoke screen.  If you remain vigilant in sectors you are knowledgeable and passionate about, you will be best poised to defend it. Its times like these that we must trust each other the most, because no one person is going to save us. Its going to take everybody pitching in for the institutions they care about.",Orzorn,2025-04-25T11:26:42,10
>If I were a foreign student I would not come to the US.  Period.  Same. Our reputation abroad has been totally shot and will naturally affect how willing tourists and foreign students are to come.,jayfeather31,2025-04-25T13:26:34,3
