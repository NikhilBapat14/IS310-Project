No. Bullshit. The real lesson is that they were discussing classified information on unapproved communications systems.,Ancient_Popcorn,2025-04-24T09:42:07,16
The security issues are evident.  But the main motivation is to avoid documenting what they are doing via official channels so that they can avoid accountability.  The Signal chats will disappear when Hegseth et. al. want them to.  Trump gave away intelligence to the Russians during his first term.  His main objection was that he was caught.,I405CA,2025-04-24T09:48:09,8

What?! This chowderhead Hegseth’s boss had intel that he lifted from the whitehouse strewn about his seaside estate. Let’s not act like this isn’t a Trump problem top to bottom.  Harris wouldn’t be having a signalgate or a HHS guided measles outbreak or a global tariff war right now.,LuvKrahft,2025-04-24T09:49:57,3
"The true lesson learned?  For most people, forks and knives are the crucial breakfast utensils. For Hegseth, it's a corkscrew.",TheRustFactory,2025-04-24T09:50:08,5
"Just an aside, but are we ever going to stop using the suffix ""gate"" on everything?    It's so lame.",Searchlights,2025-04-24T09:50:32,3
We've got an entire administration that is unqualified.  They've fired all the experienced security staff and cut what remains to a skeleton crew of lackeys.  The world is watching this shit show and the US government has been antagonizing other countries the whole time.,Accurate-Guava-3337,2025-04-24T09:51:26,3
"It wasn’t a “surveillance arms race”, it was incompetence. Stop rationalizing MAGA incompetence.",TrailerParkFrench,2025-04-24T10:19:52,3
"I'm pretty sure all our secrets were sold to Russia in the first Trump Presidency. That whole documents fiasco thing at Mar A Lago that went under the rug. If there were any left after that, the rest were sold soon after Trump took office the second time. So I guess it's just real time theft and open exposure we're down to now. If this whole thing doesn't end in Treason Sentencing and Restoration, then.. bye bye USA. :(",Skowlette,2025-04-24T09:50:47,2

"\> But to do so, they must first recognize the real problem with SignalGate: how exposed sensitive communications and private information have become for anyone reliant on a modern smartphone.  I am absolutely sure all of these people have been told about the dangers of what they were doing. This isn't a problem with lack of awareness. Here are the actual lessons:  1. Don't hire unserious people. An alcoholic talking head from Fox News is not a serious person.  2. If there are no penalties for doing the wrong thing, lazy/bad people will keep doing the wrong thing.  We are here because the only people who receive consequences for this kind of activity are the little people.",Simmery,2025-04-24T10:06:07,2
"The real lesson is that there is a *historic* level of incompetence among this regime. It defies reality.  The truth is that our greatest fear may not be slipping into dictatorship (we are already close) but just the complete collapse of the country and chaos that will ensue.  This regime is so incompetent and corrupt that it will manifest in every governmental organization, the military, everywhere. I think the regime will collapse eventually but not before bringing everything else down with it.",Thin_Ad_2046,2025-04-24T10:27:05,2

I'm waiting for the next headline:  >Scandal worsens as sources reveal Hegseth 'spoke openly about Yemen attack stregies' with 'Russian phone sex operator' while 'blacked out on Four Loko.',Tonsilith_Salsa,2025-04-24T13:41:51,1
"At any time in the last 200 years some meat shaft like hegseth could show up and blow it. We're supposed to have protection from meat shaft appointees by Congress. If we don't have protection from meatshaft defense secretaries, all your fancy surveillance toys can't save you.",butnek,2025-04-24T10:36:24,3
