"""The United States Holocaust Memorial Council was established by Congress in 1980 to lead the nation in commemorating the Holocaust and to raise private funds for and build the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Once the Museum opened in 1993, the Council became the governing board of trustees of the Museum, an independent establishment of the United States government operating as a public-private partnership that receives some federal funding to support operations of the Museum building.      The Council, which meets twice a year, consists of 55 members appointed by the president, as well as five members each from the Senate and House of Representatives and three ex-officio members from the Departments of Education, Interior, and State. Presidential appointments serve for a five-year term; 11 members’ terms expire each year.  Because of the large size of the Council, its work is done primarily through the committee structure. The Executive Committee, which acts on behalf of the Council in between Council meetings, meets four times a year.""  The museum has been running for 30 years, why is this even a thing?

Personally, the high road method has not been working out so well for the Democratic Party, but I do understand that need to show the American people “we are above the crazy” while Trump embraces it. Further more (unfortunately in my opinion) of the voting population, it’s was the voter’s choice.   My concern is Trump has absolutely thrown the baby out with the bath water and there won’t be a democratic republic left for any party and Trump really will try to make a kingship of sorts.

"To explain a little simpler for people who are seeing your comment:  Jews as a people have been around so long and in such tight communities that they have evolved to be an ethnicity. Ashkenazi Jews (Eastern European for the last 1000+ years) share common genetic markers and traits - like hair type, facial feaures, and even unique hereditary diseases. You could recognize someone as a member of that ethnic group even if that person grew up as a Buddhist in Thailand.  And there would be people who would HATE that person simply for carrying those genes. That is anti-Semitism.    The venn diagram of religious Jews and ethnic Jews has a huge amount of overlap. But there are people on both sides who don't qualify as the other.    Me, personally... I am as Ashkenazi Jewish as it gets. My dad did a DNA test and got 96% Ashkenazi Jew. I grew up a loosely religious-practicing Jew but have since turned against ALL organized religion. I also strongly oppose the idea of religious states. But people would still hate me and want me dead anyway, even if they shared my beliefs, because my genes are what they are. THAT is anti-Semitism.

"You don't want to hear what we have to say because you made up our opinion of the second amendment? (I own a gun)    Every time I talk y'all call me a pedophile or a groomer even though I've only talked to one minor in 4 years and it was about fortnight,  a videogame.    People namecall on both sides,  watering down words.   Statistics and justice should matter,  though... like,  my dad sold meth but I shouldn't arrest all fathers. The % of total fathers selling meth isn't higher just because I find one.",TwilightBubble,2025-04-30T18:41:04,1
Then follow the process. You'd be shocked to hear the barrier to deport someone isn't super high. They just refuse to do that because they want to juice the numbers for Dear Leader.,2_Spicy_2_Impeach,2025-04-29T23:03:55,32

"So your argument is that Trump ran on bypassing the legal right to due process, and 70 million dumbasses voted for him because of that? That is the statement you want to make?   Also, what do you mean by fetishization of 3rd wording the US? The US as it stands now, was built by illegal and legal immigrants. Also, where are these numbers of tens of millions of military aged illegal immigrants coming from?   So the Tl;dr is you classify all illegal immigrants as military aged men who are gang or cartel members who are turning the US into a third world country. Did I get that all right?   Here is a bit of a news flash for you champ, the last time Trump ran for office, MAGA terrorists assaulted the US Capitol and cried for 4 years over false claims of voter and election fraud. Those January 6th criminals had their due process. They had attorneys, hearings, plea deals, and trials and they are all free because of a corrupt twat waffle who convinced enough of you knuckleheads that'd he'd fix everything.   So my question for you once again, did you read the 5th and the 14th Amendment and comprehend the phrases mentioned in each containing the words ""No Person"" and how that relates to the topic at hand? Do you know the meaning of that phrase and how it applies to the law?",Boilerman30,2025-04-29T23:31:08,18

Due process allowed you to respond in a court. Someone says you committed a crime you respond with no. Someone says you're not a citizen. You can say yes I am here is my passport. Without due process you don't get to respond. You can have the papers in your pocket. Doesn't matter. You don't get to respond. I dont think you realize how fuxking scary this situation actually is.,AlwaysTh3Optimist,2025-04-29T23:16:54,24

No chance to prove otherwise in front of a judge because what’s a little collateral damage, right?
