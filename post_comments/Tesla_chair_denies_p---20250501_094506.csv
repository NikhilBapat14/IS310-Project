"""No plans to replace Musk."" Of course not - why replace the guy who turned a trillion-dollar company into his personal meme lab and legal liability generator? Teslaâ€™s running on vibes, lawsuits, and increasingly nervous shareholders. ðŸš—ðŸ’¥ðŸ“‰",Spiritual-Score1926,2025-05-01T09:58:58,5

Elon owns the board. He's not going anywhere.,smersh101,2025-05-01T10:18:36,2
Tesla is fucked. Half the people buy the car because of him and the other half won't touch Tesla. Changing CEO will flip who's buying the cars but won't increase sales.,AllynCrane,2025-05-01T10:20:32,2

I mean the brand will always line Musks pockets aswell,LegitimatelisedSoil,2025-05-01T20:37:50,1
"What's really going on is the agencies that CEO's are vetted through leaked that Tesla wants to vet a bunch of new CEO prospects.  So the Board decided to move forward replacing Elon.  And so Elon decided to be a good boy and stop playing government and stop destroying the Tesla brand.  But if I were the Tesla board, I'd dump his ass anyway. Revenue dropped 71%.  Elon is a walking dumpster fire.  So the clock is ticking on him being forced out anyway.",Jedi_Lazlo,2025-05-01T10:10:42,2
"I don't think so. Not only are the board his sycophants, Teslas entire valuation is based on being led by Elon.  We have to remember that they haven't been a car company for a long time, and if they actually went back to being one the stock would crash.  So what to do? Crash the stock today or go into bankruptcy in five years? I think we all know the answer.",awildstoryteller,2025-05-01T10:33:07,1
