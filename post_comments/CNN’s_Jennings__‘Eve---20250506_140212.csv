"I’ve been saying this to people who complain about these deportations being unconstitutional. If you actually read the law and not DHS policy it makes it clear entering the country illegally is committing an immigration crime and thus makes you a criminal.

"Stephen Miller posted this on X yesterday and I think it sums things up beautifully:  **""The right of “due process” is to protect citizens from their government, not to protect foreign trespassers from removal.""**  [https://x.com/StephenM/status/1919377123266937140](https://x.com/StephenM/status/1919377123266937140)",MrsKiwi66,2025-05-06T15:23:14,59
">PHILIP: do you believe that undocumented immigrants have to have due process rights, that that’s constitutionally what they’re entitled to?  Let me cook, yes, but here is the catch, undocumented immigrants include those who overstay their visas and those who illegally cross our border   What trump currently does is “mostly” constitutional based on a federal law called expedited removal process. The expedited removal process (authorized under section 235(b)(1) of the immigration and nationality act (INA)) allows for a deportation process without a formal hearing (due process), this law applies to:  1. Illegal immigrants within 100 miles of the US border and within 14 days of entry  2. Illegal immigrants who arrive at a port of entry without proper documentation   3. Illegal immigrants who can’t prove their identity or proper documentation while continuously residing in the US for 2 years.  However, trump’s executive order removed certain restrictions such as   1. “Within 14 days”  2. “While continuously residing in the US for 2 years”  This action by trump is considered fully legal and doesn’t violate the constitution because the executive branch has the authority to direct how the law of expedited removal process applies  For those who overstay their visas, yes, they are 100% entitled to due process, but they are also 100% eligible for deportation. In most cases, they will be deported shortly after receiving a hearing in court",Emilia963,2025-05-06T14:49:07,19

"One thing I've noticed is that the Left is always screeching, ""OmG, cOnSeRvAtIvEs HaTe ImMiGrAnTs!1!"".   But they always silently lump *illegal aliens* into the same category as legal immigrants so that they don't have to deal with any pesky moral dilemmas that would arise when forced to admit that Conservatives might have a valid point.  Conservatives don't hate legal immigrants.  They just want the illegal aliens to be sent back across the border to apply through legal means.  Foreign nationals need to be vetted and subject to restrictions on the number we allow to enter per year rather than the uncontrolled flood we saw during Biden/Kamala's reign.",MildlyBemused,2025-05-06T21:52:01,44
