">The White House shared what appears to be an AI-generated image of Trump, with heavily muscled and veiny arms, flanked by two bald eagles, wielding a lightsaber to celebrate Star Wars Day, celebrated on May the 4th.  >""Happy May the 4th to all, including the Radical Left Lunatics who are fighting so hard to bring Sith Lords, Murderers, Drug Lords, Dangerous Prisoners, & well known MS-13 Gang Members, back into our Galaxy. You're not the Rebellion‚Äîyou're the Empire,"" the post read.  >Trump's lightsaber in the image is red. A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, lightsaber colors suggested who could be trusted ‚Äî and who had fallen to the dark side of the Force.  >In filmmaker George Lucas' words, ""Good guys are green and blue.

"I recieved an interesting reply to a post I made about conservatives, that stated it's all about class wars. According to him, the Democratic Party is an elistist party that kicks down on uneducated people and less smart people, and thats why people vote republican. Trump is apparently a politician for the 'common' (read: Uneducated) man.  Like literally voting for the party that wants more uneducated people just to make themselves feel better.     And that reply actually scared me, becuse I recon there's a fuckton of people in the US that thinks in this exact way. ""These people could afford college, fancypants fuckers, I hate them, I'll vote for the guy that will fuck these people over the most"".",no_va_det_mye,2025-05-05T02:16:23,5
