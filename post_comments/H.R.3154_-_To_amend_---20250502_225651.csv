"Your link kinda is the Social Security Act Title XI. But it’s not very helpful, it’s basically the title. The actual, full Title XI is a bit long, it deals with general funding, administrative things, and peer review for quality of service. The sponsor and co-sponsors of the bill seem to be Delegates, kinda like Representatives but for American territories(not states), they can sponsor bills but Reps are the ones who vote. Considering they’re Delegates for territories, this bill might be to remove the mandatory ceiling amount of funding the USA gives the territories. The USA limits how much it gives a year to Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, etc.   I don’t recommend reading Title XI, it’s way too much text. But here’s the link.
