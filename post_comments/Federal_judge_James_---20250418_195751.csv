"“Help us, judge!” “Can’t do it. Supreme Court made that clear.” The dumbass still would if he could 🤣😂🤣",rdenghel,2025-04-18T20:13:03,64

"First time for everything.  If the ACLU wanted relief from the deportation orders it should have sought it in Texas.  But there should be no ability to challenge. If an immigration judge determines an illegal immigrant should be deported, that's it. Game over. Go home. You got your due process.",social_dinosaur,2025-04-18T20:13:01,48
"Holy shit, Judge Skeletor can read?  j/k.  Dude finally made the right call.  I guess blind squirrels can find a nut here and there.",j3remy2007,2025-04-18T21:42:49,10
"“I’m sympathetic to your conundrum, but I don’t think I have the power to do anything about it,” Boasberg said during an emergency hearing in the District Court for Washington, DC.   The judge noted that a Supreme Court ruling earlier this month, which lifted his pause on the Trump administration’s use of the Alien Enemies Act, determined that if “detainees are confined in Texas … venue is improper in the District of Columbia.”  Here is Boasberg who is sympathetic (how nice and thoughtful of him, free will) to their conundrum but can’t do anything about it.  Thank YHWH you can’t. Also, you are a political activist boasberg, not a judge.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-18T23:45:46,12
"I can't help but wonder if a clerk for one of the nine made a call and passed along a private ""suggestion?""",Celebril63,2025-04-18T21:37:56,7
Agreed. He realizes he doesn’t have the power he thinks he does.,ITrCool,2025-04-18T20:36:16,47
"Are these guys facing an immigration judge though?  I think they’re just being deported under the statute, rhight, no judge?",j3remy2007,2025-04-18T21:44:08,19

"I'm not sure, but generally speaking our court system makes plaintiffs go through the lowest courts before they can appeal anything. Petitioning Boasberg should mean these people have already been rejected by an immigration judge, but the left doesn't care much about rules and procedures. I know Garcia had been rejected by 2 immigration judges yet here he is still challenging rulings somehow.",social_dinosaur,2025-04-19T07:04:02,0

"If the ACLU went to any judges before boasberg, itd be mentioned in their filing and there’d be public record of the decision.  This was also an emergency hearing to stop the flights, so unlikely the ACLU went to anyone else first.     But I’m talking about the guys actually being deported.  Have they been before an immigration judge With a deportation order, or are they just being deported under the Alien Enemies statute?",j3remy2007,2025-04-19T07:46:23,3
"I read into it a little more and they're trying to deport them under the statute regardless of their immigration status. Seems the admin is fed up with the delays caused by the backlog of cases and the ""due process"" issues. Then SCOTUS comes along this morning and puts a stay on all these TDA cases.
