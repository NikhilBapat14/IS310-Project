Good goal to have. Unfortunately the criteria he lists doesn’t include “who was your daddy and who does he know” that seems to be a corner stone of military academy admissions.,MapleMonstera,2025-05-10T12:45:49,203

"The congressional nomination process is literally a ""who you know"" check the box requirement that's existed for decades lol. I wish there was a streamlined process for the everyday hopeful highschooler to meet with nominators.",adoboseasonin,2025-05-10T12:50:05,84
"This is how it is in all business and advancement in our society. Anyone who tells you different either already got theirs/wants you to not know how they got there, or is ignorant.    There is literally no way to make a society run off of merit as long as people are involved in the process. Much like a degree, merit only gets you past the bar to *be considered*. But if you aren't liked as much as the next guy, it doesn't matter how much better a candidate you are.",Sangmund_Froid,2025-05-10T14:34:54,20
"Hot take: I think alumni children should have that taken into consideration; but only in a way that if two candidates are identical, the legacy candidate would have an edge.",Cronamash,2025-05-10T12:51:04,14
"Well the process of ""admissions"" at any educational institution is prone to complete corruption because the whole idea of a small group of intellectual elites ""choosing"" who gets to be ""educated"" is completely corrupt.",ENERGY-BEAT-ABORTION,2025-05-10T18:48:02,1

"Agree.  I was really surprised at the process in high school. Came from  nothing family in a nothing town. How to turn this high schooler into a wheeling dealing handshaker with state lawmakers was beyond me.   It’s a system I don’t understand though. The military works how it works and anyone I’ve known to go through the the naval or Air Force academy has been the best and brightest , who also happened to come from the same cloth.",MapleMonstera,2025-05-10T12:52:09,24
"I received a nomination. I had zero ties to my congressman, zero real history of military in my family, and my family would he considered lower class. My experience may have been unique, but I can only say a few of my classmates had any sort of hookup and that was because of a parent serving in the military.",falconvision,2025-05-10T17:41:27,9
Well the whole process of getting politically nominated for any political position is completely corrupt because the whole political process requires an absurd amount of resources that only the elites of society can ever possess.,ENERGY-BEAT-ABORTION,2025-05-10T18:55:56,1
"If you had a long successful career as a navy or army officer... it is reasonable to assume that you likely raised your kid to have the same stuff you do.  Not always, but more often then not.    Military legacies are ok with me.",Texas103,2025-05-10T16:27:26,8
I agree with legacy. Military families are a special breed and I would rather support them than not.,MapleMonstera,2025-05-10T12:54:32,2
