"I find it hilarious even tho Carville is an old dumb goat he actually is giving them realistic advice, but this commies just cannot help themselves, it must be *everyone* thats wrong, and they gotta go HARDER LEFT.",Chikaze,2025-05-08T08:16:39,49

"One of the more blatant examples of the Old Guard attacking the new as they start realizing their own growing irrelevance...as well as the fruits of their own labor. Conservatives didn't make ""Little Mogadishu"", James. Conservatives didn't give us ""the Squad"".",Briguy28,2025-05-08T07:28:47,31

"The left's attempts at manufacturing heroes with *TV Magic* the past 10 years produced an endless series of plop culture divas using politics to make themselves rich and famous.  GOP replaces its useless old guard with people's champions, DNC stocks all its shelves with buyer's remorse then the old guys are coming out of retirement just to hold things together.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-05-08T11:15:09,3

"Carville has moments of lucid, common sense takes, and he is one of the liberals who has been a pretty big critic of woke leftism. He's in the ""Bill Maher cluster"" of liberals, though Maher is more willing to break bread with conservatives than Carville.",Antisocial_Worker7,2025-05-08T13:47:59,7
