">“Many worried that Trump's electoral victory would create a tidal wave in support of extreme right populist parties across the world while encouraging them to intensify their extremism,"" says Vivien Schmidt, a professor emerita at Boston University.  ... it's to be honest good to see voters, especially in places like Canada and Australia, recognizing that this kind of volatile political maneuvering just doesn't work, and choosing leaders who prioritize stability and... well, common sense, really, a wave of sanity, perhaps. It's just... nice.",Tremenda-Carucha,2025-04-23T07:12:29,54

I'm in the UK. My dad was at one point quite receptive to Nigel Farage. His association with Trump has ended that stone dead. Wouldn't surprise me if there's many other people with similar stories.,MattBD,2025-04-23T07:44:12,2

French here.  Sure Le Pen far right leader had lost some useful cards with Trump and Putin aggressive attitude toward Europe.  No reason to list all Trump BS right ?

"It's a lot like when Kanye went on Infowars and was talking about how he loves Hitler. Alex Jones spent most of the interview trying to corral him into not saying he loves Hitler. Not because Jones hates Hitler, not because Jones is not a Nazi, they agree on those principles, but because he knows you gotta dog whistle that stuff if you hope to get normies on your side. When they're in deep, then go mask off. Or how Scientology doesn't hit you with the Galactic Lord Xenu threw all the evil souls into a volcano and they then infected us all bullshit until you're super deep into it. And try as Jones did, Kanye just wasn't getting it and would continually be like ""nah, I love Hitler! I love everyone! (That's the part he thinks is some clever checkmate).  Don't trust any of these worldwide right wing ghouls trying to just say shit to distance themselves from Trump. They, like every moron who supports him, were warned about all of this all the time. People have been calling that Trump was on a path to authoritarian shit since 2015. Just because they're bummed that it's burning them too doesn't mean they deserve an ounce of sympathy or even the benefit of the doubt.",SadFeed63,2025-04-23T07:42:35,30

"Here in Australia our Trump lite called his party ""Trumpet of Patriots"".  Fortunately, they are a political joke but they funnel their votes to conservatives.    He spent $70M in advertising at the last federal election for a single seat in parliament.",steelhips,2025-04-23T09:25:45,6

"He has done way more than that. He just handed the world to China.   • He made the US look unreliable. Obama sets up global agreements, Trump pulls out, Biden goes back in, Trump pulls out again.    • He got China, South Korea, and Japan to work together.  • His Trade War made people see China as a levelheaded, stable trading partner.    • He cut US foreign aid & research. Guess who's going to come in and fill the gap?    China has just been thrown cultural and economic power. For free.

"Note that Hitler and the Nazi's operated the same way before they took over. They called for violence on groups or specific people and then denounced the people who did the violence in their name. They praised and ridiculed foreign leaders subscribing to far right ideologies as required. They lied to judges and newspapers about what they believed to play the system, safe in the knowledge that their followers expected them to do just that. Internally, they joked about how ""clever"" they were to dodge the legal and political consequences of their behaviour.  Hypocrisy is a virtue in the eyes of people like these. It's another form of power they have over those who play by the rules, have morals or value truth and decency. This is not just a cabal of evil people playing their followers for fools. It's an entire movement of people who reject empathy and morality as ""weakness"". They revel in their leaders' dishonesty, the hypocrisy and the disdain for rules and norms because they want the same things: complete freedom of conscience and consequences. They want to feel ""good"" even as they harm those they don't like, because it gives them a feeling of power and an emotional catharsis. And if that means they have to twist reality and morality around whatever narrative happens to suit the present situation, then they will do just that.",barryvm,2025-04-23T08:29:20,13

"I’ll be happy if Carney wins, but people have short memories. Carney is only up by 8 points.  These people aren’t going away. The problems that created Trumpism in the first place are only getting worse. Media illiteracy, rising inequality and homelessness, rural decay, etc. And younger generations are surprisingly conservative, especially young men.  I fear that there is really nowhere that is safe from the specter of global fascism, especially with the looming climate crisis. When previously populated areas are rendered basically uninhabitable by climate change, the influx of climate refugees is going to make the American border panic look insignificant by comparison.",banned-from-rbooks,2025-04-23T09:25:07,9
