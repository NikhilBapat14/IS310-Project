It’s so wild seeing the spin machine in real time. For once in their puny lives can the GOP act as a check on their dear leader.   Instead they choose to act only when things truly get bad and they are facing losing seats. They they’ll say “We didn’t think this would happen blah blah blah”  Absolute bs,getbread44,2025-04-07T19:14:25,1
"From Semafor's Burgess Everett:  The White House and Republican leaders have blunted growing momentum for several efforts to slow down President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff regime, even as global economic chaos continues.  In quick succession on Monday, the GOP’s senior leaders clamped down on the bipartisan Trade Review Act, which would require Congress to vote on new presidential tariffs within 60 days. Trump’s White House issued a veto threat that said the bill “would dangerously hamper the president’s authority,” House Speaker Mike Johnson said Trump deserves “latitude” on the issue, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune declared that the bill doesn’t have a “future” in Congress.  Seven Senate Republicans had already backed the measure, led by Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., and a companion House bill was coming from Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb. But after several days of growing support from Republicans, the quick action by the White House, Thune and Johnson appeared to put the bill on ice.  “I don’t think a lot of folks believed that was moving towards becoming a law. I think it was more of a statement by some to say, ‘this tariff piece is different,‘” Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., told Semafor.  Lankford, the No. 5 GOP leader, said he didn’t consider signing on to it “because I don’t think it’s going to become law.” Several Republicans agreed on Monday evening after Trump’s veto threat, despite another wild day of stock market gyration as investors panic over the tariffs.  It’s a signal that Republican leaders’ jobs aren’t just about passing Trump’s agenda at the moment — they’re also safeguarding that agenda from potential critics in his own party.

"James Carville was right  Right after Trump took office, his recommendation was to let this administration destroy themselves, as the most effective way to take back control.  And it happened just as he predicted. Even sooner than he predicted   I think before the year is up, we will have at least (2) cabinet members bail",RJ5R,2025-04-07T19:24:53,1

"Yes, because if there's one thing Trump's been known for in the past it's his subtlety and sense of caution.   There's going to be elections. Stop with the fear mongering.

I think the Wisconsin results last week is certainly a decent sign that things can still not go the GOP's way in elections.  I do think Dems need to be a lot more vigilant for horseplay in 2028 either way though,bravetailor,2025-04-07T19:35:53,1

How effective was it to have Maxine Waters making a scene outside of the locked Dept of Education building? It made Democrats look unhinged  It's more effective to let the administration implode on itself and then swoop in.  I think you are misinterpreting what I said,RJ5R,2025-04-07T20:32:33,1

"Indeed.  I would never argue against voting. But there needs to be better checks perhaps. I can’t say for sure, because here in Canada we still use paper ballots which are counted by hand - but our elections are much smaller in scale than those in the US, so perhaps an electronic system is the only one that will work there.",Earl_I_Lark,2025-04-07T19:34:58,1
