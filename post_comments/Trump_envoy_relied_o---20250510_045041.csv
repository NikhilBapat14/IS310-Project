Part of it is just to be sure.  Putin speaks English fluently but when a mistranslation could permanently damage international relationships you hire an interpreter specialising in political translation. It's just the standard for international meetings.  Putin is definitely not above power plays but I don't think this was one. This was just him following the standard rules for international meetings.,other_usernames_gone,2025-05-10T12:39:39,1
