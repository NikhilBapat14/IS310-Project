"Airmen don't make rank as quickly as in the other branches, Most people aren't selected the first time they are eligible to test. Plus they may have to wait months after the list comes out to officially get their stripe once they are selected. Average time is probably 4-6 years. It's possible she had an Article 15, but I think it's more likely she had some less-than-stellar performance reports, or she was a bad tester.   Anyway, it's disgusting and infuriating that we're awarding the family of this traitorous, oath-breaking asshole.",goodoldjefe,2025-05-02T15:31:36,2
"That doesn't really say that she got any article 15s. up to e4 is automatic for basically just breathing and not getting a felony. e5 is the first rank you actually have to earn. At 12 years of service, you have to be promoted to e5 or you get separated which is what seems to have happened here. If she had mutliple article 15s, she would likely have been out before hitting that 12 year deadline and/or been demoted to a lower rank.",YeetedApple,2025-05-02T15:19:28,1
