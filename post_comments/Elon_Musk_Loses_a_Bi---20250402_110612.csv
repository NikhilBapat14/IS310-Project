"Let's start with SpaceX.  Just for 2024, the US has launched 158 rockets with SpaceX alone, launching 138 of those. China has launched 68. Take SpaceX number out, and the US would have launched only 20. 20! While China launched 68! Source: https://spacestatsonline.com/launches/year/2024  China is injecting a huge and increasing amount of capital into their space program. They already have their own space station that is being continually crewed by their own rockets. They also recently released a long-term plan on Moon, Mars, and outer-planet missions. I would not be surprised if they land on the Moon first before we do again.  SpaceX absolutely upended the global market for rockets. They launch their rockets for significantly cheaper than the competition. They took the commercial market away from Europe and forced them to make a new rocket (Ariane 6) that is still absolute. It is not even partially reusable like SpaceX rockets are.  As SpaceX rockets are partially reusable, they don't have to make brand new rockets each time like others have to. They also are vertically integrated so they can build, test, learn, and launch very quickly. No other rocket company has the economy of scale that SpaceX has.  You talked about ""exploding stuff"". You were probably talking about the SpaceX rockets that have blown up recently. These were test rockets for SpaceX' newest rocket called Starship.  SpaceX method of building a new rocket is the opposite of NASA. Nasa builds the perfect rocket that takes years to build. SpaceX builds a prototype in a few months and launches it. When it explodes, they gather the data, fix the issue, and launch again. Rinse and repeat. They keep launching test articles until they stop exploding, and then they fine-tune it. They test rockets this way because there is a vast amount of data you can only get from launching and not just from computer simulations. Also, because of their vertical integration and them building their own launch facilities, they can launch even faster than other companies that are outsourced and lease launch facilities.  Their workhorse rocket, the Falcon 9, went through such a testing regime. Now the Falcon 9 is the most launched rocket in history.  Now Tesla.  Tesla is also highly vertically integrated. This allows Tesla to test and innovate very quickly. And they don't stop innovating. A car built 6 months later can look different under the hood.  They were the first American fully electric car company. They didn't have to transition from combustion cars to ev like legacy auto companies have too (Ford, GM, etc). These companies have to invest in making EVs that will eventually crater their combustion cars, which is their bread and butter. In other words, if EVs are the future, legacy auto have to cut off their arm to save themselves. It will cost them a MASSIVE amount of money to transition to EVs. They are not the same as combustion cars. Many car companies won't survive the transition.  Also, Tesla has much lower debt than Ford and GM. As of 2024, Tesla only has $5.757B, GM has $90.3B, and Ford has $103.573B. (Source from Macrotrends.net)  Ford and GM might be two of the companies that might not survive the transition if the government doesn't step in to bail them out...again.  Let's talk self-driving. Tesla doesn't have self-driving in the sense that the car will drive you, by itself, wherever you want. But it is getting closer every day. Why? Because of data.  Every Tesla car has cameras that feed data to Tesla so the AI can learn. The more cars they sell and the longer their cars are driven, the more data Tesla has to feed the AI. Tesla receives BILLIONS of miles driven every year to feed the AI. Tesla has built multiple data centers with supercomputers not just to go through the data but to build and innovate their AI. Because of this, Tesla is able to send out software updates to their cars every few weeks.  Other American car companies that build EVs just can not do this. They sell a fraction of evs that Tesla does, and they only update their software a few times a year at best.  Tesla is not just cars, though. They make their own battery systems and solar panels, which they call their energy sector. They can build battery farms that stabilize solar farms. They also sell batteries for individual homes. All their products work together.  Tesla has stated that they believe their energy sector will outsell their auto sector in the future.  Tesla is also building their own robot, Optimus. Optimus will be using the same AI that they use in their cars. If they succeed, Tesla has stated that Optimus will outsell their energy sector.  That is why I am not too worried about the Tesla hate right now. The auto-sector is only a portion of what Tesla is. They are much bigger than just cars.  The only competition for Tesla in any of these three sectors (auto, energy, and Optimus) is not in America. It is China. China is already arguably dominating us in robotics.  In summary, Tesla is dominating in most of their markets. And this is an American company! We need Tesla to compete with China.  On a side note, since Tesla has disrupted the rocket, ev, and energy markets, it has pushed other companies all over the world to do the same. I don't want Tesla to become a Monopoly in anything; we need competition.  However, it seems China is the only one that is competitive right now.",Voyager_AU,2025-04-02T22:09:36,3

"Dude is worth billions.  It doesn't matter if he uses Tesla stock as leverage.  He can still get loans from other wealthy people or just take out a loan without the leverage.  This is something that the rich already do and is how Trump, and others, can declare bankruptcy multiple times and money still lands in their laps.  It's how a 'disgraced' CEO can be fired from one company and land another CEO position relatively quickly.  It's not what they did or how they lost your money that they care about.  It's who they are and how they made the money in the first place that is the value proposition.

"People need to remove their feelings from this.  People also need to realize that Musk is not living off his Tesla stock as though it were a salary.  But yes, he is living off using his stock as collateral for loans.  In fact, because loans are not considered salary/wage, they are not taxed, and this is how rich people acquire their spending cash.  Take out a $50M loan at 2-3% APR and that is a hellofalot cheaper than paying income tax.    As long as lenders are confident in the total assets value, the loans can keep coming in.    I am not arguing that tactics against Tesla are not 'working' or are not political.  The reality of how wealthy people handle money and acquire money is not the same as stocks dropping from political pressure.  The best tactic is to simply not buy the product.  And if someone really wants a Tesla, then to buy used from a 3rd party and buy into the add-ons or whatever (and I suppose to not use Super Chargers, too).  As someone who drives a non-Tesla EV, I guarantee you that there are a shitload of EV drivers out there who hate Musk and yet really want access to the Super Chargers.   Musk is a paper billionaire.  Meaning, he doesn't actually have $350B or whatever in cash sitting in a bank account.  Also, despite using Tesla stock as leverage, he still does own 6 other businesses.  Being a paper billionaire means that his net worth will drop, yes, but once again, this is only on paper.  He still has massive holdings in SpaceX, Neurolink, Boring, and now xAI.  Anyways, whatever loss Tesla takes is proportional to the amount of holdings Musk has, ..., and is a paper loss.  SpaceX is still worth $150B and xAI is now something like $90B.  So yeah, he would take a hit, but even if Tesla completely tanked and disappeared, he would still remain a billionaire.   What is the value of Musk's stocks, when purchased?
