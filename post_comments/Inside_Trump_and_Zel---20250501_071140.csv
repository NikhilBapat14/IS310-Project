"Do you have any idea the level of incompetent you have to be, when your mere presence is enough to make it more difficult to work with TRUMP, of all people?  The man with an ego only matched by his waist, who reads/speaks AT BEST at the level of a fourth-grader, and is in doubt as to whether or not he knows ANY of what he is doing?  How!?",ragingreaver,2025-05-01T18:18:03,1

"Maybe entertainment for his stupidity, but,  that's about it. Even couches benefit from J.D Vance's absense as if furniture could talk, even the couch wouldn't want him around.  I don't even know who/what I pity more, J.D Vance (I would hate to be him) or the couch that has to suffer the burden of his presence, even if he's just gently hugging the cushion with his arms and legs and not aggressively raping it.",ToughAuthorityBeast1,2025-05-01T10:19:33,1
