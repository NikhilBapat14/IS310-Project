"Nobody is talking about how it's in Trump's best interest to start a war.  Don't get me wrong, he will stand up to whatever Superpower, one that no other administration ever would dare challenge (see China tariffs), and in doing so will probably usurp a few extra years in the WH, but after the assassination attempt, he's been no holds barred in terms of policy; if any Axis power threatens the status quo Trump will make sure to print his mark on it before he leaves office. Kinda scary but also kinda inevitable. But actually not. Hopefully you know what I mean.  So, yeah, downvote me liberal brigade, but Trump is going to enact no elections during war which will most likely be WW3 which with the capacity for nukes is terrifying.  I oddly am not afraid of Russia in terms of nukes launched in WW3. Russia is at the whims of Putin but I strongly believe the power structure will not follow through with MAD.  China on the otherhand, that's a country I could see ending the world. Even Iran is ""Islam"" in the fact they never fight ""unjust wars"". Iran will never launch a nuke. Ever. And actually, Iran is changing moving towards enlightenment every day.

We would not accept unconditional surrender, and the total destruction of our way of life as a result, to Russia... There is no reason to expect Russia would respond any differently than we would.

"Sorry I didn't have the fruition to expand on my original premise because I didn't expect needing to clarify, but will happily do so now.  If/when WW3 inevitably kicks off (in the next 3-5 years) President Trump will have the authority to suspend elections and fight it as a war-time President.  If/when WW3 inevitably kicks off, I don't anticipate Russia being the ones on the other end of the MAD condition. I think the West will generally allow Russia to exist with heavy investment in making sure they never flip again, while China and the East on the otherhand are much harder~~ing~~ to reign in.  China is very much so at a point where they would either accidentally retaliate in nobodies best interest (they would nuke first) or would view their 100 year world plan as an utter failure and resign to their borders.  In both scenarios the Allies defeat the Axis, but are never able to fully make them capitulate to our demands out of fear of nuclear retaliation.   Keep in mind there is also a timeline where the Allies defeat the Axis, and afterwards are able to denuclearize the world entirely.  That's the pipedream. Never let it die.  edit: whatever, i can't spell.",PatTheBatsFatNutsack,2025-05-07T12:27:26,0

"There is zero chance the west denuclearizes the world. They might want to denuclearize Russia and China and NK, there's no way the US (and possibly other countries) would ever give up it's nuclear weapons, even if it meant denuclearizing the entire world. I don't see Russia/China/NK giving up their nukes while the west keeps theirs, and I don't think the west would accept a denuclearization deal other than that.      I also don't think that Russia 1) doesn't want any part of a full on war with the US in any capacity and 2) doesn't want to use nuclear weapons first, and can pretty successfully avoid that being on the table if they do my first point     NK is probably the most dangerous in terms of what they want to do ... but their capability is questionable at best right now.     The big oddballs here are China and Taiwan. Right now the west has a big interest in protecting Taiwan because of TSMC. But as Intel/Samsung/TSMC are building new high-tech fabs outside of Taiwan, will that go away? What happens if/when the west has enough fabs outside of Taiwan for their own needs?

"Leaving aside the whole ""suspend elections"" nonsense (sorry, that is so fantastical as to not even warrant a serious response), your base premise that the west won't seek the complete subjugation of Russia, as well China, is, well, not to be overly blunt, extremely naive.  In the event of ww3 it would be incumbent on the allies to show restraint to avoid placing Russia and China in positions where the use of nuclear weapons becomes the only way for them to avoid being completely subjugated.  The west is not likely to show such restraint, especially in the scenario where we are talking ww3, aka total war, and the damage and hardships incurred in fighting such a war would demand complete subjugation of the enemy or else be widely condemned as unjust.",Shadeylark,2025-05-07T13:03:29,4

And yes, the west won't use nukes first (not out of any moral principle mind you... Simply because circumstances won't necessitate the west to use them)  In a hypothetical scenario where the roles are reversed and the west is faced with unconditional surrender, the west absolutely would use nukes first in an attempt to preserve themselves.
