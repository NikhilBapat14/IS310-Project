"""It erodes the kind of trust and safety that is necessary for students to be able to engage in learning and the free expression which is at the core of what we do in higher education."" This type of action is not good for the educational system nor for the Amercian future and competitiveness.   Potential future scholars, professors and students will opt to study in other countries. Many EU countries including Canada welcome foreign students: China and Russia will to among others. In the end we will be the ultimate losers. End up losing the best and the brightest to competitors.",PsychLegalMind,2025-04-30T18:05:09,4
