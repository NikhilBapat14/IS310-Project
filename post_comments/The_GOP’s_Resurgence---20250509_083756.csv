">But the proposals don’t include basic and undeniably effective ideas like subsidized child care or paid parental leave. Instead, the Trump administration appears to be considering a $5,000 cash “baby bonus” and a “National Medal of Motherhood” for any woman who has six or more children.  Yeah like $5k is going to defray the costs of raising 6 children lmao.  They want to force women to have children by banning abortion, but once the kid is born they'll do nothing to make sure there's financial support for them.  They make idiots look smart.",superanth,2025-05-09T08:40:02,11
The GOP doesn’t care about kids. They care about cheap uneducated labor that they can exploit,Be-skeptical,2025-05-09T08:54:32,5
"during the course of jimmy carters lifetime world population multiplied by 4. that is a runaway surge.  the gop is pushing forced birth for two reasons: to maintain large exploitable lower class populations, and to maintain white majority in the US as white supremacists fear white people will become a minority population in the next 20 years.  pro-natalism is propaganda to those ends. if you want to have kids, fine, that's natural. if you don't want to have kids, Great! that is also natural. Animals respond to crowding and resource scarcity (rising cost of living) by having less babies. so have less babies, or better yet adopt a dog - the future will thank you!",Virbillion,2025-05-09T08:57:16,3
This has radical evangelicalism written all over it.  NO ONE is going to have a baby when they can't afford anything. $5K is a drop in the bucket when birthing and raising a child costs hundreds of thousands of dollars.,mhouse2001,2025-05-09T09:11:03,3
">*The contemporary pro-natalist movement has found a leader in Trump, who has aligned himself with some of the ideology’s most extreme advocates, including far-right influencer Jack Posobiec and billionaire Elon Musk. Musk, who was never far from Trump’s side at the start of his second term, has fathered 14 children and routinely voices concerns about “population collapse” due to declining birth rates.*  It’s sheer self-destructive insanity how Trump, Musk, and the far-right pro-natalist crowd are freaking out about “population collapse” while completely ignoring the fact that we’re in the middle of a human-driven mass extinction event where overpopulation and overconsumption are *the* root causes of climate breakdown, ecosystem collapse, and resource scarcity.  Researchers have been sounding the alarm for years—extinction rates are hundreds to a thousand times higher than normal (Ceballos et al., 2017 & 2020). So the idea that the solution is “more babies,” especially with this weird racial undertone, is just… detached from reality.  If the Trump-MAGA crime regime actually cared about the future, they’d be expanding access to birth control, abortion, and education—things that reduce pressure on people and the planet. But instead they’re pushing this agenda that is less about concern for humanity and more like preserving a certain demographic’s dominance, i.e., white supremacy.  Musk having 14 kids isn’t solving anything—it’s just privilege cosplay in a collapsing world.  ""*We are not just in danger of losing species—we are losing the life support systems of civilization*.”   — Dr. Gerardo Ceballos, ecologist and lead author on multiple extinction studies",haiku2572,2025-05-09T09:05:18,2
"the last thing we need is even more white trumpie women having over 6 kids. the mormons have that part covered. if anything, we need to limit numbers of kids if we want to stretch our planets resources for as long as possible",tryingnottocryatwork,2025-05-09T09:02:03,4
They don't want the population to get small because then the country is small (instead of big and strong and powerful with big muscles). They don't understand that they have no say in individuals' decisions to have or not have kids. They don't understand that because they think they run shit -- because they're white guys.,30mil,2025-05-10T06:54:45,1
"5k didn’t even cover the out of pocket costs between pregnancy and childbirth  for my wife and I, it’s a laughable bribe.",warm_sweater,2025-05-09T15:30:19,3
They really only want white and uber wealthy people to have many kids.  White and uber wealthy people can afford the costs of raising 6 children.  Everybody else and their kids can just fuck off and die.  This includes MAGA and  their rugrats.,ResidentKelpien,2025-05-09T08:45:53,2
"Absolutely right! We are ""in the middle of a human-driven mass extinction event where overpopulation and overconsumption are *the* root causes of climate breakdown, ecosystem collapse, and resource scarcity"" - I'd add the crisis of global plastic waste, electronic waste, industrial waste, and textile waste. Encouraging more breeding is...profoundly stupid.",Impulsive_Artiste,2025-05-09T10:29:47,2
I always found the ecosystem of tge ocean to be a fascinating conundrum    Like plankton and krill essentially are the life support for fish any as temps rise they are becoming depleted once that happens game over man,Miserable_Archer_769,2025-05-09T10:47:59,2
