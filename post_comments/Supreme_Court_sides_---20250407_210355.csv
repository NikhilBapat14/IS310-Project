"Read this article, then you'll see how outrageous it is. I (LEO) can come to your house, call your kid a gangbanger, even if he has all of his paperwork in order, then haul him off to another country.",IndependentRegion104,2025-04-07T21:07:18,1

But the article says:  A divided court on Monday night agreed to lift a judge’s order that temporarily blocked the president’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to swiftly deport people from the U.S. while a legal challenge plays out. But the justices said the immigrants are “entitled to notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal” in front of a judge.  Dies this mean they get a lawyer and time to prepare for said challenge?  Or it a sham like everything in this admin?,animalslover4569,2025-04-07T21:14:04,1

Yep!   Let it be a wake up call to everyone that has hoped SCOTUS was going to rein in Trump.,hamsterfolly,2025-04-07T21:09:10,1
I just can't believe that they would let this stand. Just feels like a repeat of history when the Germans started hauling people off to foreign countries or concentration camps.,IndependentRegion104,2025-04-07T21:11:45,1

"""....The Supreme Court will allow Donald Trump to CONTINUE summarily deporting alleged Venezuelan gang members under a centuries-old wartime law after the administration had already deported dozens of immigrants to a notorious El Salvador prison....""  So those justices don't exactly understand (believe) the concept of blind justice, or am I missing something.",IndependentRegion104,2025-04-07T21:23:54,1
