"Remember this next time conservatives say ""We're not anti-immigrant! We just want immigrants to come in legally.""",sachiprecious,2025-05-08T15:02:19,163
It was never about illegal immigration. It was always xenophobia.,accountabilitycounts,2025-05-08T15:12:52,50
"""We can't find enough illegal aliens to deport, so please let us make these half-million legal residents illegal.  Our racist base will lose respect for us if we can't do this."" ~Trump & Noem, essentially",Proud-Wall1443,2025-05-08T14:59:10,74

Is...is that a thing the Supreme Court can do?    I've beyond had it with this regime.,SaintCaricature,2025-05-08T15:05:32,11
"So we’re going to revoke 500,000 people’s legal status, then pay them $1,000 each to self deport.  So afterwards we will be down hypothetically $500 million, yet we can’t afford to keep FEMA around?  I need a Republican to break down the math for me.",Expensive-Cap3159,2025-05-08T15:22:27,16

so now he doesnt want immigrants to come in legally now?,saiyanscaris,2025-05-08T16:14:31,4
Honestly its really cruel to do this. These people had temporary legal status. They started lives here. They have jobs. Some even have mortgages. We gave them temporary status while they get fully legal. They have every right to expect they would be never removed. Thats what temporary legal status means-- fully unconditionally legal.,lucy_throwaway,2025-05-08T18:15:51,5
Remember all these legal filings filed by Noem and the the Executive Orders by Trump originate in the Heritage Foundation and their team of lawyers. Noem and the rest are just the faces of the filings and no even less that their average supporter’s.,johnn48,2025-05-08T17:11:57,3

It’s literally just because he hates Biden,BreakMaximum5807,2025-05-08T22:15:11,1
The administration hasn't cared what the supreme court has said so far so why not just revoke their immigrant status by Executive Order and then go about the business of sending them to death camps then?,Apellosine,2025-05-09T05:41:25,1
"Remember when it comes to conservatives their ideology is always ""fuck everyone that's not me.""  ",arilupe,2025-05-08T15:05:04,64
">We just want immigrants to come in legally.  Yup, just like how Roe v Wade was “settled precedent” lol",xavPa-64,2025-05-08T16:23:09,8
"Why? They won’t remember, or believe it ever happened “and if it did it was probably Biden.”  Standing up for the truth is a good tactic in certain circumstances, but these are more “it just annoys the chicken” type circumstances. For arguing with republicans in 2025, “look at that shiny thing over there!” Is more likely to be a successful tactic than asking them to remember stuff and use words or logic.   Back in the Bush years, and in Trumps first term there were dozens of “mask off” moments. Bringing them up to republicans online was already a waste of time 20 years ago. Remember when they argued that seniors should just “sacrifice themselves for the economy?” Because they sure as shit don’t. They still think Iraq had WMD.",bentforkman,2025-05-08T19:20:28,3

Next thing you will tell me is that the democrats aren't Marxists.  Or that our shower pressure has not gone down.  Or that Arnold Palmer has a small pecker.,knightcrawler75,2025-05-08T15:22:22,7

No. They rule on constitutionality of other lower rulings. They don’t make random rulings on random topics. He’s treating it like his special Kangaroo Court.,lilaponi,2025-05-08T15:53:40,9

Still not their job. They should take it.,lilaponi,2025-05-08T16:55:10,1
100%  I was just pointing out that their own venerated deity of Conservatism granted amnesty to millions of immigrants and criminalized the hiring of the undocumented.  Hypocrisy is all they have left.,ISOaVoidtoScreamInto,2025-05-08T17:00:16,3

"Agreed.  I wonder what previous Republicans would think of all of this like him and Teddy.  I literally have someone in another sub saying Medicare should be abolished because it's not a human right.  Then when I said that's for elderly that can't work and get private insurance through their jobs and he said ""they should get private insurance"". ",arilupe,2025-05-08T17:03:37,1
