"It's ridiculous that the idiots calling others ""snowflakes"" have such massive snowflake-type tantrums about the thought of trans people protecting the country that they ban them from the military.  How exactly does banning trans people from the military help anyone or anything? If you're THIS obsessed over other people's birth genitals, get help dude.",b00hole,2025-05-07T20:14:41,17
"It’s ridiculous that able bodied, trained, patriotic transgender soldiers aren’t able to serve because the commander-in-chief is a raging transphobe.  If these people are able to serve, wouldn’t you want them to serve?",jediporcupine,2025-05-07T20:10:37,14
"The biggest issue with this ruling is that, traditionally, when considering whether to block or allow a policy while the case proceeds through the courts, the court is supposed to rule in favor of the least disruptive path to ensure that no matter what the final ruling is, no undue harm was caused.   In this case, they did the exact opposite. They are allowing transgender service members to be kicked out of the military while the cases are argued, which means if the final ruling struck down the ban, countless transgender troops will have been harmed during the proceedings for no reason.",Reviews-From-Me,2025-05-07T20:14:58,8
Whoa it's almost like the good faith decision would be to stop harmful decisions until they are fully vetted out like the lower courts did.,ZZartin,2025-05-07T20:09:45,3

"Like I've been saying... The MSM puts up this flash headlines that ""Federal Judges Rules Against Trump..."" almost every day. And every day I have to remind folks they are only District Judges. They used to be important and most cases ended with them. But not anymore. They have the power of middle school hall monitors. Until SCOTUS rules... Trump does what he wants.  But here's the real kicker: In this case they ruled in his favor (as they will on most cases). But on the ones they rule against him...? He ignores it because SCOTUS is expecting DOJ to enforce the ruling. Well the DOJ is the German SA directly under the Executive Branch. We are about to see folks learn real fast about the 2A. And it won't be Meal Team Six... Because they are part of the German SA.",williamgman,2025-05-07T21:41:20,2

Trump is trying to weaken our military. He's a Russian asset. Putin's military is decimated and needs Trump to weaken ours to give him leverage.,williamgman,2025-05-07T21:42:54,5

"My understanding of the way injunctions work is that injunctions are ***only*** supposed to be used when a ***legal standard*** of ""Irreparable Harm"" is met. My limited understanding is that ""Irreparable Harm"" generally is something that cannot be provided through a ""Reparation"" of money, jobs, property, etc.   With something like a lawsuit, especially something like this, job loss is *not* considered ""Irreparable Harm"" from a **legal stance**. I add the emphasis to say that Emotional and mental harm is definitely ***not*** something that money can fix, just to note what I've heard the legal standard is for applying injunctions.  The lawsuits will continue and, hopefully win.",EagleDelta1,2025-05-07T20:57:16,1
