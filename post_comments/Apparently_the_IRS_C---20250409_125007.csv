Exile to El Salvador for paying one’s taxes _might_ be considered disincentive to do so.,wraithius,2025-04-09T15:41:52,121
"Well, many migrants pay federal taxes and it will cost the government billions per year when they stop.  DOGE consolidating citizen data is going to result in _constant_ illegal handling of personal information as there are different laws that apply to different agency/collections of data.  It's all illegal and without an independent justice department it will become SOP.",neck_iso,2025-04-09T15:49:03,98
The only reason illegal immigrants pay $100 billion dollars in taxes every year is because the IRS assured them their information won’t be shared with pther agencies…  Say goodbye to that $100 billion a year in revenue. No illegal immigrant will ever pay taxes again,Y0___0Y,2025-04-09T16:01:07,72
"Basically, they’re just telling people not to file their taxes. We make a lot of money from people who are here illegally, but want to become citizens. One of the rules is that they have to pay their taxes, so they do. They’re not gonna do that anymore.",CreatrixAnima,2025-04-09T17:34:20,31
"I'm pretty sure, but I can't cite it right now, that tax returns have, if not full Fifth Amendment protection, high privacy protection due to the requirement of filing.  Not that laws matter any more, but this would be a blatant rug-pull.",hymie0,2025-04-09T16:33:10,31
"If immigrants aren’t paying taxes, then why do they need to get with the IRS to find them?",jgeebaby,2025-04-09T15:58:41,19
This should not be allowed. Not only is it bad for public policy but its a violation of due process -- I'm betting a court could easily find that using other databases is a search under the 4th and requires a warrant and requisite probable cause.,mongooser,2025-04-09T16:58:43,13
"The bigger story is DOGE firing 20,000 IRS workers, especially auditors.  Those are the people who bring in the revenue for the govt.  It's estimated that this will cause a loss of $500 billion in revenue per year.  THIS is the exact OPPOSITE of rooting out waste, fraud and abuse.",satyrday12,2025-04-10T11:52:34,3
"He shouldn't resign when told to do something wrong. That just clears the way for some pussy who will comply.  He should make the bosses fire him, sue for wrongful termination, and publicize the the criminal action..",CalTechie-55,2025-04-10T01:04:22,5
"My broader thoughts are that for some reason in the past ~10 years but particularly since covid, governments seem to have completely stopped caring about reputation and credibility. Those are things that take decades to earn and minutes to lose.  Yet they have done it repeatedly.  It's going to be a real problem when anyone remotely informed really can't trust what their government is telling them about anything.",Waterwoo,2025-04-10T10:40:03,1
"When the *tax* agency starts moonlighting as an immigration cop, something’s gone seriously off the rails.  The IRS’s job is to collect taxes — not to turn tax data into a surveillance tool. If people can’t trust the IRS to keep their info safe, the whole system breaks down.  Resignation might be the start, but the real issue is: who else has access, and what are they doing with it?",Only_Economics7148,2025-04-14T02:34:16,1
 Governments  take away our privacy and civil rights in the name of stopping crime but they always end up using those new government powers to suppress political and religious descent.,Capital_Demand757,2025-04-15T10:25:48,1
"This seems like an idea way to do immigration enforcement.      No one is targeted for their skin color.   Migrants can still go to the police with out fear  schools aren't targeted     The people who object to this, object to removing Unauthorized Migrants, so of course any method that could remove those with out Authorization to be in the US will be something they view as bad.",discourse_friendly,2025-04-10T15:26:40,1
"I thought immigrants didnt pay taxes!?   But what is happening is a travesty, breaking federal law to go after immigrants both legal and illegal is another step towards a very dark place.",Titan7771,2025-04-09T19:17:14,0

Not really.  What typically happens is that a bunch file as dependents under a Head of Household who receives an earned income tax credit.,JKlerk,2025-04-09T21:36:19,-14
"Well..  that will significantly reduce their already somewhat limited employability.   Even though I'm sure most employers know they don't really have work authorization, if they show a SSN and you withhold taxes you have some plausible deniability.   If they have to tell the employer ""cash only"" that's really going to reduce who's willing to hire them.",Waterwoo,2025-04-10T10:42:42,10
"They pay about 100 billion every single year and receive almost none of it.  And it's not like the IRS hasn't been open about it.  It is so incredibly stupid to complain about them ""smooching"" when it is the exact opposite. It is those same people that complain that are the quietest when asked if they would be willing to pick up that tab",Noshino,2025-04-09T20:32:57,20

"Tax returns have zero Constitutional privacy protections per *US* v. *Sullivan*. Even the morass of *Haynes*/*Freed* did not change that, and there is a long history of the judiciary making it absolutely clear that there are no 5th Amendment protections related to the admission of unlawful activities on tax returns.",DanforthWhitcomb_,2025-04-10T00:14:47,8
That's all entirely irrelevant when they're being secreted away to prison camps without due process.,Petrichordates,2025-04-09T16:51:13,27

"Immigrants, including undocumented ones, do pay taxes.",catladywithallergies,2025-04-09T16:10:43,26
The courts disagree with you and have done so since the 16th Amendment became law. There is no due process violation to be found in the government using data that it has lawfully acquired for enforcement purposes.,DanforthWhitcomb_,2025-04-10T00:16:42,6
How is it a violation of due process? I understand not liking it but I fail to see how it related to due process at all…,lauren4shaym,2025-04-09T17:16:09,-5
Yet they are apparently only going for criminals yet multiple kids have been caught up when they can't possibly be in the criminal list. Keep thinking they will do an actual good job. Many vistims will be effected ,BlackBikerchick,2025-04-14T19:04:02,2

They are not eligible for tax credits.  Only legal residents are.,neck_iso,2025-04-10T07:55:38,7
That’s a good point.  This likely won’t just cause immigrants to not pay taxes. They won’t accept jobs that aren’t paid in cash only. And this could affect the labor market,Y0___0Y,2025-04-10T10:53:41,4
Smooching means kissing. You might have meant mooching.,HideGPOne,2025-04-11T10:55:25,2
"The unlawful activity in this case would be immigration-related, rather than pertaining to tax fraud itself?",ColossusOfChoads,2025-04-10T00:32:05,1
"I read *Sullivan* differently than you do. It looks to me that *Sullivan* is specially about prosecuting **for tax evasion** based on income from illegal activities. I'm saying the opposite -- since you are forced to declare income from illegal activities, you have 5A protection for the underlying illegal activities.",hymie0,2025-04-10T04:38:41,1
That’s my point. They’re always talking about how they’re moochers and don’t pay taxes. And now this will cause more tax losses for us and maybe they’ll stop filing all together.  If they’re working and contributing to our tax system why aren’t we just helping them become citizens?,jgeebaby,2025-04-09T16:12:24,21
"Well it’s a violation of federal privacy laws, this information would usually only be accessible to law enforcement with a warrant.",Titan7771,2025-04-09T19:14:24,9
"Without a warrant supported by probable cause that a law has been violated, law enforcement is constitutionally barred from conducting a search of a person or their property. Law enforcement digging through tax filings to search for whomever or whatever they want without a warrant supported by probable cause is similar to the police just forcing their way into a random house and going through the cupboards and drawers, looking for whatever contraband or evidence of a crime they might happen across. It's blatantly unconstitutional.",CaptainoftheVessel,2025-04-09T22:37:08,4

It doesn’t matter what the conduct is. Under the 3rd party doctrine the IRS is allowed to share the info with whoever they want because the return legally belongs to them and not the filer.,DanforthWhitcomb_,2025-04-10T00:39:13,3

"It’s almost like we have ample case law that says you are wrong due to the third-party doctrine—tax returns are not your personal property, they belong to the government…..which is thus allowed to do whatever it wants with them (including sharing them with 3rd parties) without violating the 4th Amendment.     This specific argument is directly covered on the IRS page(s) describing (and refuting) frivolous tax arguments. Trying to raise it in court can and will lead to all kinds of sanctions being levied against the party who does so.",DanforthWhitcomb_,2025-04-10T00:23:08,2
I mentioned migrants which generally refer to undocumented immigrants.  Also the whole point of the sharing (which is not clearly legal) is to identify immigration violations.  That's the whole context of the conversation.,neck_iso,2025-04-10T08:47:42,8
