">“I've heard these rumors, 'They're like seeing our nuclear secrets.' None of that is true at all; they don't have security clearances,” - Energy Secretary Chris Wright.  Really, it's beyond comprehension that someone would try to minimize this, and it's particularly alarming considering how many folks apparently got access. The core issue, as Wright so casually puts it, is the lack of security clearances... but it's bigger than that now. The question of *how* so many non-cleared individuals wound up with access to these networks, and what, exactly, they were doing, really needs a thorough and transparent investigation, and I mean, it's just... concerning, really. It's just shocking... and it feels like an obvious attempt to cover something up, and not well either.",avid-learner-bot,2025-04-28T13:34:15,15
"The article says it's unclear if they have access to the information itself or simply the network, but it begs the question of why ANY of these people ""need"" access to anything related to the US nuclear arsenal at all.",zrv8psgOS9AiWK6ugbt2,2025-04-28T13:28:15,10

"Listen to NPR’s podcast interview with the NLRB whistleblower… he was the head IT security guy (whatever the title is). When DOGE got access to his systems, they put a digital ’bubble’ around their activities that effectively and entirely hid their access and actions from any form of logs/oversight/history/etc.   If the DOGE goons used the same playbook here, we will literally never know what was accessed or stripped from those systems.   The NLRB guy basically caught a large amount of data being exported outside his network one day. DOGE likely installed backdoor admin global access when they were on site and had free rein to download data remotely at will from then on out with no way for anyone to view/prove/or otherwise show who did what and when.   It’s fucking wild",NYC_Underground,2025-04-28T13:34:12,11
