"Nice camera work there, operator.  Every time I see something like this, it breaks my heart. The men on Trumpâ€™s left are prime examples of our finest. They fought for our country, they left whole but came back broken, only to be discarded like trash with reckless abandon by the previous president, his supporters, and his pundits. The treatment that these men and their comrades have received over the previous presidency is vile, and the shattered lives they now live will forever remain.   I wish I was there to thank these men for their service. They need support more than ever.",Ok-Willow-4232,2025-04-24T07:23:27,-3
