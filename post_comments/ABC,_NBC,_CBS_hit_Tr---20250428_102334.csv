Only 92%?  Sounds like someone is gonna be having an uncomfortable talk with them/their boss.,Shadeylark,2025-04-28T10:46:36,42
This after fluffing the brain dead Biden for 4 years.Â    The corrupt mainstream media is just the propaganda arm of the Democratic party.Â Â ,Pinot_Greasio,2025-04-28T10:25:27,73
"Funny enough the left will scream censorship if we say our airwaves should be neutral, since airwaves are publicly owned.  that or mass downvoted and brigade",Timely_Car_4591,2025-04-28T11:23:54,13
The mainstream media is essentially a ham hocked blunt instrument void of consideration on how Americans actually think.  Somewhere in the 1/3-1/4 of people believe what they are told NO MATTER WHAT.  The same amount won't believe what they are told NO MATTER WHAT.  The 1/4-1/3 in the middle find the medias obsession with hating on Trump to be weird and not in interests of journalistic integrity.  The election went the way it did because Americans don't trust the media.  Their condemnation of him fueled his popularity.,Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-04-28T12:09:44,6

"I just saw a story about how his approval rating is at like 45%. But they quietly slipped in that he has lowered the inflation rate and he has lowered the mortgage rate. Amongst other things.   All it is is the negative press. The negative press is causing a negative view on the president. He's not doing anything bad. It's just all this disgusting talk.   Luckily though people are getting tired of it, they're seeing the wrong in what they're doing. They are seeing the one side that if you don't totally agree with them and everything they want. You are a Nazi right.... Well I hate to say it but that's kind of what the Nazis used to say. Lol",Jumpy-Program9957,2025-04-28T15:30:20,4
Imagine if they just reported what's going on instead of telling us their opinion and how we should feel too,smkn3kgt,2025-04-29T02:04:20,1
And yet his approval rating is staying high.  I wonder if their gig is up.,j3remy2007,2025-04-28T10:33:04,-18

Exactly.  I have a hard time believing it isn't 99% negative with 1% neutral.,Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-04-28T11:56:26,59
"One big reason why people voted for Trump was because all the bullshit and gaslighting the mainstream media (cnn, abc, msnbc) was throwing down our throats. Imagine if FOX told you too that economy was good, there was no immigration crisis, Biden crimes were made up by the Russian. Just imagineâ€¦",Zealousideal-Dig8210,2025-04-28T12:19:57,40
Who cares? The point is overall media coverage. Which was 8x more positive for Biden during the same timeframe.,MeLlamoKilo,2025-04-28T11:05:10,-69
"this isn't even about mass media, this about public airwaves not being neutral and being heavly biased against half the country. Even conservatives here don't' understand the difference between MSNBC and NBC.  There is not one national conservative Station that uses broadcasting. Millions of Americans don't have cable or internet or can't afford it, so they solely rely on  broadcast TV.",Timely_Car_4591,2025-04-28T12:12:34,-2
"Gotta love how today's talking point is how much his polling has slipped since the inauguration, discounting the fact that literally every president inevitably experiences a post-inauguration slump and that he's *still* outpolling Democrats even with it.",DatTrumpDoh,2025-04-28T10:41:44,1

"Dude, smart phones are literally everywhere. Even the lawn workers have their phones out watching videos while they work these day. There are programs for people living in poverty to get free smart phones and internet.

"Fox news doesn't use public airwaves.  This isn't about MSNBC, it's about ABCâ€™s ""World News Tonight,"" ""NBC Nightly News"" and ""CBS Evening All use public airwaves.  got love getting mass down voted for knowing the difference between broadcast and cable tv.",Timely_Car_4591,2025-04-28T11:46:24,9
What did Biden do that was worthy of positive coverage?,paperwhite9,2025-04-28T11:58:27,-7
"Depends more on demographics, a lot of older Americans including my parents struggle with learning how to use it. I know another family member that had to choose between rent and cable tv. She would make too much for those programs. Some people might just want to save money and choose lower data plans and living with just using broadcast tv .    Anyways that's half my point, it's still our air waves too. We have a right to demand fair use. Spectrum is a limited, they don't have right to it all.",Timely_Car_4591,2025-04-28T14:39:31,-4
"Is this the same Fox News that had Chris Wallace rig their debate for Biden in 2020? Did thse ppl miss all of Trump's posts going after Fox News for their pro democrat reporting? Anyone who actially watched Fox News would know that they regularly help democrats and especially the anti-Trump establishment in their reporting, and are routinely dishonest to that end. Their Sunday shows are the absolute worst. It's only the five and their evening shows that even come close to the ratio of the democrat networks. Fox News is way more pro dem anti-Trump than MSNBC and the rest are pro republican or Trump and it isn't even close.",day25,2025-04-28T12:53:18,3
He made it so medical debt under $500 cannot be put in your credit report and existing dings were removed from credit reports.  Trump has expanded on that so that no medical debt can affect your credit. I don't know if it shows up on the credit report. Does anyone know?,pcm2a,2025-04-28T12:34:40,4
"The article isn't about cable news, it's about broadcast news. I don't know how many times I have to say this. The article clearly states it.   "" ""Just 100 days into President Donald Trumpâ€™s second term, >>>>the broadcast evening news<<<< landscape is even more lopsided than it was eight years ago, when Trump was besieged with relentlessly hostile coverage,"" researcher Rich Noyes wrote.

Wow. That was the reach of all reaches ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. Totally balances out him trying his best to debase everything good about our country while running it into the ground and almost starting WW3.,paperwhite9,2025-04-28T22:45:40,5
The other user (who had their comment rightfully removed) was the one who brought up cable news. My point is that even if you bring it up it still doesn't help the democrats because it actually supports our point. Fox News is not even remotely close to a shill for Trump like the other networks are for democrats. In fact Fox News regularly sounds like they have TDS in their reporting..,day25,2025-04-28T15:06:31,5
It sure is and it was the only thing I could come up with. I was banned for three days for asking that question. Sensitive mods.,pcm2a,2025-05-01T14:34:18,1
