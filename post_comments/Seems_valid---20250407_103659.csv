Your comment is either ignorant of all of this or intentionally dismissive because you'd rather see the world through very narrow, less complicated lens.   On inflation, again it's complication. Both Trump and Biden implemented massive government stimulus because of supply chain issues related to the pandemic. It seems like you're more aware of the those which many on the left acknowledge.

"According to WaPo, six times (see excerpt below)  In July 1991, Trump‚Äôs Taj Mahal filed for bankruptcy. He could not keep up with debts on two other Atlantic City casinos, and those two properties declared bankruptcy in 1992. A fourth property, the Plaza Hotel in New York, declared bankruptcy in 1992 after amassing debt. ...   Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts filed for bankruptcy again in 2004, after accruing about $1.8 billion in debt. Trump Entertainment Resorts also declared bankruptcy in 2009, after being hit hard during the 2008 recession.  As a former New Yorker, allow me to enlighten you regarding the ethics of many New Yorkers, including Donald Trump. Namely, a significant minority of New Yorkers believe that stiffing a business' creditors and escaping the amassed debt is good business. And, in Trumpian ethics, that the stiffed creditors are, of course, ""losers and suckers.""  No doubt Trump also considers George Washington a loser for owning up to cutting down that famous cherry tree.
