A mother having no choice but between leaving her two year old with ICE agents while she gets deported or taking the child with her isn’t a choice anyone should have to make. At 2 a child and mother usually have an incredibly tight bond. It’s like taking the sun away for a child’s mother to be suddenly gone from them. They can’t understand. It’s life long damage. If she had the option to hand the child to Dad and if the country she was going to was actively dangerous on landing then that might be the better of two incredibly shitty options but kids have been lost in ICE “care”. I would never be able to hand my toddler over to them.,Limberine,2025-04-27T16:38:13,23

">[According to The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/04/26/us-citizen-children-deported-ice/), the three children were from two different families, ages 2, 4 and 7, and deported early Friday. Their lawyers said “both families were taken into custody while attending routine check-ins this week in New Orleans as part of the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program, which allows individuals to remain in their communities while undergoing immigration proceedings.” They were then taken to Alexandria, Louisiana, a three-hour drive from New Orleans, and put on a flight to Honduras, all while preventing any communication with any members of their families.  Human rights violations abounding in America right now. Yet, it feels like no one is doing anything about it. Things are only going to get worse if people just don't stand up and fight back against it.

Also, if you want to take emotions out of it, deportations are still a problem because they cost money and resources that could have been used somewhere else.
