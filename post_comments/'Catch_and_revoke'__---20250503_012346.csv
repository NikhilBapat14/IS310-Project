"I think this response is very true and worth highlighting:  > David Bier, director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, called the new policy ""absurd"" and contrary to U.S. immigration law.  > ""Wealthy, skilled people with other options will not settle in a country where their lives can be ruined for a speeding ticket or operating an illegal lemonade stand,"" he said in a post on X.",ClaroStar,2025-05-03T03:09:51,52

This gives way too much power to law enforcement. Also how long before it becomes a protection racket.,geekstone,2025-05-03T13:00:14,3
"By now, most non-citizens have already left the filthy, stinking, burnt out pile of shit that used to be something called America. It just took one hundred days. Only ones left to throw out now are citizens. Or as Trump likes to call them, the ”radical left” people = Enemies from within = People who watch cnn or msnbc = People who are not of German Nazi pedigree = Poor people.",Worksnotenuff,2025-05-03T01:40:40,-2

"You're vastly over-estimating how many asylum seekers, green card/visa holders, and permanent residents have the resources to leave. How many people can't return safely to their home countries? How many have nowhere else to go? I think, like... people with the means to, with safe places to land, sure.

"My wife is a permanent resident alien. Green card if you must. For a quarter century. She has a house, children, is on the PTA board for the second time, etc etc etc.  She kept her citizenship in no small reason for this, the ability to happily flee to somewhere else or not be traveling on a US passport when we're being dickbags.   But she's lived here longer than she lived in Canada. This is where her life is so she does not wish to flee, but to make THIS country not ridiculous.",shoobe01,2025-05-03T21:02:54,2

"Yes on me being provocative, but a question mark on what constitutes a ”country” or ”nation” – if not its constitution?   The (drawn up) borders, laws and rules IS America. Neglecting the documents is upheaving the US. History has proven more than once that cultures can be eradicated by new politics. So whatever your ”feeling of being an American” is, it’s already gone if you start to get rid of every immigrant. The US was called the New World because it was made up of immigrants.   The battle of what the US is, is occurring right in front of our eyes, and millions are suggesting that sheer force should replace law and the order of the constitution.",Worksnotenuff,2025-05-03T04:28:19,0

"At the end of the day it's a binary outcome and these actions were one of Trump's major campaign promises. Anyone who supported Trump very knowlingly voted for this.  That being said, the Cato Institute was refreshingly not pro Trump from my brief web search, and didn't endorse a candidate.  https://www.cato.org/commentary/yes-trump-disqualified-office  >THE EFFORT UNDERWAY IN SEVERAL STATES to use Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment to disqualify Donald Trump from becoming president again raises a variety of legal, moral, and political issues. But fundamentally it comes down to this: liberal democracies often have good reason to bar from positions of vast power people whose track record shows them to be a threat to democracy itself, or to basic liberal values. Section 3—originally enacted to bar former Confederates in the aftermath of the Civil War—is a useful tool towards that end. And Trump epitomizes the sort of person who should be barred, for both legal and pragmatic reasons.",PinchesTheCrab,2025-05-03T14:00:10,1
