"So honest question.  What if I illegally entered another country such as Canada, Germany, or any other one?  I assume I would be detained and placed in deportation proceedings.   Pretty sure I just couldn't refuse to leave and have my case drag on for a decade and still get to walk around.  If you're here illegally, it shouldn't take years to have a hearing.  Are you present without being lawfully admitted or inspected?  Are you a USC?  Can you derive citizenship from USC parents, etc...?  And heavily scrutinize all the BS asylum requests and not get hearing set 5 to 10 years out.",theycalllmeTIM,2025-04-20T10:26:54,13

"A member of Congress may be voted out of office.  The President can be voted out of office, or in extreme cases, impeached and removed.  The remedy for a lawless judge, according to John Roberts, is nothing.   Judicial supremacy has run out of control. Trump must end it.",vampirepomeranian,2025-04-20T12:50:33,-3
"It's just an injunction. They've remanded lower courts for improper injunctions, but it looks like the Supreme Court is now going to finally rule on whether the AEA is applicable and for the duration that they're considering this the whole process needs to stop in case the admin is ruled against. It seems unlikely they'll rule fully against the administration, but they might require specific hearings for the determination of gang status rather than relying on other court proceedings.",cplusequals,2025-04-19T17:14:53,63
And the invaders and far left are down voting you.  The numbers prove you're right on target.  Badge of honor my friend.,vampirepomeranian,2025-04-20T12:55:32,6
