Or for that matter, people who couldn't even maintain such a job.  These are the same people who belong to the wealthiest administration in US history. People who prop up unelected plutocrats and billionaires, who go on indiscriminate firing sprees, who represent modern day robber barons, who don't give a shit about the working class.  And yes, the same people who have been crippling the labor movement for decades, busting unions, redistributing wealth to the top, cutting taxes for their rich friends, benefactors and massive corporations.  People who have been perpetuating economic and income inequality for years, who have refused to address stagnant wages, who have been installing corporate cronies into positions of power within the labor relations board where they have destroyed the power of unions, rolled back worker's rights, catered to employers, special interests and corporations, shifting the balance of power away from employees and towards exploitative business owners, and all while making life more difficult for those very same factory workers that they pretend to care about.",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-04-29T16:32:13,9

"Sounds like a pretty crappy dream, Lutnick.  Also, factory jobs suck and always have. Factories are not pleasant places to be. They are loud and hot and stressful and dangerous, and many factory jobs absolutely destroy your body and leave you in pretty rough shape when you get older.  And the only reason people like the idea of factory jobs is a) they are generally open to people without college education and b) in the 50s many of them were union jobs and thus had good pay and benefits.  In other words, it has nothing to do with the factory at all. Rather, it is about being able to make a decent living without having to go into debt for college.  We don't need to make people work in factories to accomplish that. Also, merely working in a factory doesn't ensure any of that -- automated factories will likely require specialized training for the fewer human jobs that is going to be just as limited and burdensome as college, and non-union factory jobs are pretty close to hell on Earth (child labor, mangled limbs, shit pay for backbreaking shifts, toxic exposures, and more -- just read about factory conditions in the 1800s and early 1900s and it will become very clear how bad it can get).",helmutye,2025-04-30T02:13:58,2

"Lots of issues here.   1.  Reagan admin overturned regs that agreed corporations from purchasing their own stock.  Outcome:  instead of investing in factories, employees or R&D.   Essentially our labor that results in profits is shared with investors versus working families.  Wealth gets channeled through Wall Street versus main Street.   2.  US corporations turned their backs on the manufacturing innovations developed during WW2 after the war.   Boards and execs desired more profit and shareholder value versus quality.  We sent one of the key architects of WW2 productivity to Japan after the war as an insult to both Japan and W Edwards Deming.   Toyota embraced Deming much to the detriment of US automobile manufacturing.  3.  US corporations embraced and exploited cheap labor offered by offshoring.   Global consulting firms convinced corporate boards that shareholder value would improve by hollowing the lower levels of the organization through outsourcing.  4.   US Fed Govt used to fund a ton of pure research via DOE which was then transferred to private industry.   Most of the tech we take for granted and through this channel...   Those programs were strangulated forcing other countries to host the talent and facilities that are starting to allow other countries to leave the US behind  ( My POV?  No other country in the world is as entrepreneurial as the US.  We can get this back quickly)  5.  Continual cuts to education funding eliminated student enrichment programs like band, industrial shop and other programs that allowed students to develop a wealth of skills that served communities and employers  Balance has to be brought back and accountability to future generations is imperative.
