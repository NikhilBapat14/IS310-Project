Well yeah that was one of the main issues in the election.  Poilievre failed to pivot so now it’s Poiliover.  He kept after the culture war and woke.  People got tired of that real quick.,Shelby_the_Turd,2025-05-02T05:48:31,12
Well we showed you what happens when you elect a shitty leader.,Impossible-Owl-66,2025-05-02T06:39:20,5

"The Canadian election was as much about voting Trudeau out of power than voting Poilievre into power. Once Trudeau resigned and was replaced by an intelligent, capable alternative, in Carney, the tide began to shift. Trump should get a healthy share of the credit, for sure, but there were other factors that played a huge role in the turnaround.",biscuitarse,2025-05-02T08:21:59,4
"This is such a shit take.  Canadians reconsidered their priorities in light of external threats. Then, Canadians chose to come together on response to those threats, and voted in solidarity with our country and our people.  There is something incredibly perverse about Americans trying to take credit for that. ",sylbug,2025-05-02T13:41:53,3
What? I’m American. I don’t vote in the Canadian elections. People are dumb.,Randy_Watson,2025-05-02T06:32:07,-1

"It's actually kinda true; when Mangollini started the threats to our sovereignty it united pretty much the entire country. The conservative candidate neglected to speak up or pivot because he got the position by ousting the last guy for not being a far right nutter, and he didn't want to alienate his base of maple-MAGAts. He was 99.999999% guaranteed to be the next PM with a majority government until your president opened his greasy pie-hole.   Granted he tried to hit us with the reverse psychology and claimed he wanted Carney to win once he realized how radioactive his fascist bullshit is to us, but he forgot we still have an education system up here and most of us aren't that stupid.",DoktorPete,2025-05-02T06:48:21,5
Fair point. I guess I just find it weird to take credit for something like that because it appears to be as a cautionary tale.,Randy_Watson,2025-05-02T06:56:01,2
