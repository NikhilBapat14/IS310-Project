"The [Federal Emergency Management Agency](https://www.wired.com/story/fema-isnt-ready-for-disaster-season-workers-say-hurricanes-fires-floods/) (FEMA) is making significant changes to how it will respond to disasters on the ground this season, including ending federal door-to-door canvassing of survivors in disaster areas, WIRED has learned.  A memo reviewed by WIRED, dated May 2 and addressed to regional FEMA leaders from Cameron Hamilton, a senior official performing the duties of the administrator, instructs program offices to “take steps to implement” five “key reforms” for the upcoming hurricane and wildfire season.  Under the first reform, titled “Prioritize survivor assistance at fixed facilities,” the memo states that “FEMA will discontinue unaccompanied FEMA door-to-door canvassing to focus survivor outreach and assistance registration capabilities in more targeted venues, improving access to those in need, and increasing collaboration with \[state, local, tribal, and territorial\] partners and non-profit service providers.”  FEMA has for [years](https://www.fema.gov/blog/devastation-recovery-first-30-days-after-hurricane-sandy) deployed staff to travel door-to-door in disaster areas, [interacting directly](https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20241106/fema-field-assisting-flood-survivors-door-door) with survivors in their homes to give an overview of FEMA aid application processes and help them register for federal aid. This group of workers is part of a larger cadre often [called](https://www.fema.gov/about/glossary/disaster-survivor-assistance) FEMA’s “boots on the ground” in disaster areas.  Ending door-to-door canvassing, one FEMA worker says, will “severely hamper our ability to reach vulnerable people.” The assistance provided by workers going door-to-door, they say, “has usually focused on the most impacted and the most vulnerable communities where there may be people who are elderly or with disabilities or lack of transportation and are unable to reach Disaster Recovery Centers.” This person spoke to WIRED on the condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to the press.

Good idea.  I think we should end FEMA. Regions can band together to pool funds to address emergencies.  I live in New England. I am good.  I seriously don’t want to send a penny to the south. Let’s start here. New England states should not send the percentage of taxes that go towards FEMA.  The other states can go it alone or work with like-minded states in their region.,WithMaliceTowardFew,2025-05-05T14:50:47,2

Like, no one cares about that. We want to make sure people can register,” Washington said. “You have to understand, when we go out here in the field, we don’t have security detail.

"That's a *terrible* idea. Ending FEMA will result in far worse federal disaster response that individual states (and even smaller sets of states) will be unable to make up for; FEMA exists for a good and important reason.

That’s great except you live in the United States. If you want to succeed from the Union give it a shot.

It doesn’t work that way   That’s exactly what Trumpers say. We don’t get enough or we don’t want  to follow the federal laws.   I live in Florida which has become Red after all the boomers and S Americans and Cubans relocated here.  We receive 1/2 the Fed Aid per Capita Mass does.  New Hampshire also gets more Fed Aid than Florida.

"It could but not necessarily.    We had a civil war last time because one side left and the other didn’t want them to.  What happens when one side leaves and the other side is happy to let them go?  In scenario two that could be war but wouldn’t be a civil war.  In that scenario the confederate side already left and couldn’t make it.  I they attacked it would just be a regular war.  However if they can’t make it on their own, assuming they have the resources to wage war on a neighbor is a stretch.  We will still have our own military, we will be the ones aligned with NATO.  The “South” would be in an inferior position surrounded by enemies.  We’d probably have to deal with their terrorism (like we do now anyway) but war would be unlikely regardless of how desperate they get.",Richfor3,2025-05-06T08:18:49,1
As a whole blue states carry red states which your own link shows.  That isn't to say every blue state does the carrying and every red state needs to be carried (just most of them).  By the way there's an updated one from 2025....  [https://usafacts.org/articles/which-states-contribute-the-most-and-least-to-federal-revenue/](https://usafacts.org/articles/which-states-contribute-the-most-and-least-to-federal-revenue/)  And as lately as 2022 Florida was a taker state too.   [https://www.axios.com/2025/02/12/states-money-federal-government](https://www.axios.com/2025/02/12/states-money-federal-government)  [https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2025/02/24/federal-state-funding-balance-of-payments-map/78547523007/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2025/02/24/federal-state-funding-balance-of-payments-map/78547523007/)  There's exceptions to the rule as there are with most things.  New Mexico is generally near the top of the taker list.  Utah is consistently on the giver list.  However just looking at the maps you see which states are more dependent than others.    You'd think Republicans would support ending this redistribution of wealth.  They have plenty of bootstraps to pick themselves up by.,Richfor3,2025-05-05T15:39:40,4
"NH $4.3 billion    FL $58.8 billion  Sounds like it's time for Florida to pull up some boot straps and do their fair share.   >In 2021, Montana led the states with the highest proportion of federal funding to the overall budget at 31.8%, followed by New Mexico (30.7%), Kentucky (30.1%), Louisiana (29.8%), and Alaska (29.0%).  >Another way to evaluate reliance on federal funding is on a per-person basis, where federal funding is represented as the average amount a state receives per resident to better illustrate the extent of federal support relative to population.  >Using this metric, Alaska had the highest rate of federal funding in 2021 at roughly $8,628 per person, a whole 26.5% more than the second-highest state, Rhode Island, which received $6,821.

"First of all that's not even what your link says.  New Hampshire received $4.3B and Florida received 58.8B.  58.8B being larger than 4.3B is not complicated.    From there it shows what percentage of the revenue comes from federal funding.  What it doesn't show is how much they paid into the federal pot in the first place.  For that you need to look at the revenue contributions section and surprise surprise, it's dominated by blue states.  In fact, 4 states (NY, California, NJ and Washington) had a bigger support deficit than the rest of the states combined.",Richfor3,2025-05-05T15:50:15,2
It can work this way though. Trump has routinely denied blue states aid and fair treatment.  I think we can start the process of returning to a confederation or secession.
