"I’m not sure the idea of a “coalition government” even makes sense in American politics. The United States doesn’t form “governments” at each election like Parlamentary systems do.  As I understand it, parlamentary legislators are usually voted for by party, the party then chooses what actual human to stick in the seats they’ve won, and that human is then usually bound to vote in accordance with that party’s policies. Then you need a majority (either one party majority or a coalition) to agree to work together to appoint all the Ministers (including Prime) that form the actual Execitive that does stuff.   In the U.S., the parties don’t technically exist, every legislator is elected as an individual, and thus they can (and do) “break ranks” and vote against their party whenever they feel like it.  And the Executive is voted separately, so no majority is required in the legislature. The Senate is supposed to confirm all the Secretaries that run the individual departments, but somebody as always “Acting Secretary of Whatever” (and generally taking orders explicitly from the President) until the Senate get around to confirming the President’s nominees. No majority among parties is required to get these guys confirmed though, even with no majority you just have to convince enough individual  Senators to vote for each guy (and it doesn’t have to be the same Senators in each case). So the President usually just finds someone who appeals to enough individual Senators, or there are behind the scenes deals to pass legislation particular Senators want in exchange for voting in the guys the President nominates.  If somehow a third party gained a significant presence in our congress, not having a majority in the two legislative houses would create some weird procedural issues since right now we assume there is a “Majority Leader” and “Minority Leader”, and committees and such are supposed to have members of “both” parties, but the Constitution doesn’t recognize the parties anyway so they would work it out somehow. Again, you just need to get a majority of individual legislators (not parties) to vote in each change that needs to be made, and voting together on one issue does not in any way create the expectation that you will always vote with that “coalition” on other issues. So everything would just move through eventually, in small pieces, with different and ever-shifting “coalitions” making deals with each other. There would never be a formal agreement to form a “government” and always vote together on everything.  The Vice President used to be the runner up of the Presidential election, but we amended that hundreds of years ago and now it’s technically a separate election, but in practice the same party that wins the presidency is also going to win the vice-presidency. The VP’s only real power is breaking tie votes in the Senate, anything else they do is just whatever the President feels like delegating to them.  As for changing our system, I think most of my fellow Americans erroneously think the 2-party system is how it is supposed to be. At best, they are resigned to thinking it can never be changed. Even among those of us that would like to change it, I don’t think we all agree that going to a proportional system is the way to go. So there is no real movement toward proportional , or anything else, right now.",MPMorePower,2022-08-03T18:08:47,5
"If there was a significant third party that gained enough seats in one of the houses of congress to deny any party a majority, you could see a type of ""coalition"" This would not be a formal coalition like in a parliamentary system, but rather a deal between two parties to distribute officer titles and Committee Seats amongst those two parties, and to agree on a common legislative agenda.   It would not be as impactful or enduring as a ""coalition government""",loselyconscious,2022-08-03T22:05:55,2
"We’re not a parliamentary government. A third party would have to secure seats in Congress and vote with members of either of the two major parties to achieve a majority vote. At least I think that’s how it works. A bill requires a majority of some kind. So, bipartisan bills are sort of like a coalition.",Zealousideal_Mix4250,2022-08-04T06:45:02,2
"In a very technical sense, the US already DOES elect coalition governments. Coalition governments only mean that folks with different priorities and platforms are sharing the same banner for the sake of governance, compromising with each other on some aspects to provide a solid governing majority for the other issues. Well, both parties already have multiple ""wings"" with clearly different political priorities. In the Dems this is especially visible as you see the Progressives, with their ""party"" headed by the Bernie Sanders and his unique platform, and the Moderates, with their ""party"" headed by Joe Biden and his unique platform (which is the one the coalition adopted).  Party size and amount is determined by your government structures, but ultimately more or fewer parties still tend to operate in the same basic way. This is a variation of Duverger's Law, which states that SMDP (Single Member District Plurality) voting leads to a 2 party system. For the same reason this is a law, 2 party systems are essentially big tent coalitions that are pre-sorted and multiparty systems from 2 coalitions along the left-right spectrum. Most voters in the modern understanding of democracy seem to find the latter to be a much preferable system, but the whole point of a 2 party system is that it is much simpler and still achieves basically the same outcomes. 2 party systems aren't bad if you look at them from a certain perspective.  But I think you're misunderstanding the Framers a bit. It's true that they did hope there would be a certain level of national spirit or patriotism that would rise above politics, and to be fair, it was mostly true *for them*. Of course, when you start and armed rebellion against the world's most invincible super power and win and then create a whole new democratic system of governance it tends to build a greater than normal sense of things being bigger than simple politics. But within only a few cycles of the Constitution we started to see the Framers realize this wasn't a sustainable expectation.  For example, look at the VP example. You're right on the expectation, but you also have to keep in mind that the same Framers realized almost immediately that this doesn't work in any contested election and the minute Burr and Jefferson had to work together in the same administration, this format was changed. *Hamilton* gives us part of Washington's farewell address where he addresses that he ""committed many errors"" and this is the sort of thing he was talking about. The Framers did not profess to be perfect in their structures and indeed did recognize that there were things they hoped would work in a certain way and didn't.  The other big example here is parties. Lots of folks love to talk about how Madison and Washington warned against parties. That's only partly true. Initially, they did. But both of them then went on to found the earliest political parties in the US and were instrumental in creating the 2 party system. *Hamilton* is right that Washington wrote his farewell address in response to Jefferson's resignation--his comments about party aren't that parties are bad, as Washington had already created the Federalist Party. Rather, his comments about party were to suggest that *a party other than his* is bad and that you should ""stay the course"" created by Washington's party. The Framers realized pretty quickly that politics will be political. They often talked about it not being that way in the same way that we today talk about ""bipartisanship"" and Manchin was telling Fox News that this new bill ""isn't a political bill, it's an American bill."" You're just buying the political spin of the 1800s.  That said, there is a robust amount of governing that is non-partisan. That's the purpose of the bureaucracy. Sure, the heads of most state agencies are political appointments that are sort of directly partisan (Powell may not have been a registered Rep, but he was DEFINITELY a Rep and definitely political). But the staff of the State Department is mostly folks that get appointed and serve for many years, across many different presidents, often spanning both parties. The big boss is political and changes with the electoral outcomes, but the core of these agencies really doesn't, and they do a lot of day-to-day governing.   But all that really comes down to is that non-department heads don't really have the ability to set policy. For example, look at the State Department folks that testified against Trump in the first impeachment. Most of them had been in their roles for decades, and we heard from quite a few ambassadors to Ukraine whose job was to communicate and advocate for stated State Department foreign policy goals. Whatever Fiona Hill or the bow tie guy's personal opinions were didn't matter, because what they needed to support or advocate or criticize or ask for or push on or whatever was determined by their boss. So they just did those things.   The reason the State Department in this case rebelled against the President was that they felt he communicated in such a way that stated State Department priorities were made less important than Trump's personal political goals. So these folks, that were entirely non-partisan, raised flags and concerns not because they found Trump's personal political goals bad, but because for the first time in their careers they were asked to contradict themselves for political purposes.   The idea that government should be non-political doesn't make a lot of sense. What most people mean when they say this is that they want a government to be non-controversial and to operate by consensus. Any time there is still disagreement about what our public policy should be, it will always be political. But that's the glory of voting: we know there is disagreement, and we put it to a vote, and then we act on that vote.  The reason most folks are finding this to still be frustrating and not resolve the problem is because our system isn't respecting this principle of votes matter. We don't have a majoritarian system, so often even when we vote on it, that doesn't make the way forward any clearer. That leads to understandable frustration.  The UK does this better in that they have majoritarianism. They have a unicameral system without division of powers and no supermajority requirement, so when they have a vote, it matters. This allows for them to have more wiggle room in parties because their votes matter without having to get a ridiculously overlarge majority to compensate for the lack of majoritarianism. If we want a 2.5 party structure like we see in the UK, we need to change our structures to support majoritarianism like the UK does.",mormagils,2022-08-04T09:20:35,2
"The short answer to your question is that the transition to a proportional system would really only take an act of congress and action from the several state governments. However, the two major parties right now benefit immensely from the SMD FPTP system and so have little incentive to change it. In addition, you probably wouldn’t get a ton of support from Americans at large without a sustained public education campaign which emphasized the benefits of the new system (and even then it might not be enough, people don’t like change).  Second, if there was ever a viable minor party (e.g. if proportional representation became a thing in the US), then you could see very similar behavior to what you see in coalition governments elsewhere. What I mean is that for example, if Republicans or Democrats held 45 senate seats and 200 house seats and the Green party held 7 senate seats and 25 house seats, then there is a totally reasonable scenario where the Green Party agrees to vote in line with the sitting President as long as their chosen candidates are confirmed as maybe Secretary of Energy and Director of the EPA. The major difference between this hypothetical US coalition government and coalition governments in the real world is there is no way to force a vote of no confidence and remove the President (as you would a Prime Minister elsewhere). In short, there is a world where the US has a government which resembles coalition governments elsewhere, but it’s not an exact comparison.   (Quick caveat: I used the Green Party as an example because it was easiest to associate with government appointments. If a viable third party were to emerge in the US it would likely be regionally based like the Bloc Québécois in Canada).",WannabePhD211,2022-08-03T23:10:06,1
"No.  Because the US system is a Presidential system, not a Parliamentary system.  Therefore, even if an independent were elected, it would still be one person in charge.  Coalition governments are in Parliamentary system where parties have to get to a majority to form a government.",chitowngirl12,2022-08-04T09:34:24,1
"The Democratic Party is essentially a coalition already. In a parliamentary system Joe Manchin and Ilhan Omar would not be in the same party - look at the wrangling necessary right now to get all Democrats on board with certain bills. Repubs are essentially a monolith at this point but one could argue it’s a similar situation, like the Tories going into coalition with the DUP or something in the UK.",abolishpatreon,2022-08-05T16:10:22,1
You don't think the same is true of Starmer and Corbyn? No way they should be in the same party.,BarryTownCouncil,2022-08-05T17:00:36,1
