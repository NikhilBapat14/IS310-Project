I hate that he cuckoo-birded the Doge meme so much. It used to be a cute funny meme and he turned the word into an hellish shithole phrase wreaking massive pain and suffering into humanity. What a sad disgusting legacy he’s leaving the world,Front-Lime4460,2025-04-28T09:11:17,3
"Elon Musk’s expansive portfolio of companies could avoid more than $2.37 billion in potential legal liability due to his unprecedented influence over the US government, a new Senate report finds.  The figure comes from a report assembled by Democratic staff for the Senate Homeland Security permanent subcommittee on investigations (PSI) probing the impact of Musk’s closeness with President Donald Trump and creation of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) on his financial interests. The staff endeavored to quantify “the financial impact of President Trump’s delegation of power on potential liabilities and scrutiny facing Mr. Musk and his companies.” To do so, it calculated the legal exposure The Boring Company, Neuralink, SpaceX, Tesla, and xAI could face as a result of federal investigations, litigation, or regulatory actions pending as of Trump’s inauguration. The staff called the number “a credible, conservative estimate.”  The subcommittee found that Musk and his companies were subject to 65 “actual or potential” actions across 11 agencies as of Inauguration Day, and said they were able to estimate potential financial liability for 40 of those. That includes up to $1.19 billion for Tesla’s allegedly misleading statements about its self-driving features, $281 million for Neuralink’s allegedly misleading representations about its risks, and more than $630,000 in fines for SpaceX allegedly evading rocket launch requirements, the Democratic staff claims. Many of the agencies that regulate Musk’s companies have been targets of cuts by DOGE.
