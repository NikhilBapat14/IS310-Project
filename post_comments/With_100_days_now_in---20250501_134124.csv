"Is it the general feeling in Florida? Because it's not what I see from here, up north.",NorthenFreeman,2025-05-01T13:51:04,2
"Ironically I'm in the northeast now. I grew up in Florida but couldn't take it any longer so in my 50s I left, the nutters took it over for now.  Used to be a nice place but now it's full of crazy people.",fence_sitter,2025-05-01T13:56:58,3
"I'm from Quebec, now in the west, and what I see in the news is that snowbirds are leaving because, yes, it's getting a bit crazy.",NorthenFreeman,2025-05-01T14:01:14,3
"The environmental situation in Florida is also getting petty dire, most of the state is low-lying swampland and it's very exposed to hurricanes so the flood risk is massive. Even if the people were lovely I wouldn't want to own property there.",pervocracy,2025-05-01T14:57:38,3
"I remember a news I've read a year or more ago... The dude got his 9mm Glock to shoot lizards on the backyard of his house.  Like WTF, obviously bullets ended up in neighbours backyard too...  I can't imagine a worst place than Florida.",NorthenFreeman,2025-05-01T15:17:54,2
