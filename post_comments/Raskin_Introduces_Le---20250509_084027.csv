Retailers need to just do it anyway it’s in their best interest. Transparency is good. It shows that it’s Trump‘s tariffs not a greedy retailer.,odelicious82,2025-05-09T09:28:50,48
God this would be awesome. But never survive a veto,Fit-Tumbleweed9946,2025-05-09T09:15:43,57

It will get zero Republican support. Let’s not forget that this is what Republicans want for America and are currently actively supporting.,yorapissa,2025-05-10T09:52:13,1
We need transparency as to how much of this Russian traitor is causing average american. Get him out of the White House now. Elmo rigged the election was there any election audit? No. The Democrats are feckless and irredeemable at this point.,Ging287,2025-05-09T14:36:38,1
I figured retailers wouldn’t want to because then they can raise prices more than they need to and blame it on the tarriffs,tchnmusic,2025-05-09T09:57:42,12
"I don’t think the goal is to pass this, it’s to goad republicans into trying to make it illegal to show the tariff costs",shallow_kunt,2025-05-09T15:08:44,1
"GOP controlled House will never allow this bill to be voted on.  If they did, then the GOP controlled Senate would ignore it.  So it would never pass Congress and thus trump would never need to veto it. But I agree that he would veto it.",VanceKelley,2025-05-09T10:52:34,17
I am sure customers will see that prices have gone up substantially. My husband remembers prices so he will know how much stuff has gone up. I wish I had that skill. I wish we all did.,sweetfaerieface,2025-05-09T16:41:15,2
"Spent about $5k before May 1st, buying everything I need for the next couple of years.  9 pair of shoes for my son, basically his shoes for the next 2 years including soccer cleats, indoor, atheletic shoes.  Clothes, household stuff, the list is long.",Aman_Syndai,2025-05-09T14:18:41,3
"What I thought of was if a retailer puts the tariff amount .. it will be divulging what their markup is .. since the tariff is based on the cost of the imported product, not what it is then resold for. I don't think they'd want to do that. It's going to screw with consumer confidence either way.",uknow_es_me,2025-05-09T10:16:11,8
Agree. ,Fit-Tumbleweed9946,2025-05-09T19:34:47,1
"Sure, but they’ll blame the stores for raising prices, rather than Trump for adding a big tariff cost to everything",02K30C1,2025-05-09T16:48:38,3
Probably but some of us will realize what it is. Not sure what will happen because nothing has yet.,sweetfaerieface,2025-05-09T16:50:41,0
