"Appointments can be very important, especially judicial appointments.",piratecody,2022-11-15T10:55:51,75
Yes. There’s also the obvious danger of them joining sides with republicans on legislative issues.,tysontysontyson1,2022-11-15T11:39:15,33
Because a few Blue State Republicans might actually vote on the Democrats side.,stewartm0205,2022-11-15T12:24:18,14
"Judicial appointments and the fact that the “majority” in the House of Representatives is declared each time they are in session. What that means is, in theory, if just 2-3 Republicans (depending on how many seats they get above the 218 majority point) don’t show up, then votes can be held with a dem majority.",DankrudeSandstorm,2022-11-15T12:07:42,8
"For things like judges or political appointees it still matters. Sinema and Manchin has different priorities and for several appointments Manchin blocked one, while Sinema voted for them, or vice versa.  Additionally even if Republicans take the house it’s going to be like a 2-4 seat majority with like a dozen kooks, so if the Senate holds the line it will give them a massive advantage in negotiations.",Karatekan,2022-11-15T15:12:12,3
"I don’t think that’s much of an issue anymore for most people.  > The next two years is most likely going to be a bunch of bland neo-liberal bills being passed bipartisan, some judicial appointments and a fair amount of idiotic house bills the republicans put forward dying out of committee.  > And a few executive orders and a bunch of Supreme Court bullshit stripping away more rights from citizens and giving them to corporations.  > It’ll be a great time for establishment republicans and democrats, as they want the exact same things economically.",HaveCamera_WillShoot,2022-11-15T13:45:28,3
"Don't know why the GOP would want to stop the Dems agenda. It has help our economy so well, so far, it seems like the GOP would want to continue down the prosperous path we're on?",dstang67,2022-11-15T14:50:56,-3
"Manchin and Sinema are the only 2 democrats who don’t support ending the filibuster. In order to abolish the filibuster democrats needs support from atleast 7 republicans as well as Manchin and Sinema in order to end the filibuster.  Also yes you are right with a GOP controlled house, house republicans are most likely to block anything that comes from democrats and Bidens agenda. A GOP controlled house will likely launch damaging investigations into Bidens administration and his family like they did to Obama.",StevenB_06,2022-11-15T19:52:55,1
"Et tu, Brute? When Julius Caesar was stabbed to death, that was part of a much broader plot against him. But when his buddy Brutus was the one who sealed the deal, Caeser took that more personally because he wasn't expecting betrayal from folks he thought were his friends.  Simply put, the Dems don't have control over their enemies' behavior. That's what makes them enemies. Of course losing the House is a bigger deal, but it's pretty reasonable for the Dems to be more frustrated about folks within the party blocking what they CAN do than about the other party doing what is expected.",mormagils,2022-11-16T08:44:53,1
Has Manchin blocked a single Biden judge?,ReElectNixon,2022-11-15T12:38:28,20
"That would only work for a single one, not both. Also they still have the presidential veto.",turriferous,2022-11-15T12:12:37,9
"Yes, but the majority leaders in both chambers aren’t going to bring legislation to the floor if they don’t like it. Right?",GhostalMedia,2022-11-15T12:27:26,6
"Ummm Schumer controls the Senate floor.  Absent vote-a-rama amendments, it’s pretty hard to roll the majority in the current legislative process.",ReElectNixon,2022-11-15T12:39:53,4
"Senate requires 60 votes to pass anything the house sends them. Appointees are sent by Biden, not the house and in some cases can approve with simple majority which they have and these two have not stopped a Biden appointee yet.      I don't see what danger there is of them joining republicans without 9 more of their democrat colleagues doing the same, and then Biden not using Veto.",cbt711,2022-12-14T12:51:52,0
But the house majority leader still needs to bring the bill to a vote. That’s going to be the bigger obstacle. Right?,GhostalMedia,2022-11-15T12:26:05,5
When has that stopped them from obstructing in the past?,GhostalMedia,2022-11-15T15:37:12,2
But then the Democrats would get credit for it. They last thing they want is to help Biden get re-elected.,TheFairyingForest,2022-11-15T15:00:54,2
"What’s the benefit for the Dems to remove the filibuster now? The previous point of removing it is to pass more progressive legislation in the Senate.   But now more progressive legislation won’t get picked up in the house, and if the GOP retakes the Senate in 2 years, they’ll be able to pass more conservative legislation with only 50 votes.   Ideally, the Dems would have wanted simple majority voting early in Biden’s presidency. Then they could have passed voting rights stuff to ease disenfranchisement and make it easier for them to remain in power.",GhostalMedia,2022-11-15T20:41:09,1
"No, he hasn’t.",That_Guy381,2022-11-15T19:30:53,15
"I’m not sure what your first sentence means. As for vetos, you’re right. But presidential vetoes tend to cost political capital. They should be avoided if at all possible.",tysontysontyson1,2022-11-15T12:16:45,2
It’s a lot less of an obstacle with such a slim majority for McCarthy. It doesn’t take many members in swing districts to pressure him by refusing to vote for legislation he does support and wants to bring forward.   Votes are going to be crazy over the next two years. Individual votes may come down to who is in attendance that day (there’s rarely ever 100% attendance in the house across all 435 members).,MrKahk,2022-11-15T14:55:45,6
Funny thing. The speaker of the house is an elected position so he doesn’t have to be a member of the majority party.,stewartm0205,2022-11-15T17:04:35,1
"No, my understanding is that any member of the House can call for a vote on a topic, it doesn't necessarily need the speaker's blessing, unlike the Senate.",Riconquer2,2022-11-21T19:28:49,1
He's clearly being facetious or is just a troll.,InitiatePenguin,2022-11-15T16:55:55,1
"Oh there is no IF the gop most likely WILL take the senate in 2024, the 2024 senate map just looks to good for republicans, democrats will be defending senate seats in states like Montana, Ohio and West Virginia which isn’t good news for democrats they will have to compete in normally red states in a year that is most likely going to favor the gop especially if someone like DeSantis becomes the republican nominee for president.  The best thing democrats can easily do the next 2 years is solidify their gains in states that are trending towards them like Arizona or Georgia and expand in those states. However I don’t see a real reality where democrats keep the senate past 2024 they would have to keep Ohio, Montana and West Virginia while defend in a number of other swing states.",StevenB_06,2022-11-15T21:08:24,1
You suggested that buffer in the senate could stop Sinema and Manchin for creating legislation with Republicans. This would work for 1 of them at 51 v 49 because 1 moving over to 50 50 would give Harris the tie breaker. But if both moved over that would be 49 v 51.   I dont think there would be any cost for Dark Brandon vetoing Republican malarkey. On the flip side Biden would welcome bipartisan legislation that was good. That's Biden's whole deal. Work together in good faith.,turriferous,2022-11-15T12:35:42,7
"I suggested the exact opposite. If there is a 51-49, Manchin and Sinema still matter because they could align with Republicans. I’m still not sure what your first point was. I’m well aware of Harris being the tiebreaker if one of them, and not the other, switches teams on an issue.  I’m all for Dark Brandon everything. The political capital I was talking about wasn’t his supporters… they/we love him going full Dark Brandon. I’m talking about the behind the scenes Capital at the… Capitol (pun intended) and for legitimate independents.",tysontysontyson1,2022-11-15T13:41:31,-3
That's exactly what I said.,turriferous,2022-11-15T13:57:19,1
"I know. But, you said it as if that somehow conflicted with what I said. I’m just not sure why you’re pointing out the obvious. No one is disagreeing about the splits.",tysontysontyson1,2022-11-15T14:00:27,1
"But I am contradicting you. I'm saying that danger you mentioned hardly exists. Only in the case of a single flip. And even that ""danger"" is probably wholly curtailed by the veto at one end and the genuine desire for bipartisanship from Biden at the other end.   The other people's comments focusing on appointments and buffering the next election cycle were a lot more valid. Your initial comment reason wasn't very meaningful or realistic.",turriferous,2022-11-15T14:29:44,3
Well Biden would veto the Manchin/Sinema/GOP bill. But they also _wouldnt_ pass the democratic equivalent bill.  So that specifically wouldn't be a danger but the actual result is democrats don't pass their bill either. Which is also bad.,InitiatePenguin,2022-11-15T16:52:33,1
