"I'm sure there's brigading, but there are also a lot of conservatives that are supportive of Ukraine. They were invaded by Russia unprovoked and their land stolen and their people killed. If that's not the classic bully beating on a weak person that we're all supposed to be against, I don't know what is.    I want the war to end too and since Putin isn't playing ball, I'm all for Trump's suggestion a couple months back of getting Russia to the table by ""arming Ukraine to the teeth"". When Russia loses big chunks of their seized territories, it's likely Putin will decide it's better to end it before losing more.  When there's so much angst at Ukraine, it feels as if we are just supposed to be against them because the libs are for them. I just stopped commenting on the anti Ukraine posts because I'd get downvoted into oblivion. Much like saying anything mildly moderate in a lib dominated sub against their hive mind.  Don't forget that the $60B funding package for Ukraine was passed by an awful lot of conservatives with strong support from their voters. There's a lot of folks that probably just stopped debating previously but that are happy to chime in when there's a thread they feel they can actually discuss the topic in without being instantly shut down.",NyJosh,2025-04-27T17:32:26,763
I’ve been constantly pro Ukraine the entire time. But not blank check levels. I like the idea of transferring expired but still usable weapons and munitions as well as allowing Ukraine to buy newer equipment with funds raised from Europeans. They should be funding this 75-85%,CCCmonster,2025-04-27T18:03:46,613
"I’ve had the unpopular opinion of arm Ukraine from the beginning.  Yes, I don’t like sending tax dollars over there.  But anyone who can chip away at Russia IMO, is worth it.   I may be jaded by the 22 years I served in the Navy.  But Russia has never been our friend.  From Cold War, to present.  And especially under Putin who has for decades he has been for open about his desire to rebuild the iron curtain.   They had a chance to join the free world 34 years ago.

"I support President Trump, but I have never been supportive of his position on Ukraine for three reasons: 1.) I don’t trust Putin. 2.) Appeasing Putin with land concessions will only lead to more Russian wars in the future. Those of you who have heard of Transnistria know what I’m saying. 3.) China will view the USA as weak. They will gamble that the USA will refuse to send troops if they invade Taiwan.  Trump should lead a NATO force to remove the Russians from Ukrainian territory. Putin will threaten to use nuclear weapons. Trump should call his bluff and threaten to wipe a Russian city off the map if he does.  The Biden/European plan to just throw money and arms at Ukraine and hope that the Russians will get tired and leave has been shown to be a failure. Ukraine put up a good fight, but they can’t win a war of attrition. If the Europeans were really serious about defending Ukraine, they would have organized a coalition of armies to engage the Russians directly. Instead, they want to blame Trump for Ukraine’s situation.  I wish we didn’t have to go to war with Russia, but I don’t see a better option for a lasting peace.",John_481,2025-04-27T18:45:43,62
"I've always supported Ukraine's right to self determination.   A decade ago, it was the idiotic left that supported Russia. Conservatives saw Russia for exactly what it is, a totalitarian dictatorship. In fact, Obama even mocked Romney on the debate stage for calling Russia ""America's greatest geopolitical foe"".   However, just like on the left, there are also idiots on the right. The problem is back when Obama was president, Trump wanted to discredit him so he said that Putin was a better leader than Obama. This started some kind of affection in Putin for Trump, who then returned the kind words.   This created an idea amongst the left that Trump and Putin were somehow colluding to rob democrats of their political power. And then, after Trump won the election, the left in their refusal to accept Trump's victory, clung to a lie of collusion between Trump and Russia.   Furthermore, as it was revealed that Biden's son was getting huge paychecks from Ukraine in return for connections to his vice president father, it created a sense of animosity and distrust of Ukraine for conservatives.   Now, despite Ukraine trying to fix their corruption and move towards freedom and democracy, there's a contingency of lesser-intelligent conservatives who have been duped into thinking that Ukraine is bad and Russia is right. It's absolutely silly.",Serpenta91,2025-04-27T21:27:32,36

"This community as a whole leans further left than most Conservatives. Partly because it's Reddit, so just the sheer brigading of leftists either lurking and downvoting stuff they disagree with or just outright posing as Conservatives (which is absolutely real, I've seen people with Conservative flairs on this sub calling Conservatives every name in the book on other subs) causes the general opinion to be weighted to the left.  Also partly because Zelenskyy and Putin are both quite stubborn and both have shown to not want to concede much of anything, making a peace deal rather difficult to negotiate. DOGE is hugely popular among Americans, especially considering the economy has been in the shitter for awhile and hearing that we're sending more and more billions to Ukraine in aid just pisses people off even more. Also also, the more elected officials call for further indefinite funding, the more suspicious it looks considering everything that DOGE has revealed in the way of government funds that were supposedly being used to support foreign nations.",Wesdawg1241,2025-04-27T17:46:03,2

At the end of the day - the US is not the piggy bank of Ukraine. As long as Europe pays Russia for energy and other commodities, their involvement in ‘helping’ Ukraine is a joke. The US is not even an ally of Ukraine and up until not too long ago, it was one of the most corrupt countries in that hemisphere (I still feel like with no accounting of the money that was given to Ukraine - there is still corruption there).   I don’t like Zelensky. For him to bring up Crimea as part of the peace deal shows that he is not serious about achieving peace - he just wants to be able to declare himself THE winner.

I am not pro-Ukraine and never have been. The issues that took many folks over look is what was happening before the last major ceasefire was broken. Most likely by Zelensky's forces.   What has happened is birddogging of American conservatives under the old cold war knee jerk reaction. What folks don't want to deal with is the why Russia invaded the first time. Why did Obama and the EU turn a blind eye to the mass murder that was happening in Donbas and Crimea? Why was Zelensky used as a funnel to get weapons to other countries that made agreements with the US and EU politicians for the economic advantage of a very small amount of people.  Then the rather interesting elections in Ukraine that saw a lot of folks declared enemies of the state and Bishops removed and jailed.   Ukraine is part of EU imperial expansion and one might want to remember that the current president of the EU is the daughter of the Nazi political officer. That Zelensky has strong ties with the Open Society and has been proven to be aiding in funneling illegal immigrants into the EU.  I strongly suggest folks do some serious research on all of the history behind this current conflict and not just that which fits a preferred narrative.,MJM-TCW,2025-04-28T15:47:29,1

"Why do you feel that conservatives who support Ukraine have ""bad takes""?  Is your opinion the only ""correct"" one?  Look, Russia was the aggressor here. Ukraine has every right to defend themselves. Russia has been our enemy for 70+ years now. And with good reason. The Russian government will ignore any agreement or treaty at the drop of a hat when it's no longer convenient for them or when they perceive that they can achieve some advantage from violating it:  [https://thehill.com/opinion/international/4443781-history-shows-that-no-ceasefire-or-treaty-with-russia-can-be-trusted/](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/4443781-history-shows-that-no-ceasefire-or-treaty-with-russia-can-be-trusted/)  Russia is *not* our friend. They ally themselves with dictatorships like China, North Korea and Iran because those countries all operate along similar lines. A ruling oligarchy that considers their own citizens to be an expendable resource.  Ukraine has done a fantastic job of dismantling Russia's ""Second most powerful in the world"" military.  Putin has been forced to pull World War II era tanks, APCs and artillery pieces out of USSR mothball storage yards where they've been rusting away for decades just to have something to fight with.    Ukraine has now shown the entire world that Russia's military was powerful on paper only.  They can't even take over a bordering nation 1/10 their size after three years of trying.  I feel that we should continue our support for Ukraine.  Even if we ignore the [multitude of war crimes committed by Russian troops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crimes_in_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine) (which we shouldn't), and the 13,000 civilians killed / 30,000 civilians injured so far, we are seeing the decimation of Russia's military might for pennies on the dollar.  A lot of what we have sent to Ukraine is 2nd tier hardware that was languishing in storage depots because it had been superseded by newer equipment.  Some of it was even slated for disposal and donating it to Ukraine instead saved us money.  The only way that Russia can learn its lesson from starting this war is if they're sent packing back home with nothing to show for it but worldwide sanctions against them, a depleted military and a wrecked economy. Maybe in a few decades, if they behave themselves and pay to repair all the destruction they caused in Ukraine, the world can discuss trading with them again. But not before.",MildlyBemused,2025-04-27T19:30:35,63

"I support Ukraine also. Many of us remember the Iron Curtain.  My ancestors emigrated from communist Ukraine. My grandmother would send care packages to our relatives. At 14 she asked me for my older and worn in Levi jeans. At the time, 70s, it was fashionable to wear jeans with the torn/worn knees, ala Ramones. I gave her a few pairs to send.  She had to read me the thank you letter as I did not speak/read Ukrainian. My cousin thanked her and myself profusely for the most generous gift of the jeans. They sold them on the black market for an amount of money that allowed them to skip food lines (overpriced and usually half rotten food from the USSR government) and eat fresh bread every day and non moldy meats 2-4 times a week. We were in tears.  I showed her how to quick age Levis with rock salt and a few rinse cycles in the washing machine. She upped her care package frequency and supported many in the family for years with them.  I remember the one thing they had a hard time sourcing, even with the extra cash - guitar strings. Dean Markley's were about $6.00 a set back then and I always added a set or two to her packages.  No one there wants a return to that.",goat-head-man,2025-04-28T09:18:59,41
