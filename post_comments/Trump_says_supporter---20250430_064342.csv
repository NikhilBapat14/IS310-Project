You want to be safe, protest smartly, not destructively. Start getting the word out.  3) Make good trouble. Gum up the works.

In addition, every single reputable economist world wide said it would be terrible for Americans. Trump supporters literally did not care because the nuances of tariffs and taxation were too difficult for them to understand, no matter how simply they were explained. There were no nuances involved in the bigotry - that was plain and clear and out in the open. So they chose Trump and hand waved away the parts of his promises they did not understand.

He was a big Trumper. He's a trucker and was very big into politics. He had a Trump flag on his flagpole that was so big it made the pole sway in the breeze. I kinda worried that it might fall over.

There’s certainly many that fit the stereotypes…but there’s so much more than that. And in my opinion, acknowledging that is a key step in moving forward. And buying MAGA.  One of my examples would be when I went home to CT last year. Was once a liberal town, now MAGA. When I was there though I was struck by how very little had changed in 20 or so years…the only change was everything looked older and worse. It’s a city where both major factories have closed. Crime has skyrocketed (which coincided with it going from like a 95% white city to now around 65%). Schools now ranked like 3/10. Etc. And I don’t agree in the slightest, and I realize there’s a multitude of factors that led to the declining livibility, but I looked around, spoke to people. And I had to grudgingly admit….i see why Trump’s message was appealing. It’s true most were high schooler educated individuals, but I think it was less about ignorance and more so desperation for many.
