He's such a swell guy. Every year my co workers pool our donations to buy toys for kids and a large portion happens to be dolls for the girls. I'm sure Trump means all toys when he referenced dolls so this year we will only be all able to buy for 40 kids instead of the 200.,bellboy718,2025-05-03T17:50:45,1

"True, Americans buy way too much crap that we don't really need and soon send off to the landfill. But Trump's not surgically collapsing the sectors of the economy that keep warehouses stocked with trinkets and tchotchkes made by third-world slave laborers; he's just collapsing the economy, period. We're not up in arms over the prospect of kids getting two dolls instead of thirty. We're up in arms over the prospect of kids getting two meals instead of three, because that's what's coming down the pike. Trump soft-launching austerity signals very dark times ahead.   Suggesting poverty as an antidote to obesity is pretty wild, by the way. In the US, the poorest people are the most likely to be overweight, and elevated food prices will only exacerbate this, because the cheapest and easiest food is the crap that's full of fat and sugar. The condition needed to create an inverse correlation between obesity and poverty would be actual famine, and you get that we don't want that, right? ",tinfoil-sombrero,2025-05-03T09:10:41,5
