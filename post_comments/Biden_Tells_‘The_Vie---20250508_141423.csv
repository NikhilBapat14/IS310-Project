Biden was a good man at the wrong time. He should have gone to the wall hard on Jan 6 crew and thrown the book at anyone on the right preaching sedition. He should have focused on Russia as a direct and visceral threat. He should have replaced the attorney general from the get go. He should have announced his successor by his second year and planned to step down. He was an old school neo-liberal Democrat in a world that is clearly moving past that ideal. He was an old school Senator operating by antiquated rules based on personal integrity over naked wealth and power.,hamsterballzz,2025-05-08T15:03:20,15

"No. This is *mularky*. I want Biden to come out and say not just ""I take responsibility."" like a manager would for an employee making a mistake, but come out and admit that his pussyfooting around whether he should run again or not is what cost the Dems the majority of the election. ""I was in charge. He won. So I take responsibility,"" is just this fuckstick trying to act like he's still a leader in charge of something, and not that he's at fault entirely and completely. Sure there were dozens of other smaller things that helped chip away at the blue vote, but it ultimately comes back to his decision to run a second time and then his decision to drop out so late in the cycle. None of the other issues would have mattered at all if he just kept to his word, you know, like a leader would, and kept it to a single term. He did a decent job while in office, but by the time Trump's term is up none of it will have mattered.

But Trump gets to be president for it because the media is diarrhea and defending it makes you shit too, actually.",normalice0,2025-05-08T14:56:28,7
I would encourage you to take a good look at the media environment these days. It’s impossible for democrats to win when every outlet lies for Trump nonstop. If you don’t recognize it then you have no idea what’s going on.,Cautious_Finding8293,2025-05-08T20:09:44,1

Minimum wage has nothing to do with this.,luri7555,2025-05-08T17:50:39,2
"Just like the big federal government, there’s other layers of government at the state and town level. Those governments can also set a minimum wage. That’s why the minimum wage in Washington, DC is $17.50, for example.

"Bernie was popular among demographics Biden underperformed with against Trump (namely White Men and Latino voters). And there were polls that showed Bernie performed better against Trump than Biden. This also happened in 2016 as well:  https://fair.org/home/polls-showed-sanders-had-a-better-shot-of-beating-trump-but-pundits-told-you-to-ignore-them/  The “too liberal” comment means nothing because no one agrees to what “liberal” means in America. I’m from a deep red state. I’ve met plenty of MAGA voters that like Bernie because he simply “doesn’t talk like a politician.” People have a deep hatred towards shiny, establishment politicians, especially within the Democratic Party. For many, “liberal” just means “Democrat”. Bernie is an Independent. For many, he naturally isn’t going to read as “liberal” because he’s not as embedded in the party that the vast majority of voters despise.",Bloo95,2025-05-08T23:30:05,2

The thread is about Biden’s accountability for the role he played in trump 2.0. You didn’t address that which is probably why you are downvoted.,luri7555,2025-05-08T20:00:36,4
"Yep. The Democrats usually talk about policy in very annoying technocratic ways. An example: “I will fight to increase the number of Pell grants available to first generation Black college students attending HBCUs!” That’s… too detail-burdened and turns the mission of improving college affordability into a race issue. Just saying, “Every American deserves a right to education, so we will make public universities free by taxing billionaires to afford it,” is much clearer and is much more unifying. It also benefits all Black people. I’m Black and did not attend an HBCU. Simpler policies are more attractive, simpler, and more inclusive.",Bloo95,2025-05-09T13:32:39,2

I’m not saying you are wrong. Just that votes on Reddit usually favor replies that advance the conversion about a post. In this case i think it came across as anger at other voters despite Biden’s acknowledgment he played a part in this disaster. They are only downvotes. I get them all the time.   I think Dems need to show more accountability to win bank the middle. I like hearing it. They should have put that menace in a cell 100 feet under New York and a lot of people are mad at them for not doing it. That’s my two cents.,luri7555,2025-05-08T22:54:25,1
