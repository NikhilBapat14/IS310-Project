"I don't think I've ever witnessed a president be so singlehandedly responsible for destabilizing the global economy.  It's also no surprise that Trump is trying desperately to blame these outcomes on anyone or any*thing* else but himself and his own actions and policies.  And policies, mind you, that damn near every economist warned us about. It's not like these were wild predictions either.  Current estimates show that a recession is around the corner, with real GDP growth for the first quarter coming in negative at -2.2 percent.  When Trump caved on his ""liberation day"" tariffs, he claimed that dozens of countries were coming to the negotiating table, when in fact, the current administration is struggling to make deals with these other countries, including Japan, one of our largest trading partners.  And let's be clear here, Trump didn't back down because these other world leaders were ""kissing his ass,"" he backed down because his policies are reckless and ill conceived, while he was likely being pressured by his advisors to pull back on some of these damaging trade policies. And by pressure I mean that his closest allies were probably pleading with Trump the same way a parent does when they're trying to get their child to eat vegetables.  No, these countries aren't kissing Trump's ass, they're being alienated and some are even being forced to take a harsher stance against the U.S. In other words, Trump is welcoming retaliation, which actually has the opposite intended effect when it comes to reducing the trade deficit.  And what's worse is that as Trump continues to escalate economic and diplomatic tensions between us and these other countries, they are being incentivized to turn to China! And believe it or not, China has their collective shit together and can weather the storm a hell of a lot better than we can.  And this has also turned out to be a massive failure because before Trump upended global trade, the US was in a much better position to economically isolate China!  This point needs to be emphasized over and over again. China's economy has expanded and grown at an exponential rate over the years. They have the means, the population, the resources, the bureaucracy, the workforce, etc, to win a trade war against the US nine times out of ten.  Now, keep in mind that Trump has still imposed sweeping tariffs on a wide range of goods, products and services from dozens of countries, while he continues to escalate matters with China one day, but backpedal on his policies the next.  He obviously never learned his lesson from last time. Because not only did Trump start a trade war with China during his first term, which led to harmful consequences for American businesses and consumers, but he also managed to increase the trade deficit at the same time.  But his supporters will tell you that this time it's different, even though he failed to balance the trade deficit last time when our tariff policies weren't as sweeping and haphazard as they are now.  They'll also explain that this is just all ""part of the plan"" to force other countries to start treating the United States ""fairly.""  Yes, the United States—which has spent the last several decades making itself the centerpiece of the current global trade system—is now the victim of the system it helped build in the first place.  I've come to realize that this talking point—which Trump uses to justify his reckless trade policies—is merely a broader representation of the right's insistence that they are being constantly victimized by the powers that be. Except in this case, it's on a global scale.  That being said, none of this has kept Trump's spokespeople from going to bat for him, claiming that he's playing ""3D chess""  while lying to Americans about the long term effectiveness of his ""genius"" policies. ""It's all part of the plan."" What plan? You've shown us that there is no immutable plan here, that there is no certainty or stability whatsoever, and that the current administration is entirely untrustworthy.  This is all while Trump continues to make allies of enemies and enemies of allies as he fails to follow through on his ""day one"" promises.  In fact, it appears that Trump is more interested now in readmitting Russia back into the international club, than he is committed to negotiating a peace between Ukraine and its land grabbing enemy, nay, *our* enemy.  And yes, the flagrant hypocrisy of Trump and his supporters has been on full display these past few months.  Where in the past they used the stock market, CPI data, consumer confidence, price increases, Fed announcements, etc, as major metrics for indicating that a democrat president was doing a terrible job with the economy. But this time around, they're bending over backwards to defend Trump while trying desperately to rationalize why poor economic trends and ominous predictions about where the economy is headed are no big deal.  What's worse is that most of the economic issues we faced under Biden were a direct result of the global pandemic and its reverberating shock on the economy. On the other hand, most of the economic issues we have today are the direct result of one man's actions.  And Trump is such a vindictive, insecure, pretentious idiot that he doesn't realize, nor does he care that his rhetoric and actions are having the opposite intended effect on the economy. He doesn't realize that threatening to fire Jerome Powell will force markets into a tailspin. He's even gone on national TV and admitted that he ""couldn't care less"" if businesses raise their prices!  All those people who claimed they voted for Trump because he's a ""businessman"" don't realize that Trump is indeed running the country like he does his businesses, straight into the ground...",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-04-27T23:56:03,122
Because EVERYTHING that crook says is a lie.,Administrated,2025-04-27T22:49:33,29
The negotiations are happening inside his shrinking brain. He is either so desperate that he has nothing else but complete and utter bullshit or has lost the last vestiges of his tenuous grip on reality.  Exports to the US only comprise 3% of China's GDP. It can afford to sit tight and demand that tariffs be lifted before any trade discussions take place.  Rare earths give it the same influence as OPEC in the 1970's and the oil shock plunged the US into recession. That the US is already in economic recession gives China the whip hand.  Expecting to bully China into a trade deal was the height of arrogance and stupidity.  Once tariffs are lifted China can respond with trade discussions which demand a free trade agreement with the US. It will reach an agreement which makes Trump's trade war a complete failure.  Other nations are most likely sitting back in wait for this nonsense to collapse.  Trump cheats at golf and nations of any standing play chess.,iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-04-27T23:02:01,28

I’m sure the Republican base is convinced that trump has gotten great trade deals for America from all this tariff shenanigans, once again proving himself to be an expert negotiator.

"As per [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-tariffs-trade-negotiations-china-b2740393.html) 📰:  - Donald Trump’s chaotic approach to the U.S.-China trade war took an odd turn this week, with the president claiming that trade negotiations are happening every day, with Beijing responding that they have no idea what he’s talking about.  To recap, the United States has put an import tax of 145 percent on Chinese goods coming into America. As inventories already in the country deplete and new stock arrives, Americans can expect to pay more for products or find shelves unstocked.  China responded by putting a 125 percent tariff on U.S. imports. Officials warned other nations striking trade deals with Trump that there will be consequences if they come at the expense of Beijing’s interests.  The president has softened his rhetoric over the past week — saying he planned to be “very nice” to reach a deal, calling the current tariff on Chinese goods “too high” and vowing it would “come down substantially.” This came after a meeting with major retailers who are believed to have sounded the alarm over what the tariffs mean for their businesses.  Nevertheless, no formal talks with China appear to have either been arranged or have taken place, no matter what Trump claims.  On the Sunday morning talk shows, Trump Cabinet members were asked to clarify who was talking with China.  Things did not get any clearer.  ABC’s Martha Raddatz asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about China on This Week. He began by explaining that the Chinese business model is selling cheap goods to the United States, and if that were to suddenly stop, they would be forced to negotiate.  “President Trump, again, said he’s spoken to President Xi of China, and negotiations are ongoing, but China has firmly denied this, saying that China and the US have not consulted or negotiated on the tariff issue,” Raddatz said.  “So are negotiations actually happening? Who is talking?”  Bessent replied: “This was IMF, World Bank week, in D.C., as you know, and I had interactions with my Chinese counterparts, but it was more on the traditional things like financial stability, global economic early warnings.”  He continued: “I don’t know if President Trump has spoken with President Xi. I know they have a very good relationship and a lot of respect for each other, but again, I think that the Chinese will see that this high tariff level is unsustainable for their business.”  “Why would they deny the negotiations?” asked Raddatz.  “I think they’re playing to a different audience,” Bessent replied.  “So they’re actually going on, there are actually things happening, but the Chinese are just denying that it’s not true?” Raddatz asked by way of clarification.  “We have a process in place. And again, I just believe these Chinese tariffs are unsustainable because of the Chinese business model,” the Treasury secretary reiterated.  Turning to another Trump statement that trade deals could be arranged with multiple countries in a very short space of time, Raddatz asked about a timeline for an agreement with China, noting Bessent has told Bloomberg it could take two to three years to forge a comprehensive deal. At the IMF meetings, he called it a “slog.”  “Well, look, I think that there is a path here. So the first will be again a de-escalation, which I think the Chinese are going to have to have. Then I think there can be an agreement in principle,” he said, saying that other trade talks were following a similar trajectory.  Raddatz also pressed Bessent on Trump’s claim he’s made 200 deals on tariffs: “Who has he made deals with? Is there actually any deal at this point?”  Bessent didn’t give specifics but said he believed the president was referring to “subdeals” within the negotiations.  He also defended the president’s seemingly chaotic tactics as “strategic uncertainty.”  “Nobody’s better at creating this leverage than President Trump,” he said.  On CNN’s State of the Union, Dana Bash pressed Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins on the alleged China negotiations.  “You said that there are talks with China every day,” Bash said. “Who are the talks with and at what level? Because the Chinese are saying that’s not true.”  Rollins responded: “Well, according to our team in Washington, the conversations are ongoing regarding multiples of trade, but here multiples of the trade goods that are coming out and going in. But, the bottom line with China is this: they need us more than we need them. They need our money. They need our markets. They need our consumers and all of the above.”  She called the president “the ultimate deal maker” working to “hold China accountable.”  “And in agriculture, year upon year, decade upon decade, our goods have been taken advantage of,” she said. “The trade disparity, the non-trade barriers on top of the tariff numbers, are insane, whether it’s Argentina, or China, or Brazil, or the UK.”  On Thursday, He Yadong, China’s Ministry of Commerce spokesperson, said: “Any claims about the progress of China-U.S. trade negotiations are groundless as trying to catch the wind and have no factual basis.”  Similarly, Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said China is prepared to negotiate only under certain conditions.  “China’s attitude is consistent and clear: if you want to fight, we will fight to the end, if you want to talk, the door is open,” he said.  That same day, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office: “Well, they had a meeting this morning, so I can’t tell you. It doesn’t matter who ‘they’ is. We may reveal it later, but they had meetings this morning, and we’ve been meeting with China.”",T_Shurt,2025-04-27T22:37:56,14
Trump is loosing his mind. Or should I say he has already lost it. Nothing he is doing makes a hell of a lot of sense. He is crashing the economy and the dollar. China can stand the pain more than the USA will as the store shelves become empty and the prices for everything skyrockets he will have little choice but to back peddle or face a revolution at home.  He has turned the USA into a world pariah no one really wants to deal with them any more because he has proven he won’t honor any of his “deals”  the world will with great difficulty just abandon trade with the USA until the USA steps up on their terms  not the USA’s terms any more.
