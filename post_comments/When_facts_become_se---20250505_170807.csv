The press has been purchased and then purposely paralyzed.,RoosterMedical,2025-05-05T17:46:59,137
"A few key sections:  >But whether you love him and claim his first 100 days are the best in history as the members of his junk box, err cabinet, claim – or you believe as Michael Cohen (his former fixer) does that Trump’s first 100 days have been a quick trip to hell, we have to come to grips with an unshakeable truth; free speech no longer exists. > >Every positive thing that Trump claims he’s done, he can back up because he’s stifled dissent. Everything his detractors say he’s done to the detriment of the country begins and ends with the same reason. Without dissent, without facts, without the ability to speak truth to power, you cannot have due process. You cannot educate. You cannot inform, and you certainly can’t govern democratically. > >... > >Trump doesn’t like the facts. But does like to have his, ahem, ring kissed. When he was interviewed by ABC’s Terry Moran, he held up a poorly photoshopped photo of Kilmar Abrego Garcia (the Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador) and claimed Garcia was a member of the MS-13 gang. When Moran pushed back, Trump said the reporter wasn’t nice and asked him why he just couldn’t admit it was proof that Garcia was a gang member. > >Facts. That’s why. We need them. Trump does not and doesn’t want us to have them unless he dictates them to us. > >Trump is at his absolute worst when he can’t accept the facts that counter things he has stated publicly. He exploded at the New York Times for that newspaper’s coverage of Trump’s implied threats against CBS’s parent company, Paramount, that led to executive producer Bill Owens of “60 Minutes” resigning. Trump sued CBS last year in a case stemming from an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris that Trump said was deceptively edited. > >The New York Times piece included a comment from correspondent Scott Pelley, who said that Paramount “began to supervise our content in new ways,” and that Owens “felt he lost the independence that honest journalism requires.” > >Trump, of course, now wants to threaten the Times into silence with a lawsuit. > >Seth Stern, the Director of Advocacy for the Freedom of the Press Foundation, said that Trump’s lawsuits are classic examples of SLAPP, “Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation.” > >“SLAPP strategy isn’t to win. The plaintiffs don’t intend to win. The point is to intimidate, to bleed opponents dry, that’s what Trump is doing,” Stern explained. “He can use those lawsuits as bargaining chips against corporations and media conglomerates that have other interests, other business before the government. He is essentially laundering bribery through the court system; file a frivolous lawsuit, demand a settlement. If this was done in a dark alley it would be an illegal bribe, but since a judge signs the settlement agreement, it’s okay – or at least it is so far.” > >There are other examples of Trump’s dismantling of free speech, according to Stern. “We’ve got the weaponization of the FCC under Brendan Carr, an FCC chair who wears a golden bust of Donald Trump as a lapel pin who has pursued all sorts of frivolous threats against outlets from CBS to ABC to NPR to Odyssey-owned radio stations that had the nerve to report on an ICE raid.” > >But nothing compares to how we in the press have failed to hold Trump accountable in the Brady Briefing room. Because the parent companies have fallen in line, most reporters have done the same. Trump asks who a reporter works for when asked a question, and makes a note if he likes or dislikes what comes out of a reporter’s mouth. How the question is asked, and who the reporter works for, could determine whether or not we ever see that reporter in the pool again. > >... > >The Trump administration has successfully infiltrated the corporate media ranks and replaced the most experienced and critical reporters with mostly friendly reporters in the briefing room and in the press pool, or at least compliant reporters. Trump has taken it a step further and is now hosting special press briefings for the right-wing social media (“New Media”) in the South Court auditorium of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. You can imagine what that’s like. It's like the village idiot convention in a Woody Allen satire.  The lack of ability or will by major media outlets over recent years to hold the truth as the highest standard, instead shifting to normalizing or both-siding even the most objectively false statements has in part gotten us to where we are today. They've largely been bullied into submission, and even then many are now being actively sidelined. This administration doesn't want a press, it wants a propaganda arm and for the most part it's been getting what it's wanting. A free and independent press is critical to the proper functioning of a democracy, and its disappearance is yet another canary in the coal mine that things are going very very wrong.",Hrmbee,2025-05-05T17:16:00,38

Trump stifling Bezos is not Trump killing free speech. That was Bezos' decision. Your free speech wasn't killed... You wrote this article. My free speech isn't killed I can say anything I want and I've got two websites of my own to say it on besides forums like this one.    I've repeatedly called Donald Trump a Nazi and his AG a bloodyhirsty ghoul.  I've also participated in seven protests so far saying horrible things about Donald Trump in my posters and no one stopped me.   Now Trump may well kill free speech - he's a fascist so I certainly would expect that will happen sooner or later if we don't figure out how to stop him. But he hasn't done it yet.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-05T20:45:26,0
