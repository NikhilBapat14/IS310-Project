"What?  Not how this works.  These people are already in the app. They're already in removal procedures, in parole programs, or are registered ""asylum seekers"".  All the ""crazy shit ICE is pulling"" is just fearmongering porn to make leftists open their wallets and go back to donate to Democrats. There's really nothing particularly crazy - which is why most ""cause c√©l√®bres"" involve some pretty dubious people.",labegaw,2025-05-05T16:37:59,-2

Honestly thought I was replying to the MAGA poster. I interpreted your comment as them trying to make their point that taxpayers are paying for housing and that it didn‚Äôt matter if the program was state or federal. My apologies.,Rough-Adeptness-6670,2025-05-05T12:10:16,1
"> 16% is for people who believe all undocumented immigrants should be able to stay, even those convicted of violent crimes  That's not even half. And again, that's in the most favorable poll.  >Nonviolent crimes was about 50/50.   Not really dude - you can't even read a poll.  50/50 among those who support some deportations. You need to include the 32% that want all illegal immigrants deported. So it's closer to 60%.   Not really sure what people like you are even trying to argue - good luck for parties that keep running on the extraordinary thesis that the US should be the ONLY country in the world that should allow illegal immigrants to remain.",labegaw,2025-05-06T09:53:55,1
Well documented on crazy places like reddit?  So much overreach should have lead to some successful legal challenges.  What the hell movies or Alcatraz have do to with this? Would you support quotas for movies like European countries do or something?  How does that change the fact these people are already registered and already in the app?  You're just a fanatical partisan filled with anger.,labegaw,2025-05-05T17:47:18,0

"> Google overeach by ICE. Or denial of due process for deportation. It's nothing like being adjusted Reddit. >  >   I googled it and apparently the first example of overreach was the ICE trying to detain an illegal immigrant accused of domestic violence and being obstructed by a judge (who obviously was then arrested and charged for aiding a fugitive) - apparently some people think that executing arrest warrants in court rooms is overreach, even though that's been normal for decades.   The proof is in the pudding - for all those cases, there has so far been a single one where an individual actually had a removal order, but a withholding order wasn't remove previous to deportation.  >And you have done your assignment, I see, but there are currently no European quotas on foreign films.  I don't know if you're dealing with some sort of personal troubles, but that is an insane claim.
