Under Biden we had record domestic oil production and the largest surplus of domestic energy produced vs energy consumed since about WWII.,Reviews-From-Me,2025-05-09T10:12:18,11
Cool story Bro.  Actual gas is still more expensive now than it was under Biden.  Along with literally every other product in existence.    tRump did that!,Richfor3,2025-05-09T11:35:16,5

"Also under Trump, and under Obama, also Bush, and every president since WWII. Oil production has (to my knowledge) not had a year where it was less than the previous.  So, what’s your point by this comment?",Derk_Bent,2025-05-09T12:43:51,-2
"Trump blames Biden for inflation, particularly claiming that Biden cut oil production and that's why we had a spike in inflation.   The fact that we not only had record oil production under Biden, we also had the highest energy surplus in decades. So Trump lied, and he continues to lie in order to justify unnecessary and damaging pro-oil policies by tricking you into thinking it will lower prices.",Reviews-From-Me,2025-05-09T12:52:14,5
"I believe you’re quite misinformed here, Biden did in fact, stop new leases for oil drilling and also stopped the keystone pipeline from being constructed (cross country border permit was denied) which did have an adverse effect on the price of oil. This was expected as he was moving in the direction of green energy.  I’m not sure where you’re getting that oil production and ENERGY surplus directly drives the price of oil per barrel. Could you explain further as to why you’ve come to that conclusion?  EDIT: *oil production and energy surplus*",Derk_Bent,2025-05-09T12:58:53,-2
">I believe you’re quite misinformed here, Biden did in fact, stop new leases for oil drilling and also stopped the keystone pipeline from being constructed (cross country border permit was denied) which did have an adverse effect on the price of oil.  There were tens of millions of acres of federal land that had already been leased out, but hadn't yet even started development. Pausing new leases did nothing to reduce oil producers' ability to extract oil, as proven by the fact that oil production continued to rise and break records, and our energy surplus continued to rise.  Keystone XL had nothing to do with domestic oil production. Furthermore, independent analysis found that the pipeline would have no significant impact on oil prices, and could actually increase prices in the Midwest US, which is the largest region buying that oil currently.   Oil prices did go up at times under Biden, but there's nothing Biden did that would have caused it.",Reviews-From-Me,2025-05-09T13:08:07,3
"I’d like to be home to fully reply to this, but you’re severely oversimplifying the situation concerning oil prices, U.S. involvement and global events that factored into higher oil prices.  I will, for now, simply point out that it is tough to fully examine the effects of Biden policies due to COVID, Russia invasion of Ukraine, and the general global demand of crude oil. With that said, it seems like you simply want to staunchly defend Biden’s policies regarding oil due to partisanship or party loyalty.  Oil prices had NEVER reached over $70 under Trumps presidency, yet after the pandemic and recovery from Russian oil sanctions, the price of oil never dropped below $70 per barrel. It’s pretty safe to say that Biden’s policy had an impact on the price of oil, but not to the extent that people want to believe.",Derk_Bent,2025-05-09T13:21:18,-1
You clearly can't point out any verifiable proof of Biden causing oil prices to rise. You completely disregarded the fact that Trump specifically claimed that Biden cut oil production and that's why prices went up; the facts prove that's a complete lie.,Reviews-From-Me,2025-05-09T14:10:28,3
"Okay, apply the same scrutiny to your position. What *verifiable* proof do you have that Biden did not cause ANY increase to the price of oil?  >You completely disregarded the fact that Trump specifically claimed that Biden cut oil production and that's why prices went up;  You're obviously not reading what I'm writing. I did not, and do not care what Trump said, I'm not arguing that he was correct in the statement that he made. I'm telling you that Biden and his push for green energy absolutely had an effect on the price of oil, just about every news article from 2022-2024 agrees that it was a multi-faceted issue that challenged the global market for oil, Bidens policies did not help.  At this point it sounds like you are just trying to argue about Trumps statement, I didn't give a fuck about that. If you're still trying to argue that Biden had no effect on oil prices, you're just putting your head in the sand for the sake of bootlicking your party affiliation, that's all I have to say about that.
