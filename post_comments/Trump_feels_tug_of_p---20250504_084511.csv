Trump doesn’t care. He’s making billions off crypto schemes. The economy and his polls could go to zero and he wouldn’t lose a second of sleep.,angrypooka,2025-05-04T08:48:36,47
"It is genuinely surprising that it seems like Trump is  actually trying his best to be despised by as many people as possible. Even the billionaire class is beginning to get nervous that they might not be in control of the monster they bought.  I mean the candidate who was as of six months ago was campaigning on lowering prices and reducing inflation is now saying that actually being poor builds character, and kids don’t really need Christmas presents.",bestforward121,2025-05-04T08:57:53,61
"From the article:  >The chaos has shaken the faith of Trump voters who felt that he would at least deliver economic competence and guarantee the bottom line.   Faith and feelings.  This underscores the cult of Trump voters.  Like all cult leaders, Trump is fucking his flock despite their faith and feelings for him.",ResidentKelpien,2025-05-04T08:59:19,17
"At the rate this is going I think the country is in danger of losing the benefit of being the dominate currency. This would hurt in so many ways such as the lower interest rates it gets on that 30 trillion debt payments, the ability to sanction foreign enemies and the money it collects from it's trusted 10 year bonds. Countries are moving away from trading with the US as it's not seen as a reliable partner and is being seen as a country not being ruled by a stable democracy or the rule of law... which is essential to being a trusted monetary economy.",Thund3rbolt,2025-05-04T10:47:32,9

I love articles that say Trump is feeling pressure then as soon as he’s asked he just doubles down on not caring and does the exact opposite of someone who feels pressure (because he doesn’t),d_e_l_u_x_e,2025-05-04T09:56:37,5

"The good news is nobody can fill this orange bag of shits shoes when he’s gone. They will try and eventually use force to push their  shit-ass agendas which will cause Americans to hate  them even more than they already do.

"He doesn’t care because he is doing it on purpose. This is a coup, they are trying to install    Billionaire corporate control over every aspect of your lives.  >He has significantly ramping up arming police with military grade gear.  >Doge is creating dossiers on every citizen to determine who is part of the in group and who is going to get to work in their factories.  >His has reinstated the death penalty and eroded the due process.  >He is going after everyone, including judges, who will stand in his way.  >His goons are gleefully hinting at shocking plans for ‘dealing with’ blue sanctuary states.  >He is making it illegal to challenge ICE or Israels genocide, stripping away your first amendment rights.  >He is installing a religious task force to enforce Christian laws   >He even has a fucking countdown webpage to expire on July 4th 2026, the 250th anniversary of America. Which his EOs have listed all his task forces (doge and Christian enforcement groups) are set to be shut down. Really fucking scary when you stop for two seconds and consider why   >He is also only 6 states away from a constitutional convention to create a new constitutional order, which can easily be achieved once the sanctuary cities are taken over.   And that is only a drop in the bucket of what they are doing.  We are absolutely and truly fucked. Don’t wait for some arbitrary line in the sand to get out of the country. How many people do you think are also waiting for that specific line to be crossed and how many people do you think Canada or England will allow in before they close their boarders?  Canada has infrastructure for 40 million people, 1% of Americans suddenly fleeing the country will cripple their economy and infrastructure.   Run. And run far.

"I think that was the intention all along… he doesn’t care about America, he cares about money. I’m sure he’s heavily invested in whatever currencies or crypto he knows will become dominant",astrozombie2012,2025-05-04T11:42:29,3
"The world still trades in dollars. That will change. The key factor is Arab oil: payment in US dollars only. That isn't a given. Venezuela has the largest proven oil reserves in the world, exceeding those of Saudi Arabia.  Canada is third, followed by Iran.  Venezuela alone (303.3 billion barrels) has over **eight times** more oil than the US (36.0 billion barrels).  Canada (170.3 billion barrels) has **four times** more.  The US is a minor player.  This is a great opportunity for the EU, UK, and others (Canada, Australia, NZ, Latin America, maybe Turkey) to finally realize that the US is not needed for them to function. Together they have more people, more money and plenty of tech, military toys (including nukes) and natural resources – including much more oil - to work with each other - and leave the US outside looking in.  China can be a part of this. Let the MAGAs find out what relying on Russia is like. The US has been in decline for some time; MAGA stuff and moves like this are just a sort of official recognition of that fact. We are the latest second-rate nation on the world scene.  One of the great unintended ironies of all this is that MAGA, instead of making America great, are destroying what made American great in the first place, and in the process are rapidly pulling the US down toward the bottom of the pile.  We are becoming a second-rate nation with nukes. Like Russia.",nogooduse,2025-05-04T19:36:26,2
"""The good news is nobody can fill this orange bag of shits shoes when he’s gone. They will try and eventually use force to push their shit-ass agendas which will cause Americans to hate them even more than they already do.""  Don't be too sure.  Look at Venezuela, where chavismo flowed seamlessly from Chavez to Maduro.  Maduro has destroyed the country.  There's not enough food, no medical supplies, no jobs.  He has wasted or stolen the vast oil wealth (Venezuela has the largest proven oil reserves in the world – more than Saudi Arabia and 8x more than the US), collapsed the economy (leading to about 1/5 of the population fleeing the country)...and he still has a 20% approval rating.",nogooduse,2025-05-04T19:40:02,1

"Yes, it is a fascist coup, but I believe that’s more of the people pulling his strings who are conducting that. Peole like Miller or Putin. He just goes along with it because he’s impressionable (or compromised) and is probably simple minded at this stage of his cognitive decline. he’s also the type of person who easily gives in to his dark urges. That’s why the Soviets cultivated him in the first place. He’s doing exactly what that type of person would do why is completely uninhibited. He’s had a proven track record of saying and doing pretty awful things. Before he razzle-dazzled the rubes with his fake reality show he had a reputation for being an absolute jerk. Now he’s an absolute jerk that had SCOTUS say he’s untouchable. So he’s busy filling his family coffers and giving people the finger, because nobody can stop him.  Edit: I guess the important take away is that getting Trump removed from office will not bring the fascists to a grinding halt. It will damage the movement getting rid of the cult of personality, but there’s half a house and senate enabling this behavior.",P1xelHunter78,2025-05-04T13:06:08,3
