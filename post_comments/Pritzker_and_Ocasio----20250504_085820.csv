"He has near unanimous labor support in Illinois, he vetoed this bill because it was a bad bill that didn‚Äôt have enforcement mechanisms.

Being a politician for the most part is much more demeaning than being a bartender. By a wide margin. AOC is that rare exception to the rule. Maybe it should be mandatory for aspiring politicians to tend bar for a year or two before they're allowed to run.,biscuitarse,2025-05-04T10:52:12,15
It‚Äôs only demeaning if you think being a bartender is demeaning. I‚Äôd suggest the intent of the article title is to highlight the vast array of opponents lined up against 47 - ranging from fellow billionaires to ‚Äúlowly‚Äù bartenders (note the hashes I‚Äôve used around lowly‚Ä¶),Due-Ad-1465,2025-05-04T13:57:23,11
"No it's not. In fact saying that calling someone a bartender is demeaning is demeaning itself to bartenders.   In this context, they are trying to show that two politicians from wildly different social and economic backgrounds are getting together on common grounds.¬†   But you guys are just fixated on the bartender moniker.   This isn't a case where they are trying to denigrate AOC for her bartending background.   People really need to stop having knee-jerk reactions to everything.",dengop,2025-05-04T13:58:47,6
"Corporate media outlet attempting to demean an actual progressive who has gained momentum? Gosh we haven't seen this since... Bernie... or any other progressive in fucking American history.

"Unfortunately, we're seeing the limits of their oaths as they come up against a fork in the road: give up corporate ""donations"" or support the people who voted you into office.

"All that means is the leaders on our side get killed without doing anything that helps us.   Think if more people had vocally stood up to hitler. Would it have mattered? No. They'd just have been executed. The underground resistance actually made a huge difference though. Trump isn't assassinating politicians (yet) but he does terrible things that have the same effect.   Trump also doesn't care about most policies. All he wants is to be the one in charge and to get richer. For example, trump isn't the least big religious. But the far right christian fundies stroke his ego and play his games and he gives them everything they want. Meanwhile liberals fight him and he just sends his goons after them.

"How is doing PR stunts and giving speeches defending the country? It just makes blue states targets for trump to cut funding and stuff.   The real fights are in court and by making deals. Trump is a terrible deal maker despite so desperately wanting to be a legend. People and countries who pretend to side with him make out like bandits.   He's a toddler. Handle him like a toddler. When you have the power you use it in a huge display of force and he hides in shame. When you don't, you have to pretend you're giving in to him and letting him win while actually putting his medicine inside the cookie.",Constant-Kick6183,2025-05-04T17:57:49,-1

Bartender absolutely should be on the list, as well as all of the academic, political, and social accomplishments.   This is not me insulting bartenders, this is me saying that there is more to it.
