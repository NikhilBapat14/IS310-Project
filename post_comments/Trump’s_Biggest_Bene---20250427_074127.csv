"When Jimmy Carter was elected president, he gave up his peanut farm to avoid any possible conflict of interest. When Crazy Donald was elected president, he made a memecoin where whoever buys the most gets his personal ear. He is the most blatantly corrupt president in American history.",dan7315,2025-04-27T08:29:30,38
He's in the White House. He should be in jail.,inthekeyofc,2025-04-27T08:20:12,15
"No kidding! He only ran for president to stay out of prison and make himself untouchable by law enforcement for his crimes, cons, grift scams not to do anything beneficial for America or democracy",CAM6913,2025-04-27T08:28:05,15

No leader in history has been better at fleecing his base than this man. Devoid of any shame he would sell the cutlery at the whitehouse if the opportunity presented.,jimmygee2,2025-04-27T08:34:31,5

The only reason he took the job was so he could scam Americans out of their money. Money and revenge are what motivates him!!,will2828,2025-04-27T17:40:13,3
Wait until he tries to not buy but assume ownership of the extremely valuable government buildings he’s vacating.  Then wait until he personally profits from them.,hereforstories8,2025-04-27T11:07:02,2

"Carter didn't give up the farm or the warehouse business. He didn't even put them in a blind trust.  He put his interest in them in an open trust. He continued to receive trust income, and the trustee was his close friend Charles Kirbo, who was an advisor of his and often stayed at the White House.  There was a Special Counsel investigation into whether any trust funds were diverted into his campaign. The investigation did not find wrongdoing in that regard, but it did uncover that Billy Carter had obtained a large loan for the businesses from the National Bank of Georgia shortly before President Carter appointed Bert Lance, the President of the National Bank of Georgia, to serve as director of the OMB.  Carter also had to bail out the businesses while President, and they were over $1 million in debt by the time his Presidency was over.",tommytraddles,2025-04-27T09:31:27,2

We should have told him he was “going to the big house” he’d think it was a football game and check himself in,P1xelHunter78,2025-04-27T15:22:13,2
