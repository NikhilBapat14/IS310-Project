"Oh. This is sad.    “Before long, Fetterman began repeating himself, shouting and questioning why “everybody is mad at me,” “why does everyone hate me, what did I ever do” and slamming his hands on a desk, according to one person who was briefed on what occurred.”  “As the meeting deteriorated, a staff member moved to end it and ushered the visitors into the hallway, where she broke down crying. The staffer was comforted by the teachers who were themselves rattled by Fetterman’s behavior, according to a second person who was briefed separately on the meeting.”",FawningDeer37,2025-05-07T23:38:38,8583
"> In the 2024 letter to Dr. David Williamson, Jentleson warned that Fetterman was not seeing his doctors, had pushed out the people who were supposed to help him stay on his recovery plan and might not be taking his prescribed medications. Jentleson also said Fetterman had been driving recklessly and exhibiting paranoia, isolating him from colleagues.  This is tragic and unfortunately I assume it’s only going to get worse.",farceur318,2025-05-08T05:05:23,418
"> Before long, Fetterman began repeating himself, shouting and questioning why “everybody is mad at me,” “why does everyone hate me, what did I ever do” and slamming his hands on a desk, according to one person who was briefed on what occurred.  This is alarming, it almost sounds like Alzheimer's rage or something. He's obviously dealing with unmistakable mental decline from the stroke, and not just based on this one incident.  One of his main staffers even noticed it last year:  > Fetterman’s one-time chief of staff Adam Jentleson told a neuropsychiatrist who had treated Fetterman for depression that the senator appeared to be off his recovery plan and was exhibiting alarming behavior, including a tendency toward “long, rambling, repetitive and self-centered monologues.”  Boy, does that sound familiar...  Fetterman continues to indignantly brush off concerns too, so I don't even think he has the wherewithall to consider something like resignation.  I guess I also have to point out that there are a number of congressmen who passed their ""best by date"" long ago. These are also politicians who have been declining steadily over the years, but with Fetterman I think it's all the more unsettling because the change has been so drastic.   There's also the fact that voters feel deceived because they thought they were electing a so-called ""progressive."" But it's pretty evident how some of Fetterman's post-stroke political stances are not what his progressive supporters voted for.",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-05-08T00:32:16,2068

"Posted this elsewhere, will post it here. He **is** the same guy he has always been. Armchair doctors need to quit blaming the stroke. Fetterman is who he always was.  I knew Fetterman before the stroke. I used to run in the same political circles as him. I got downvoted like hell on this very sub for telling people to vote for Connor Lamb and sharing this one important tidbit of wisdom: Fetterman was never a progressive.   He is a political opportunist. Always has been. You know that bullshit story he tells about living in a church basement? Conveniently leaves out that he is a nepo baby and church in question was bought by his father and basement in question was converted into a luxury home.   Fetterman is the ultimate failure of progressives and a reflection of how shallow they can be. Sinema at least hid who she was. Fetterman was always hiding in plain sight. But progressives could not see past the blue jeans and performative hanging of the rainbow flag. They did not want to see beyond that. He was a big guy in a hoody who said “fuck.” And they ate it right up. And are now surprised that he’s who he always was.  People who blindly supported him while looking no further than his outward appearance are using the stroke to justify their own shallow vote. This guy is to progressives as Trump is to conservatives. A grifter who rode the brand. To see people bend over backwards to explain his conduct is as humorous as watching the MAGAts claim Trump is joking about 2028.    And, as with Trump, the information was there the whole damn time. They just didn’t want to see it until the leopard started feasting on their faces. Don’t be a Trumper. Don’t make excuses.

Any human with a shred of decency should feel bad for him on some level.  You rarely see that kind of empathy from the right when someone steps out of line. There’s no room for nuance.

"I’m a neuro ICU nurse, and unfortunately, you see this type of behavioral swing with some degree of frequency in frontal brain injuries and tumors.   Someone may suddenly have a diminished capacity for empathy, may become extremely impulsive, or may be much quicker to anger.   I’ve also personally seen a reversal in negative traits due to brain injury, but it’s a more rare occurrence. My friend’s Dad (not my patient) suffered a traumatic brain injury that he eventually recovered from. Prior to the injury this man was extremely abusive toward his children and spouse. He was also an addict. After the injury he experienced amnesia, and there was almost a total reversal of behavior. Suddenly he was not an addict, and was kind and generous toward his family. He had only vague memories of his life prior to the injury, but remembered his relationships. My friend recounts how jarring it was to suddenly have a relationship with her Dad that was tender and doting after years of his berating and physical abuse.   The family unanimously agreed to not remind him of what he was like before the injury, and they’ve somehow carried on without bringing it up. If his memories returned he’s never admitted it. My friend definitely has residual trauma from their early relationship, but the Dad who did the abusing doesn’t really exist any longer. She had to go to therapy just to work through the strangeness of it.   It’s been years now and it’s bizarre. He and his wife have recovered a happy marriage, and his kids have mostly resumed a good, loving relationship.

Yup. Tough decade here and now I'm feeling it .... Stress sucks,JonathanApple,2025-05-08T07:14:42,6
"Normal response to acute stress:  (such as when you've sustained an injury, have to speak in front of a crowd, or are about to fight or flight with a bear, etc)  stressor —> release of cortisol (+ adrenaline, norepinephrine) —> activation of cytokines (which are pro-inflammatory and can cause cells to apoptos).   When the stressor passes, the cascade fizzles out.  Ever-present stress:  (think chronic pain, PTSD, being in an abusive home, living in a war zone, living in poverty or being on the cusp of it, being incarcerated, homeless, etc)  Chronic stress —> elevated cortisol —> increased presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines —> chronic inflammation —> cell death, organ dysfunction  You can see how the cascade can become a destructive and precarious positive feedback loop if it never gets an opportunity to chill out. Chronic inflammation is a known causative agent of cancer and there is increasing evidence implicating cytokines (inflammation) in ailments of the brain like depression, anxiety, and PTSD. The hypothalamus, which helps regulate perception and mood, is particularly sensitive to inflammatory injury and neurons that die don't come back. This is why people can remain irritable, reckless, and emotionally labile even after the original insult is gone. This is also why psychedelic therapy has had such promising results with ailments like PTSD and addiction: it actively helps induce axonal growth, repairing damaged neural pathways and creating new ones,* restoring hypothalamic functioning.  *Look up psychedelics and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), if you want to learn more.",i_owe_them13,2025-05-08T14:24:44,3

"There is a removal mechanism, which is expulsion by 2/3 Senate vote. Granted that is very difficult to do and has been used very rarely, but that’s by design. It should be difficult.   As for the electorate being able to recall, that is very much against the intention of the Constitution for federal officials. Senators are not intended to represent short-term interests of the electorate, hence the 6 year terms. You could argue it would be good to be able to recall senators like Fetterman but you have to consider the overall impact of having recall as a possibility for Senators, not just in this one case.   Even if we grant that there should be some way for a senator to be removed outside of expulsion, you would want that to be something like a recall rather than a doctor’s order based on mental health assessment. Adding in a desire to remove “narcissists” based simply on a doctor’s assessment shows just how wrong this could go. It seems extremely obvious that this would be abused and would give extreme power to the psychiatrists or someone influencing them.   Bottom line, don’t invent ad hoc methods to remove officials based on individual people who are problematic. It needs to be a very high hurdle.",MukdenMan,2025-05-08T07:11:00,26

"When your brain is damaged, sometimes you will have difficulty encoding and retrieving memories accurately, and this can be accompanied by something called ""confabulation,"" where your injured brain just makes up false memories in order to make sense of the improperly stored or retrieved fragments. The person this is happening to is completely unaware that these ""memories"" are false; they believe that they are remembering actual events that they experienced or witnessed. Sometimes, these events are bizarre or disturbing. Of course, no one else will validate the reality of what they ""know"" happened, because it didn't actually occur. This can make the person who is confabulating feel like other people are gaslighting them and that other people aren't trustworthy, and, of course, if the confabulations include ""events"" where other people did things like steal from them or lie to them, this will worsen the distrust, because now there is ""evidence"" that others can't be trusted.",aculady,2025-05-08T11:32:34,1

"Republican policy is essentially ""oppose anything Democrats support,"" no matter what. Literally all of their strategy revolves around the demonization and opposition to Democrats. They cannot agree anything Democrats support is right. Republican ideology basically doesn't exist any more. COVID was a shining example of this. Operation Warp Speed was carried out originally by the Trump administration and Republicans were initially supportive of the vaccine, but once it became clear this was a topic the Democrats agreed completely on, they had to 180 and be anti-vaccine. Same reason they opposed masking. It was a fucking respiratory virus that is extremely transmissible, of course wearing a mask is the logical decision. It was the most obvious shit ever and had literally no downsides considering you could turn basically any cloth into a mask somehow to avoid affecting availability of proper PPE to medical staff.

Fetterman's stroke also happened a couple days before the polls opened for the Primary. People had already been voting by mail.   Fetterman won \~60-25.   Nationally the news and certain DNC mucky mucks seem to think Lamb is a winner and the future of the party. But he's unpopular in his own state.   His claim to fame is *narrowly* winning in Republican congressional districts, but he nearly lost his ability to do that to redistricting.   And despite complaints about Fetterman more recently, Fetterman still sits to the left of most of the DNC. While Lamb's record is pretty far to the right. He's Joe Manchin Jr. and sells himself as such.   Sounds like exactly what the DNC and nation need to Wolf Blitzer. He's a hip young millennial who's tough on crime, loves financial conservativism and compromising on gun control.  But he's not what human beings are into. And smarter minds were pointing at Fetterman's statewide success and nationwide visibility vs Lambs slip to irrelevance as an example of how that old strategy doesn't work anymore.

"Yes quite. Voting against 52% of them is **literally** voting against most of them.  And there's been [more confirmation votes](https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/legislative/one_item_and_teasers/nom_confc.htm) in the Senate since March 10th. You wanna guess how many of those he didn't vote for? 26/33. **79% No or abstain votes.** And 5 of those yes votes were for mere ambassadors. A number of those votes passed with 70+ Senators in favor too, so he was hardly alone among Democrats.  Regardless, all of these votes were political theater regardless of what Fetterman, Bernie, or any other Democrat did. There were never enough Republican defectors to prevent confirmation of a single one of them (with the exception of Gaetz). There is no way to filibuster a cabinet nomination indefinitely.  Fetterman was totally irrelevant for Bondi's vote (a mere 2 weeks into the administration), and even if she had been defeated the president would have found some other stooge to weaponize the DOJ in her place.  The only way something could have been done is overwhelming popular demonstrations *by the constituents of Republican Senators* that were so forceful as to make some of those Senators believe that if they voted in favor of these nominations that they were guaranteed to lose reelection. A tough sell when many of them still had 4 or 6 years left in their term and would thus assume that their voters wouldn't stay mad about mere cabinet nominations all the way until voting day. And it didn't happen in large enough numbers anyway.",fiction8,2025-05-08T10:32:42,3

At high levels in campaign politics.   You really don’t know your candidate or your elected anymore than the average person knows their boss. You see what they want you to see. Though you spend more time together than the average person spends with their boss, there are boundaries. It is an employee/employer relationship. Do you show your boss your true self? Or do you have a certain persona that you are at work which includes elements of yourself but modified to be professional you? Bosses are no different. If anything they are extra cognizant of staff perception/boundaries.   All to say, it is not uncommon to be in a 4-5 hour flight or drive seated right next to your candidate/elected and not say a word to them. It’s not an intimate relationship in most cases. Even senior staff. Politicians are like any other employer. Boundaries exist. Because you spend so much time together, it is even more important to have disconnect from work and boundaries while there. I’ve worked over 50 different campaigns in various paid roles ranging from the candidate’s handler to general counsel to chief of staff/campaign manager.

Have talked to your neurologist about Botox? Apologies if you have but I suffered from migraines for 25 years and kind of lucked into getting Botox for TMJ and as a happy side effect it completely cured my migraines. I’ve had one migraine in the last 15 years and I thought I was having a stroke or something because I had completely forgotten what a migraine aura was. So now I’m a bit of a Botox for migraines evangelist because I had tried ALL the migraine meds (and a lot of them are seriously heavy duty drugs!) and while they helped reduce the frequency and mitigate the awfulness none of them were really effective for me. I also didn’t realize/appreciate that I had had a massive headache for basically my whole life and I just thought my “normal” feeling was normal. Compared to my migraines it was perfectly fine and manageable but looking back I genuinely don’t know how I managed.

"sort of an oversimplification but sure let’s go with it.  early “liberalism,” if we want to call it that, went hand in hand with strong central government — in which case usually meant an absolute monarch — because they believed only a strong central ruler could curtail the greed and ambitions of the nobility.  so liberalism essentially was a partner to absolutism to counteract oligarchy.  then the philosophical differences started to emerge between absolutism and liberalism in the Enlightenment period when Western fantasies of a “wise philosopher king” ruling over liberal society showed itself to be a fantasy. (if only they had known China had been trying to do the same thing with Confucian philosophy for 1000 years only to keep backsliding into tyranny and civil war every 200 years or so)  thus, you had the modern concepts of conservative and liberal ideology. but even then liberals didn’t as a basic function believe all were created equal. like, remember the concepts that went into the american declaration of independence was that all men - i.e. white, landowning males who presented as cis-hetero in all likelihood — were created equal.  the last 100 years has been about expanding that definition to actually include all.  and if you actually look at conservatives - especially around the world - and i mean conservatives and not the fascists who say they’re conservatives - MOST conservatives actually also support change, i.e. they don’t want to roll back rights, they are just more resistant to change than the more progressively minded liberal wings of society. They fear change more, and the unrest it could bring.  and that love of stability and fear of unrest is shared by liberals too, especially liberals who have an invested stake in the economy.   so unfortunately - other than that there are fascists we have to excise from society - it’s not all so black and white.",realblaketan,2025-05-08T07:34:55,-3

"Which is why cases such as now are so horrifying: when it is better, politically speaking, to have literally disabled representatives than it is to lose a a vote on a bill, you are given major incentive to outright puppet representatives instead of replacing them. Diane Fenstein is the poster child for that, because her staff was outright tricking her into voting sanely by the end.  The reason why it needs to be automatic and, most importantly, a-political is because recalls, Congressional acts, or otherwise ""normal procedure"" can become insurmountable hurdles during deadlocks. This is especially true if your agenda is to simply damage the government or its credibility: by deliberately blocking attempts to removing sitting members of Congress, regardless of how direly it may be needed, you can sow chaos and instability without lifting a finger.

"And Melania loves Donald.  All you’re showing me is you didn’t learn your lesson and will happily line up to let the next leopard eat your face. Some folk never learn.

Because the simplest answer is she’s telling the truth.   Also, the simplest answer is that Susan Collins is deeply disappointed in Trump so you may as well jump on her re-election bandwagon.   Seriously though, you are showing the height of naivety and that you’ve clearly never worked in the field or done more beyond very low level volunteer campaigning.   Politicians aren’t heroes. They are conmen and conwomen. Even the “good” ones are just snake oil salesmen whose product happens to cure 1 in 5 coughs. Politicians spouses are usually the same. People who want power are seldom good people. And even the candidates I have known to be good people  were corrupted by the system once they were in it.

You ought not say “well maybe the old Fetterman is still in there somewhere!” You ought to be pissed off that your public servant is failing you at a time where are any failure cannot be afforded.  You’re making excuses for a guy who is either incapable of doing his job and refuses to step aside or is just the exact type of grifting asshole we’ve come to expect from our politicians (once more, I know the guy, it’s that one).

Maybe you can make it a consultation of several physicians. Maybe you can leave the conclusion part to other politicians - because, obviously, there are non-medical implications.   Or you can argue against physician involvement altogether - but then you need to address people's concerns in some other way. Like, talking about senators, you can just say that there are many of them, so it's no big deal if one or two are having issues.
