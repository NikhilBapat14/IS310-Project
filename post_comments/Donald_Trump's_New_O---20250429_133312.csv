After Trump's election win, the leader of the conservative party, the Liberal Party, doubled down on his Trump like policies and rhetoric and his party was leading in the polls. Then Trump was actually inaugurated and he's been walking back his rhetoric and policies since then, but he still can't change the perception that he is ""Temu Trump.""

"He‚Äôs useful to them now. But I think he knows when the music stops he won‚Äôt be getting off the ride and now he‚Äôs panicking because the ride is slowing down. The Saudis and Russians def are getting their $$s worth but the thing about those people is they always want more. Eventually, if other rich people stop propping him up, his usefulness will wane and they‚Äôll come for their financial investments. The other stuff is the interest paid on top of the loan.",Derpy_Diva_,2025-04-29T18:45:23,4
"Yes exactly the Saudi‚Äôs and the Russians.  I have to be honest with Elons help is not needed for destabilization Trump and China just did that without his help.  We are 100 days in out of thousands.  We are still fighting battles but the war is over.  With that being said thought I am and will continue to be excited about 3 spheres of influence and competing ideas Europe, America,and APAC.  Conditions in the us are terrible and it is because Europe spent too long as us being their big brother.  The world is changing and I think for the better but it is going to hurt.",Bigbeardhotpeppers,2025-04-29T15:58:25,1
Is your anger at the political system seasonal? ;),axonxorz,2025-04-29T18:17:06,3
"I think the fracturing of the military would make this not possible. While the political demographics of the military are certainly favoring conservatives, rounding up groups of civilians that have done nothing wrong isn't going to fly with the officers and the soldiers. There will be mutinies if this kind of radical doctrine were implemented.     The civil war would happen before this happens in my opinion, you can't indoctrinate a million adults who come from many different walks of life in a 2 year span, it's just not going to work.",spacedude2000,2025-04-29T15:44:12,7
"The more people stand up, the less likely there are any repercussions for any of the people doing so   Safety in numbers. If you believe in the Constitution, if you believe in equal rights, if you believe in the possibility of a better world, you absolutely should in streets with your brothers and sisters.

I've always wondered what he actually stands for. Does he just kinda like to have a place to go to during the day to stay social?,plipyplop,2025-04-29T19:40:21,5

"I'm not sure how the consolidation of money and power in the US translates to anything better for the US citizens. I believe what we are seeing is a shift of money and policy away from our allies NOT because we need to let them walk on their own, it's to shift spending of the federal government and consolidate power. Why haven't we seen any of the ""savings"" of doge? Where is that money that was already allocated and now denied or pulled back? Why do we need more massive tax breaks for the millionaire and billionaires? Where is any policy that is meant to elevate the electorate beside working to ""keep us safe from the illegals"". This isn't to help us. It's to help them cement power.  For Elon to not be needed in their efforts to destabilize the US, he's sure done more than most.",palsieddolt,2025-04-29T16:05:02,2

"I literally don‚Äôt know what you are responding to.  My points I made are:   * Trump has done more damage than Elon to the United States global soft power  * Trump has done more damage to the United States financial prowess globally  * You just need to make a god bleed and we are bleeding (metaphorically don‚Äôt get mad at the turn of phrase, a la bane)  * China doesn‚Äôt need to do anything but make us bleed  * Europe has conceded power to us for too long (this is what the tariffs are based on access the the American consumer who spends the most should come at a premium)  * If china and Europe rise as three equals than European values will rub off on china and America (a boy can dream)  * Elon can steal data but if it is secret data that has value because it is secret Elon having it makes it useless (if you SSN is compromised and 1000bots open CC in your name and everyone else‚Äôs then the SSN and CC paradigm is the government;s problem not yours vs 1 CC being in your name) a la fight club  * If he stole nuke data then it is treason and he will pay for it  * Destabilize is a broad term if the military or cops start attacking citizens we have big problems (I know you can feel the temperature in the country rising)  * AI is coming and all this will look like a walk in the park in two years it will be the biggest political issue of our time  That‚Äôs how I sleep at night.",Bigbeardhotpeppers,2025-04-29T16:31:27,1
Imo you can't compare Russia and China to the US. People in those nations were never really brought down from luxury into the regime they are in now. We are way too used to comfort to roll over to authoritarianism if our livelihoods are threatened. The only reason not much has happened -yet- is because people's lives haven't been affected on a large scale. But it is coming.,jeha4421,2025-04-29T19:05:46,2

"It happens all over the place. I just pointed out South Korea. It‚Äôs not like SK is some bastian of Democracy. If they can do it, we can do it. Dooming doesn‚Äôt help.
