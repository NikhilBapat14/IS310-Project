"Bits from article:    Close allies of President Trump are asking a judge to give the White House control over much of the federal court system.    In a little-noticed lawsuit filed last week, the America First Legal Foundation sued Chief Justice John Roberts and the head of the Administrative Office of U.S. Courts.    The case ostensibly proceeds as a FOIA lawsuit, with the Trump-aligned group seeking access to judiciary records. But, in doing so, it asks the courts to cede massive power to the White House: the bodies that make court policy and manage the judiciary’s day-to-day operations should be considered independent agencies of the executive branch, the suit argues, giving the President, under the conservative legal movement’s theories, the power to appoint and dismiss people in key roles.    Multiple legal scholars and attorneys TPM spoke with reacted to the suit with a mixture of dismay, disdain and laughter. Though the core legal claim is invalid, they said, the suit seems to be a part of the fight that the administration launched and has continued to escalate against the courts over the past several months: ignoring a Supreme Court order to facilitate the return of a wrongly removed Salvadoran man, providing minimal notice to people subject to the Alien Enemies Act, flaunting an aggressive criminal case against a state court judge.    Blake Emerson, a professor at UCLA Law, called the suit’s claims “outlandish,” and said that if it somehow succeeded, it would grant the White House control over “the means by which the judicial branch functionally operates.”    O’Connell, the Stanford Law Professor, described it to TPM as more of an attempt to tell a story about “how much power they think the executive should have” than a serious legal claim.    “There is no chance that this will prevail,” she said.",Anoth3rDude,2025-05-02T22:54:52,2

Cantor Fitzgerald supported the heritage foundation specifically Russ Vought (head of the office of budget management) when he wrote project 2025. All these actions that Trump is taking is part of a plan called scapegoat mechanism. Basically the idea is have a person in charge makes such horrible decisions that the people get so angry for change that you oblige and replace that leader. This making the masses think those problems are gone.  JD Vance is who they want to replace Trump. Vance’s benefactor, donor and mentor for over 10 years believes women should never have gotten that right is Peter Thiel. Peter Thiel personally escorted Vance into Mar-a-lago to smooth tensions between Vance and Trump. Gave Vance $15 million to become senator.  Palantir is what found Elon his adult and kids DOGE team and anyone that says Elon and Peter don’t like each other are fooling themselves, they worked together on PayPal and disagreed when one was promoted over the other. X is partnered with visa to make it a financial platform. Elon has said as part of the doge team using AI to rewrite all the social security code he wants to include in it the ability to make x the way folks can receive their benefits. Basically routed through x to get to their bank accounts. Rewriting the SSA code should take years to fully test it and make sure it’s secure for the long term instead he wants it done by September. He wants X to be an app to handle everything government related. The New York Times has an insane article out but it totally makes sense. DOGE teams have received clearance under an interagency agreement and arrived at the National Credit Union Administration and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the FCC.  Edit: gift article very nicely given by u/ Advanced_Level  https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/us/politics/trump-musk-data-access.html?unlocked_article_code=1.CU8.h6d7.ZwcbvFMgtpjZ&smid=url-share  Palantir which is led by real life German nazi (born in west Germany and raised in Swakopmund an insanely Nazi celebrating town in the 70’s where Peter Thiel’s father worked as an engineer on an uranium mine in violation of international law). Understand that the decision to fire the NSA chief and his deputy may be in fact be the most dangerous decision Trump has made so far along with the signing of the April 9th executive order removing all environmental protections and regulations through a sunset order which by all accounts even if scotus has to review it will not be stopped.  Anyone that’s says Peter Thiel doesn’t control Palantir is uninformed. Thiel directly owns roughly 180 million publicly traded shares which is 7%. His investment firm Rivendell 7 owns 34 million publicly traded shares. Other Thiel vehicles own 37 million shares. Thiel entities also own 32.5 million supervoting Class B shares in Palantir. Those class b shares carry 10 votes while public ones carry only 1 vote per share. Now here is the kicker for why he still controls Palantir (link below), Thiel has sole investment power over 335,000 class F shares as part of a trust that has 49.99% voting interest in the company.  https://www.barrons.com/articles/palantir-stock-chairman-peter-thiel-b63415c7  Timothy Haugh (recently fired NSA chief) like his last 2 predecessors were restricting the access and control Peter Thiel had through his company Palantir over the CIA/NSA to commit domestic surveillance. Palantir is the 2nd biggest defense contractor for the CIA/NSA along with providing day-to-day operations for both agencies along with UK intelligence agencies and their NHS, which is why NHS England was announced to be shutting down. The goal for Palantir is and always has been domestic surveillance and they already have it happening all across the UK with their police forces. Palantir is an intelligence corporation which provides advanced analysis, sigint, osint, criminal and threat awareness and kill chain efficiencies to all levels of US, UK, and corporate agencies.  https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-doge-recruiting-palantir/  https://www.salon.com/2024/07/22/jd-vance-owes-almost-everything-to-peter-thiel-a-pro-billionaire-and-new-right-ideologue/  https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/08/jd-vance-women-weird-voting-peter-thiel.html",nycdiveshack,2025-05-02T14:21:15,61

Furthermore, despite our collective dislike for them, we have to realize they worked hard to get into these positions as Justices, this is pinnacle of law positions in the US. A moonshot dream for most in the legal profession. They're not going to just lay down and cede power unilaterally and make themselves, their careers, and influence moot, even if Trump somehow offered to pay them off (which they know better, Trump doesn't pay up).   This seems like a very foolish and lose-lose play from the Trump administration as this could easily further sour the SCOTUS and all judges on the Federal bench against him in a much more cohesive, united front. Miller knows the only way to secure their dictatorship is to ""own"" the judiciary lock, stock, and barrel. Unfortunately for them and lucky for us, the overwhelming majority of the Judiciary is not down with that and will dig their heels in even further. Furthermore, even if they ""clean house"" in the Judiciary and replace all judges with Trump loyalists and sycophants, the clown show that will become our justice system will end up pushing Americans over the edge and the thin veil of our two-tiered justice system will drop and go full mask off. It will be clear that the law is meaningless to the power class and brutally, asymmetrically, and illegally enforced to the working class. Judicial violence from the state has never, ever gone over well or lasted very long in any society, and any country where the law protects but does not bind the power class, but which binds but does not protect the working class have almost always seen violent revolt. Roberts, Alito, and Thomas are not dumb people and fairly read up on history, they realize this and don't want to be at the sharp end of pitchforks that will inevitably come for the power class once this administration collapses.",Cuntmasterflex9000,2025-05-02T15:09:39,7

"Yes and no.  Laws were supposed to be enforced locally if at all possible.  The thing most people today don't realize is that most of the Founders would take one look at the size of our law enforcement agencies and say ""What the hell are you people doing allowing a standing army that big?""  Then they'd look at the *actual* military and faint dead away.  The idea (most of (see below)) the Founders had that standing armies were the go-to tools of tyrants comes from the fact that for all colonial powers, their army was also their colonial police arm.  The army garrison weren't *locals* and the rank and file were recruited (or conscripted) from the lowest classes (including as punishment for certain kinds of crime), so a soldier generally had no qualms enforcing unpopular laws and had no idea, nor did they usually care, why those laws may have been unpopular.  Law enforcement in the pre-civil war US, outside of slave patrols, was often just the county sheriff and whoever he deputized to assist him... and if he didn't think he could do it he'd call up the militia.  The major engagements the ATF, FBI, etc. have had over their existence would, in the pre-Posse Comitatus Act era, have been treated akin to the Whiskey Rebellion or the post-Civil-War reconstruction era government's actions against the first KKK--the government would have called up (a detachment of) the militia or army to deal with them.  *Washington was one of the exceptions to that fear of standing armies, because he absolutely loathed militias due to the poor morale and performance of militiamen during the Revolutionary War--they'd often do only the absolute minimum of their duties they could get away with and would disappear as soon as their term of service was up, regardless of what that meant for the army as a whole.",Delicious_Randomly,2025-05-02T14:03:02,8
