"There is actually logic to this move.   ""We don't have enough judges, we can't to afford to wait 200 years to go through all these cases, let's skip due process and ship them to el Salvador.

"There are a bunch of immigration judges that work in the executive branch. The activist judges he usually complains about are in the judicial branch. Which, so far, aside from complaints (and directing death threats towards them) and saying that people should be removed he has not attempted to muck with.",CockBrother,2025-04-22T14:50:25,2

"I would guess that more likely he is firing the more liberal immigration judges that are more likely to grant asylum or relief for an immigrant to stay in the US.  The AG then is able to appoint new immigration judges, which will be ones that are very anti-immigration and will expedite hearings and deny asylum and rule in favor of deportation instead.  There are stories of immigration cases in which minors (as young as like 5-12) have to represent themselves in court and are not afforded attorneys or translators.  So those cases can often be open and shut and end quickly as there is no one representing the defendant, and the defendant doesn't really even know what is going on.  Other judges would not allow for that type of thing to happen because they understand that it is ethically and morally wrong.  Yet, I guarantee that Trump will try to appoint more judges that prefer this style over ensuring that a person gets a fair hearing.",WhatRUHourly,2025-04-22T14:46:05,6
