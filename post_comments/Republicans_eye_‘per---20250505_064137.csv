"Soooooo.... ""Death Panels"" then. Got it.  It's so weird how all the fucking fascists were so scared and snowflakey about fascism when it's what they wanted all along.  Ooooh! Wait a minute.....  It's because _they_ wanted to be the ones to do it, isn't it?",FredUpWithIt,2025-05-05T06:58:14,73
"Ugh, this again? Per capita caps are just a way to cut funding and hurt the people who need Medicaid the most. It's all about saving money, not actually helping anyone.",SunKissedLadie,2025-05-05T06:43:40,27

Let‚Äôs not call them budget hawks. If they really were budget hawks they would be against tax cuts that endanger the economy.,im_in_stitches,2025-05-05T07:21:08,13

"Yes, but in the most republican way possible. That is to cut funding but make it look like someone else is cutting funding so they they can dodge responsibility.

"I like to describe myself as fiscally conservative: we need to make sure our fiscal spending comes with fiscal responsibility. What we spend money on should provide value, and the spending should have strong guardrails against fraud and abuse.   Republicans may say the same thing, but they dismantle consumer watchdogs, fire inspectors general, allow organizations to exist without a quorum of leadership, deny FOIA requests, and bypass bidding processes to self deal contracts. They use language to gaslight and project a reality that does not exist.  The truth is they are bad at math, bad at business, and bad at budgeting. I‚Äôve heard a Trump voter claim everything happening now is justified because the national debt is such an emergency. This ignores the fact that the 2017 tax cuts predicted an increase in the deficit and that played out. It ignores the fact that the debt increases over Trump‚Äôs four year term outweighed the debt increase in Obama‚Äôs eight years. It ignores the fact that Trump spent $151m in four years golfing at his own resorts when Obama spent $91m over eight years at resorts without self dealing compensation. None of these facts suggest that Trump or Republicans are good for the national debt.",MultiGeometry,2025-05-05T08:34:48,7
"Well, it depends on their political affiliation, of course. If you really need that open heart surgery, surely putting a sham shrine to Dear Leader in your living room is a small inconvenience to unlock the full range of treatment options.",rotates-potatoes,2025-05-05T07:05:43,3
