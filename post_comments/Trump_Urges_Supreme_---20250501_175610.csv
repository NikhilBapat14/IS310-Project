Judge wants to see harm caused by the program? This is beyond ridiculous. A single $1 in welfare from the government should already be deemed harm.   Venezuela is not at war. Let these 350k people apply to be US citizens from Venezuela. Then they can come back. We have an immigration system for a reason. ,Reuters-no-bias-lol,2025-05-02T04:30:00,10
