Literally a plethora of state Republicans are against the very idea of legal recreational weed (an they do this because they are seeing by their voters as being ""tough"" on drugs) but if it does pass it will be signed into law by Gov. Shapiro.",randomnighmare,2025-05-06T09:46:26,5

"Did they open it up to a public vote in Missouri? That's what I feel like I see - public wants it or doesn't care, but politicians won't do it. I wish we had more ballot measures in PA....",natelloyd,2025-05-06T10:08:16,2
