He’s holding pep rallies.  He’s just going to hear support for him.  Such an echo chamber.,REpassword,2025-04-30T13:37:07,3
"*From Bloomberg News reporter Catherine Lucey:*  President Donald Trump is finally getting on the road to promote his agenda, after spending much of his first 100 days in office ensconced in the White House or his private clubs.  Trump on Tuesday is traveling to suburban Detroit to make a speech touting his second-term record. In May, he’ll deliver two commencement addresses and travel to the Middle East.  The sudden burst of travel comes as poll numbers show voters cooling on his economic plans, on top of foreign leaders’ and investors’ worries they could trigger a [downturn](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-04-25/economists-say-trade-war-makes-us-recession-almost-a-coin-flip). Under mounting pressure to secure his first legislative win, Trump is also marshaling support for his tax bill.  Until now, Trump had fallen into a familiar pattern: weekdays at the White House and weekends in [Palm Beach](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-04-06/palm-beach-buzzes-after-trump-s-tariffs-spark-stock-selloff), where he golfs and dines at his Mar-a-Lago estate with acolytes and aides. That approach came under scrutiny as his sweeping tariffs triggered a stock market [panic](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-27/stock-market-s-p-500-enters-correction-in-trump-s-first-100-days) and spiked Americans’ economic anxiety.  People in Trump’s orbit say it is an opportune time to get the president back on the road to fire up his supporters and tout his policy proposals.",bloomberg,2025-04-30T10:22:32,4
