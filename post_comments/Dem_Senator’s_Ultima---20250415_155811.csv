"Is the guy a MS-13 member or not? If he is, he can stay there. I donâ€™t care. If not, we canâ€™t be sending random people to the El Salvador gulag run by an apparently benevolent dictator.

The problem is the penalty for illegal immigration alone is to be sent home. The penalty for MS13 membership can and should be the El Salvador gulag. We kind of need to be the good guys and not sentence random people to foreign gulag detention if they donâ€™t deserve it.,esqadinfinitum,2025-04-15T16:52:13,75
"The prison is pretty bad.  Thereâ€™s no due process either because the president was given emergency powers to do away with legal protections and procedures.  We can do that due process here when deciding if someone is MS13 to be handed over to Cecot or just flown out to El Salvador and kicked out of the plane.  As with prisoners of war, when we get our hands on them we have to be the good guys.",esqadinfinitum,2025-04-15T19:13:16,11
"They have evidence and repeated they have evidence he has ties to MS 13 and he isnâ€™t just a victim. El Salvador also has evidence. They are not just making things up. The public thinks if they donâ€™t know about it, it isnâ€™t true.",Dazzling_Pink9751,2025-04-15T17:14:39,21

"There's more than one. Which one is he in? And can you explain to me how a dictator is *given* emergency power?   So basically, you're in favor of what's been happening for years, people here illegally, most likely using stolen identities, put on a long waiting list to determine their status while they can go free and evade police when it's time for court.

Constitutional due process protections apply to everyone that comes into contact with US law enforcement and the US court system.  It's kind of a big deal to ignore that.,esqadinfinitum,2025-04-15T20:48:16,10
"Thatâ€™s a ridiculous reading of whatâ€™s going on here. Calling for due process, which is constitutionally required is not being in favor of illegal immigration. You sound like an ignorant fool.",esqadinfinitum,2025-04-16T10:56:09,2
"Touched a nerve, did I? I didn't say you favor illegal immigration. But you do seem to be in favor of overlooking the initial law-breaking act of entering illegally and then letting these individuals marinate in the system for years.  But you haven't addressed my questions. Which prison is he in? They aren't all the gulags you make them out be (and even the worst aren't much different from what we have here) as they're teaching prisoners marketable skills such as plumbing, electrical, carpentry, etc. and if he was *given* emergency power to change the country's course of being the Murder Capital of the World, how is he a dictator?
