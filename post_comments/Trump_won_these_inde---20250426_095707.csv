It's not like he spelled out a concrete plan for tariffs during election season. He mentioned tariffs a lot, but was vague the whole time. Yet she somehow believed he had a great plan, and now she's shocked that he doesn't know what he's doing.

"Except that he over-promised and under-delivered in his first term, having the worst term in around a century and proving he was not only incredibly incompetent, but also the biggest liar most people have ever encountered in their entire lives. A man so full of shit at any given moment that people could hardly wrap their brains around a president that was not just an idiot, but also a pathological liar. So everyone already knew he was absolutely NOT fit to be president again, but awful people voted for him a second (or third more likely) time and now here we are. Not only did we already have four years of first hand experience that he was a moron, not just unfit to lead, but apparently didn't even want to lead, he simply wanted the prestige and power. And of course in the interim he wouldn't even shut up or go away, and made all of these plans very well known prior to making it back into the White House, so there are no excuse for these voters anyway. These ""I didn't know"" or ""I was lied to"" people can kindly stfu and stay out of politics in the future since they are apparently too stupid to make an informed decision.
