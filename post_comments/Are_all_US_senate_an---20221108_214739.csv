"Senators, Governors, and some judges are elected en masse by the entire population of the state, most often by a first-past-the-post majority, though at least one state (I suspect a handful of others but don't know of the top of my head) has ranked choice voting for some state positions.  Members of the House of Representatives are only elected by residents in their districts, rather than the state at large.",Ent3rpris3,2022-11-09T00:51:55,22
"I'm not sure what you mean by ""according to county."" If you're asking if there's some sort of electoral college-like function at the state level, then the answer is no. In every race, whoever has the most votes from voters wins at the end of the day. It's that simple. There is some local variation in HOW we count the votes, though.  In most races, we use FPTP, or First Past the Post. This just means whoever has the most votes at the end wins. This is a nice system in that if you've got a hard two party system, it's very simple, easy to understand, and tends to produce majority winners. The downside is that it very much reinforces the two party system which a lot of people don't like (fairly). So a statewide race, like Senator, would count all the votes in the state. A House race is a regional race, though, so it would only count the votes in that district, which is why you can see someone like Lauren Boebert get elected out of a bluer state like Colorado. The place where her district is happens to be a very republican part of CO.  There's been some recent reforms to use ranked voting, and especially to combine it with primary reform, however. For example, in AK, the top four candidates advance to the general regardless of party--which is why there are two Reps running in the race, Begich and Palin (yes that Palin). Also, AK uses a ranked system where voters order the candidates in terms of preference, and if no one gets a majority in the first count, then the worst performer is eliminated and his votes are redistributed to the next preferred candidate until a majority winner is found. But in this case, there is still a winner determined by popular vote ultimately.",mormagils,2022-11-09T08:31:41,9

"Alaska and Maine have ranked choice at the state level (governor, US Senator).",Cleomenes_of_Sparta,2022-11-09T03:11:12,15
There are a few states that use a top-two runoff.  Georgia is going to have one for their US Senator.,NerdyLumberjack04,2022-11-09T09:23:35,6
">I'm not sure what you mean by ""according to county."" If you're asking if there's some sort of electoral college-like function at the state level, then the answer is no.   They *used* to, though.  Georgia's Democrat primary used a [county unit system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_unit_system) from 1917 to 1962, when SCOTUS ruled it unconstitutional.",NerdyLumberjack04,2022-11-09T09:26:56,2
"I mean, really we shouldn't be using the South's election mechanics for ANY sort of precedent unless it's during Reconstruction or after 1965. It's no secret that the South had unfair and unfree elections for a very long time to preserve white power and disenfranchise African American voters.",mormagils,2022-11-09T09:37:40,3
