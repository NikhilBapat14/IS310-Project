Donald Trump's signature move is to suffer crushing defeat while claiming absolute victory.,Just_the_nicest_guy,2025-04-29T09:37:50,1306
History is filled with crazy kings and emperors.     But to have one in the contemporary world with so much media to record everything is fascinating.     From his comments Trump is obviously aware that he's responsible for the downfall of the Conservatives.  Not only that but he's aware that this is because so many Canadians dislike him. And yet he still somehow seems happy about this.     It's really scary that someone whose brain is that broken has his finger on the nuclear button.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-29T10:04:49,428
"Everybody is saying that Poilievre and the Conservatives lost because of Donald Trump and his ""Canada is the 51st state"" comments.

There is no vision, goal, or achievement they aim for: they only want the power to lash out at whomever or whatever they blame for their own misery. The tariffs, CECOT, Guantanamo, dismantling human services, and now giving military arms to cops–*none of it* is to accomplish anything that's arguably better for America or the world.

"I think Doug Ford went down and saw firsthand that the US Administration isn’t some rapid trade protectionist state trying to make deals to improve their position by bullying.   He was probably told by Trudeau and Carney that there was no plan at the White House, it was complete chaos. He didn’t believe them, went down to negotiate as a “fellow strong man” and when he got an audience, he was just met with uncontrolled stupidity and chaos.  So he came back to Canada and was like “well you guys were right, those guys have ZERO plan” and started to work with the liberals to mitigate damage.   The reason he was silent is because he’s largely been working behind the scenes. It’s why he was so against Pollievre and Smith being willing to buddy buddy with Trump. Ford (correctly) identified that there is ZERO to gain trying to be on Trumps good side. Trumps understanding of the economy is at a kindergarten level, and he’s completely surrounded by Yes Men. He also is very clearly either dementia’d or senile.  Remember, it wasn’t too long after Ford came back that Trump and Lutnick started tariffs on unpopulated rocks full of penguins and shit like that.  All you can do after you meet with that crazy is go “we are fucked” and just go play defense for the next 3.5 years. Trumps going to drag us all down into a recession if we like it or not.  Being on his “side” won’t stave that off either. It just means you get front row seats to the shit show.",Karsh14,2025-04-29T11:29:33,26
