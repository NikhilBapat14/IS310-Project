She could have been our president instead of the bumbling moron sitting in the White House right now.  Genuinely breaks my heart to think of what could have been.,Fun-Memory-6729,2025-04-02T23:50:19,10
Quick question from a Democrat: Did anyone hear Harris supporting Crawford before the election? It is very easy to say I'm glad after a favorable result. We need Senators and people in Congress pushing hard when things are difficult as they have been for the last 2 months. Talking after a result is too easy. Only a few democrats has been talking against Trump's terrible meassures before Wisconsin. Those are the ones We should remember and support the most.,Interesting-Ask9935,2025-04-03T11:08:04,4

I voted for Harris but I‚Äôd honestly be okay if she just disappeared from the limelight and didn‚Äôt go anywhere near 2028.,DinkandDrunk,2025-04-03T12:13:13,-6
Kamala is not perfect but I think she is a class act. It takes a lot of personal strength to speak to Wisconsin and be encouraging like this knowing that the blue wall had just crumbled for her.,valt10,2025-04-03T09:28:36,41
"Nah, we did our part. The stupid and shitty people let her down.",Ok-Ice2942,2025-04-03T07:40:31,68
"That's what I used to think. I wrote as much on another thread. Another redditor replied to my comment and posited that Biden should have given up his presidency to Harris much earlier - like, years earlier - than he did. That way, Harris, as president, could have ensured that Don the Con got the legal justice that was coming to him to utterly disqualify him as a candidate in 2024.   I still can't stop wondering how much better we could be had this scenario played out.",Kimmm711b,2025-04-03T11:06:37,19

Good thing there's a primary process and she can go through that with other candidates and you can make your choice then if you're actually a Dem.,blueindsm,2025-04-03T13:09:20,4
"Hell yeah! Texan here, was so disappointed we couldn‚Äôt flip it.",Parking_Plankton_610,2025-04-03T06:54:20,8
"Technically speaking, I‚Äôve voted for Harris twice if you count Biden/Harris 2020. Folks can downvote if they want, but I don‚Äôt think we need to rehash any candidates at this point and I think the shine has come off Harris, Newsome, etc. Im still good with Mayor Pete but that‚Äôs a personal bias I can‚Äôt seem to shake.   We need a bunch of fresh faces to rise up in the next 2 years to champion working class causes.  Faces that don‚Äôt come with any baggage.",DinkandDrunk,2025-04-03T13:36:34,5
"I'm a Texan as well. I feel yea, It's never too late to flip Texas. It's a shame we didn't give Ted Cruz the boot.",OhioRanger_1803,2025-04-03T07:18:48,7
"What is ""baggage"" in your mind?",blueindsm,2025-04-03T14:02:04,1
"In the case of Harris, being tied to Joe Biden so closely probably could be defined as baggage for many voters. I don‚Äôt agree with that personally but I‚Äôm just being realistic about it. For Newsome, being governor of a state that anyone right of center loathes doesn‚Äôt help. Also anyone too far left hates him for being too moderate. Oh, and everyone too far left also hates Harris for not being strong enough on the Middle East.   It‚Äôs all baggage. Need new faces.",DinkandDrunk,2025-04-03T14:22:29,2
"After not too long, folks will long for the Biden years, there won't be any baggage because she was tied to Biden.",blueindsm,2025-04-03T14:31:04,4
