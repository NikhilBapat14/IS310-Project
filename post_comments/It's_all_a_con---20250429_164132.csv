"The worst part of all of this is that Trump has done literally NOTHING good for America since the day he took office, not a thing. He doesn't even have ""at least the trains run on time"" moments. Trump has been blatantly violating the Constitution and royally screwing America every single day from day one but he hasn't bothered to make a single EO that actually benefits the country to distract us from the crap he's doing.",immortalfrieza2,2025-04-30T01:58:15,6
not to mention all the job projects canceled due to the uncertainty he caused.,smoke1966,2025-04-29T20:17:10,6

"Pretty sure one of the days in the last month had the largest stock market crashes since the great depression. Tanking the market isnt hyperbole. And once we see the effects of the tariffs, stocks may continue going down.",MaximusDM22,2025-04-29T21:38:04,9

More like idiotic confidence   Or More likely idiotic confident lies,Commercial_Soft9510,2025-04-30T22:09:27,3
Tariffs were used during the depression by Republicans to fix things. It made the economy worse and was a direct extra cause of the crash,South_Victory_1187,2025-04-30T07:10:40,1
