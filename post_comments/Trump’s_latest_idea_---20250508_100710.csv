"**From Ryan Teague Beckwith, newsletter editor:**  In each case, Trump is trying to get something he wants: a smaller federal workforce, Greenland, a higher birthrate, fewer immigrants. But to get that, someone else has to give up something of value: their job, their sovereignty, their sleep, their home. And the alternatives for Trump to achieve those goals are less attractive, ranging from mass firings to mass deportations to war.  I’ve long thought that more government programs should involve direct cash payments, which cut overhead costs while giving recipients the freedom to decide how best to use the money. And such ideas aren’t exactly new: Democratic Sen. Cory Booker has long called for giving each newborn “baby bonds” that could be cashed in later in life, while then-candidate Kamala Harris pitched a $6,000 tax credit for parents of newborns during her 2024 run.  But those payments were framed as a way to help people who were already doing something, not to provide an incentive for them to do a thing in the first place.

"Trump only surrounds himself with people that can be bought, and if they can't he sends his goons to bully and intimidate them",picklehippy,2025-05-08T10:28:57,4
Well he can afford it since he’s overtly taking bribes and it seems to be working since the Legislature and Judiciary are unwilling to stop it.  I just hope that if or when MAGA loses power that the opposition goes scorched earth on Trump and his minions. They are violating laws that have statute of limitations with enough time to prosecute. Even if they can’t go after Trump himself they can go after his cabinet and everyone who works for him. If given the opportunity they need to do what should have happened in 2021. Stop playing nice. Make it crystal clear if you participate in this you will be prosecuted.  I will say I’ve always been surprised how many people are willing to risk it all for Trump. It’s nuts to me that high level operatives for him have chosen to go to jail all to please one man. Maybe if they send everyone to jail this will stop?,hmr0987,2025-05-08T10:20:03,3
"He's planning to ""cut taxes by Independence day."" I'm worried that some swing voters are going to fall for it despite our economy being in the shitter. ""The empty shelves are Biden's doing, I'm the one who made sure you don't pay taxes on overtime.""   We need a social media marketing campaign to combat this. ""Trump may have cut you a tax break, but this is how much more you pay because of his trade wars."" Democrats need to start putting money towards ads because Republicans   haven't stopped blasting their propaganda on social media.",zeaor,2025-05-08T10:43:37,3

"Simply paying people to do stuff is low-effort and intellectually lazy.  It's farming all the work out to the person receiving the money, and the results will vary *wildly*.  We want certain outcomes, and we need to put in the work to make those outcomes happen.  That's 18 years of work to raise one child to adulthood, not the 5 seconds it takes to print a check.  Lazy governments doing minimal work lead to poor outcomes.  MAGA conservatives are *lazy as hell* and it's why they are not effective.  They act like they are doing the work but they don't, and lie about the outcomes to cover it up.  We all knew kids in school like this.",UnknownAverage,2025-05-08T11:21:11,8
"Unfortunately, because the press and influencers have normalized Trump, many voters think the Republican Party is still a legitimate political entity. Everything done to hold Republicans accountable, particularly Trump, gets broadcast to the public through a lens of political persecution. I think this is why Biden and Dems were so timid to make bold moves in 2021-2024: if they move first, they play into the conservative persecution narrative. They were hoping voters would hold Republicans accountable at the ballot box. Whoops.  I’m interested in seeing how the German declaration of AfD as an illegal extremist group plays out. If enough voters are sympathetic with AfD, it’ll fizzle. But I think Germany leaders were smart to wait for this moment: the idiocy and cruelty of Trump’s first 100 days have galvanized pro-democracy factions around the world, and depressed turnout for far-right groups.",undersaur,2025-05-08T11:25:36,2
You’re not wrong. The aspect they seriously need to fix is the messaging/marketing.  There are so few democrats who are effective at combating the tidal waves of bullshit in the media. How are people going to see the issues when the narrative is owned by the group causing the problems?,hmr0987,2025-05-08T11:32:27,2
