"They're preparing for what's coming this summer. Once the shelves go bare, mass layoffs begin as the economy craters, people start losing their homes and ability to put food on the table, it's going to get really ugly in a way people can't comprehend. That's what the military is going to be used for - restoring order from the inevitable response to the desperation of the people. Also note the story that came out a few days ago about the administration looking into suspending habeas corpus which makes sense if you're about to implement martial law. Usually those things go hand in hand, so the picture is becoming clearer for what Republicans have in store for the country.",mkt853,2025-04-29T08:06:06,693

"Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 signed by Rutherford B. Hayes, amended in 1956, 1981, and 2021 to include all branches of the military and is not just some old law. It limits the power of the federal government in the use of federal military personnel to enforce domestic policies within the US. Essentially the military can't be used in civilian law enforcement action. Blatantly illegal under the existing law. Not that DJT or any of his cultists care enough about the law to enforce that but I do still have faith in SCOTUS with the exceptions of Thomas and Alito who are clear partisan hacks. I'm starting to believe Coney-Barrett, Gorsuch, and Party Boy all have a line they won't cross out of principle.

"A state governor *can* request help, but it is technically unconstitutional to do so. The US Constitution specifically notes that **only** the federal government handles foreign affairs. Foreign affairs like immigration. The state governor is technically performing an unconstitutional act by involving himself with immigration, should he request help over the matter. Thankfully the injured party, the federal government, seldom sues over the free help. That said, it doesn't matter since the governor too would not be addressing the main chokepoint.  That said, sanctuary jurisdictions are lower governments that abide by the Constitution and do not participate in immigration. They do not collect immigration information the feds do not require they collect (there are very few forms that do,) they do not report on any immigrants because that is not a status they officially collect info on, and they do not respect any detainers or any such informal requests for information, transfer of custody, or entrance into their property by immigration officials. The military here now being said immigration officials.  Everything about detainers, requests for information, transfer of custody, or entering the premises to make an arrest, all of that would require a judicial warrant.  Effectively speaking, the military will do **** all considering the federal judiciary, the ones who can handle the cases and issue warrants, isn't being expanded.

">... I can't talk to someone who can't see the reason why we might, as neighbouring countries, want to help the states who don't want to enable a Nazi fascist regime from steamrolling the continent.  Because taking a side in a civil war against the federal government is more or less the same thing actively declaring war on the country. Until it's clear the US has no effective federal government, about all we can do is take in refugees and secure the border. If they go to war amongst themselves, that'll buy a few months to get our shit together should the fascists win.  But honestly, I'm not too concerned about it. Unless they are prepared to level entire cities, they can't really apply the full force of the American military: yeah, a soldier definitely has a better gun, but there's plenty of armed Americans out there and bullets kill with almost no regard to what fires it. It'll be a protracted conflict, a war of attrition.",Dzugavili,2025-04-29T13:34:39,0

Yes I do think that the Ukraine war was definitely a misstep on his part. He got greedy. It‚Äôs a trade off. His desire for more power is a trade off between keeping his home base from overthrowing him.
