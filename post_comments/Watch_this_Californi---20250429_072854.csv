Wealth redistribution in disguise.,ChristopherRoberto,2025-04-29T09:18:16,39
"That California law may actually be in violation of federal law.  All of this stuff is a bizarre, twisted mess of stupid, no matter how you approach it.  Government needs to get the fuck out of healthcare completely and if they really want to do some good, make insurance illegal.  Healthcare bills will begin to reflect realistic prices if there is no piggy bank out there to raid for funds for every little thing people go to the doctor for and people will take an active approach to their healthcare if they have to scrutinize every bill for BS over charges and add ons and padding and markups, etc...",letmeinfornow,2025-04-29T07:39:31,49
"This is how it makes sense:  If you don't have insurance and have a medical bill, a sort of ""welfare"" program kicks in- whether funded by the government, another organization, or the doctor themselves -to help lower your costs.   If you have insurance, you don't qualify for the welfare program, thus your costs may be higher.",xAdakis,2025-04-29T12:35:38,6
"The funny thing is that the CS rep doesn't seem to realize that the math isn't mathing.  I'm definitely not a fan of the idea of single payer for a host of reasons, but out current system is an absolute joke.",the_house_from_up,2025-04-29T15:49:56,3

"I have the opposite experience. At least 3/4 of my medical bills say something like ""Health plan discount"" and that alone knocks 40-50% off the bill. Like the fact I have insurance and they only do pre-approved stuff (they know the money is coming) means they can discount the final bill.",OliverMonster1,2025-04-29T14:57:18,2
"Yeah making insurance illegal would be amazing.     I dealt with this same issue with my shitty dental insurance. When I needed a procedure done I have already had done before without insurance, it cost me almost 3 times as much out of pocket when I had insurance.    It's all such a scam.",MeLlamoKilo,2025-04-29T09:29:08,23
"I can easily see this helping with preventative care, but how do you approach emergency care? You can't negotiate when you're in a coma and you don't have time to negotiate when you're having a stroke. And that's where the biggest bills come from. ",JodiAbortion,2025-04-29T10:24:00,18
That's actually a take I hadn't heard before. Making insurance illegal,Lanky_Acanthaceae_34,2025-04-29T08:10:50,8
" If you call 911 do they make sure you can pay before they come get you? If you get cancer and your treatment is now $50k/month do you just die? It is a mess, where you have administrators and executives always scraping more off the top, and purposefully creating confusion, to keep people from getting care and then charging them more when they even go to get care. There needs to be SOME sort of motivation to keep yourself healthy. Give people tax breaks if they can show they're healthy, or at least working on being healthy. If I go to the gym twice/week I shouldn't be paying the same as someone who sits on their butt all day long drinking soda.",mojo276,2025-04-29T08:59:59,5
"Maybe all life, limb or eyesight care should be free. Every thing else has clearly posted prices.",maxroadrage,2025-04-29T11:18:43,10
"When you know just how corrupt the medical insurance, Medicare, and medicaid scam really is, it is the only option that makes sense.  Ban it.  Hospitals and doctors charge direct to the patient and the patient negotiates directly with them.  No more games.",letmeinfornow,2025-04-29T08:44:29,14
