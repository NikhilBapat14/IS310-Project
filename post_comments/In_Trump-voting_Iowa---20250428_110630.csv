"The Republican senator Chuck Grassley, who is 91 and hard of hearing, ventured into a melee at his town hall with security in tow, better to hear a constituent. A Trump supporter clad in black and pink, with the personality of a firecracker, came to his defence. “That man is a criminal,” she declared of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a wrongly deported immigrant.  “What was he convicted of?” someone asked. “He had tattoos on his body,” she replied triumphantly.  “Hey, smartass!” shouted a woman in her sixties, jumping to her feet. “You want to see my tattoo?”   “Lady,” the Trump supporter said. “You don’t know what a tattoo is.”  “Yes I do, I’ve got one!” the woman shouted, tapping her chest.  The Trump supporter dismissed her with a wave of one hand. “I’ve had enough of you Democrats,” she said.   “We’ve had enough of you!” someone shouted back.

"> Stupidity is a more dangerous enemy of the good than malice. One may protest against evil; it can be exposed and, if need be, prevented by use of force. Evil always carries within itself the germ of its own subversion in that it leaves behind in human beings at least a sense of unease.  > Against stupidity we are defenseless.  > Neither protests nor the use of force accomplish anything here; reasons fall on deaf ears; facts that contradict one’s prejudgment simply need not be believed – in such moments the stupid person even becomes critical – and when facts are irrefutable they are just pushed aside as inconsequential, as incidental. In all this the stupid person, in contrast to the malicious one, is utterly self satisfied and, being easily irritated, becomes dangerous by going on the attack.

"241108\_Rolf-and-Trump\_Sound-of-Music    In The Sound of Music there's a scene in the second half (the Nazi Arc). Recall that Liesel has been seeing Rolf, the messenger boy, on the sly. He's an earnest young man, if typically sexist and underemployed. But he encounters Liesel again, wearing a Nazi uniform. He tries to tell her something, but becomes tongue tied, perhaps to Liesel's fond amusement. But then he straightens himself and snaps out a salute, declaring ""Heil Hitler"".  Liesel is a little taken aback, but Rolf is able to deliver his message, which is to be relayed to Baron von Trapp. Liesel coyly asks ""Wouldn't you rather come by the house to deliver it in person?"", suggesting another rendezvous in the garden, but Rolf has found himself and is now all business. He has 'more important' things to do.  Rolf is very much Liesel's social inferior. Barely employed, uneducated, and without title; he is not going to win Liesel's hand. The cynic in me thinks of him as possibly a dalliance of Liesel's, knowing that she will likely be married off to the second son of a Count if she is lucky. And Rolf is no doubt acutely aware of this as well. He knows that he is nothing to the Baron, and will be set aside as a summertime fling soon enough.  But in the Nazi Party of the Anschluss, he has become somebody. He has a purpose and power. With his uniform, he is seen with respect and a little fear, if only because people know that a painful dark alley awaits those who insult or disrespect a Brownshirt. And now it is \*he\* who will set aside the pretty Baron's daughter!  Young American men are falling behind. They are less educated than women lately, eschewing college in greater numbers.

"Most likely they will.          In Trump's first term farmers got screwed pretty hard by his trade fight with China, so he tossed out $32 billion in farmer subsidies (or whatever the number was, it was somewhere around there). Farmers were happy enough with that that they lined up to vote him back in again, and all the congressmen from the farm belt will be happy to get a boost from giving them another handout. Covid bailout money was another boost, pretty much every self-run farm owner was able to declare as a business and collect some amount money from that, too.          But the biggest reason why is that the largest chunk of those bailouts went right into the pockets of corporate farms at the expense of the little guys. It's not the little guys from this article who are helped by the bailouts, really, it's the big operations that are lobbying congress to make it happen. A Republican controlled congress is pretty much guaranteed to throw them a bailout because it's like printing free campaign money, but also Democrats usually help carry those bills because they're a better investment than trying to get farmers support throughout a lot of red areas that won't allocate cash to them through social programs instead if they aren't bailed out.",Oodlydoodley,2025-04-28T21:36:16,2

That last bit is the truly scary part about the country now. There is no such thing as bi-partisan efforts. Compromising with dems is considered traitorous. Either the dems have to sweep the executive and congress or nothing will get done. Republicans are too good at stonewalling dems and the dems won’t color outside the lines the way republicans do.
