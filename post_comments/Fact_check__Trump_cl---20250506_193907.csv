Well we don't do much business with canada anymore.....,ZZartin,2025-05-06T19:42:18,406
"TLDR;  “We don’t do much business with Canada from our standpoint. They do a lot of business with us. We’re at like 4%,” Trump said.  That “4%” figure is wrong. Official US data shows that **Canada bought about 17% of US goods exports in February and March**, the last month for which data is available – more than any other country. Canada bought about 16% of US goods exports in January, second only to Mexico.""",Drtardis95,2025-05-06T19:40:17,138

"He just doesn’t, or refuses to, understand trade.  Each Canadian buys about $3,500 worth of American goods per year, far, far higher per person than an American citizen purchasing Canadian goods.

They are not robbing the USA blind, the opposite is true, they are our best customer.",dbuck1964,2025-05-06T19:49:34,33

"I guess tastes differ. Yes, you can get good food there, but in France i enjoy the daily staples that are super cheap. Then again, I am considering moving there so I am biased.",Complete_Question_41,2025-05-07T10:14:47,3
"Intel, Raytheon, AMD, Google are 20 minutes away.  There is a Quantum Computing research centre 20 minutes away.  Blackberry, 4G, 5G were all born here.  We make our own chips.  ETA: Facebook, Amazon, and a couple other major IoT companies have engineering offices here.  The ""like"" was born here, even.  It's amazing what people dont know about Canada and innovation.",Postom,2025-05-07T00:00:30,0

"I'm not just talking about one country. And I am talking about hypothetically if we hadn't started a trade war. I do think investing in local manufacturing is a much better strategy than pissing people off with a trade war. And I do think that if the US could produce them cheap enough, other countries, not necessarily Canada specifically, would have an interest in semiconductors produced in the US. Not because of the US name, but because of the Micron name or the TSMC name. Now, I think our produces will be avoided regardless of how good they are or how cheap, because we started an unnecessary trade war and started making threats of war to our allies.",Melody-Prisca,2025-05-07T00:11:11,1
"This area is an incubator for innovation; ever since the smartphone started.  Trillions of dollars have flowed in; including brains the likes of Stephen Hawkins -- his Perimiter Institute is here.    Chips are easy manufacturing processes.  Most FPGAs are, that I have found.; the IP that can be bought and IP mass produced.  We possess that capability.    Regarding nationality: it was the wrong fight, at the wrong time; with the wrong people; for the wrong reason.  Canada?  Talk to them; they figure out a means.  But taking a sledgehammer?  Well,.you (US) loses.  It's was immeasurably stupid.",Postom,2025-05-07T00:18:57,2
"Of course Canada possesses the capability. It's part of why I don't understand any of what our president is doing here. All he had to do was some posturing to his base, and then actually work with our allies, but no, we decided we don't want allies. We decided that even if we have a 200%+ trade surplus with a country like UAE, that we're going to put tariffs on their goods. We decided our neighbors and long term allies were better off making threats to than deals with. Despite depending on one of them, Canada, for so much. None of it makes any god damn sense.",Melody-Prisca,2025-05-07T00:26:27,1
"Actually, funny enough, Canada isn't the problem.  Never was.  I'm sure you're shocked.    By the inaccurate measure of deficit/surplus is wrong.  40m Canadians vs 340m Americans is a1: 8.5 ratio.  So for his math to work, for every Canadian, they have to buy 8.5x what an American buys, of american goods.  To even it out.    We actually run in the positive, except when America goes into crazy mode on energy -- oil, gas, electricity.  Cut those out and each Canadian is being more than 8.5 Americans are, in American goods and services.  How do you fix that?  Well, fuck, seriously?  Anyway, Americans cooling it on heat, AC and driving.  We are supplying a need.  But vilified for it.",Postom,2025-05-07T00:47:06,3
