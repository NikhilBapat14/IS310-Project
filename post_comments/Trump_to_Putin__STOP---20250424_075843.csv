"Until someone stops pussyfooting around this war will be continue to be a long drawn out conflict likely resulting in all of Ukraine being absorbed into Russia.   Either the U.S. accepts that a dictator will eventually take over an entire country. Or the U.S. supplies Ukraine sufficient to stop Russia and push them to a stalemate on reasonable (who knows what’s actually reasonable) borders.   Zelensky isn’t wrong in his assumption that any peace agreement that doesn’t involve security guarantees is just pushing Ukraine’s death out a few more years. Under Putin, and likely any Putin successor, Ukraine will always be viewed as Russia’s and a place to someday be taken back.   Land concessions now will really only work if in return Ukraine is able to arm and protect themselves sufficient to stop any future invasion. I don’t know why any leader would give up territory now on the promise that Russia won’t do it again.",EliteJassassin101,2025-04-24T11:21:39,1518

"""Kal-El Nooo!!!"" This has the same stupid energy, and I say this as a Trump believer and supporter.   Imo, only way to end this war quicker is for Trump to stop all weapons deliveries and intelligence sharing, and then fully back Russia. It'll never happen, but that sure would put an end to the war pretty quick if Trump was serious.  At this point, there is ZERO benefit to Russia to end the war now. Ukraine gets a pause and reprieve, as their numbers dwindle and their country continues to collapse, and they get the opportunity to reporting their collapsing positions, and even if they completely stop the war, in a few years, once a pro war President is back in office, which shouldn't be hard to do, we get Ukraine/Russia war 3.0 again. Russia will win, there's no question. Whether it's now, or in a couple of years, Russia wins.  Ukraine won't surrender because the ruling class of Ukrainr is getting rich of the US and other western nations who will keep funding it, and even though they know their country is getting destroyed, the ruling class is protecting their own, conscription is largely in the poor regions of Ukraine, and until they expend the life of every last undesirable Ukrainian where they finally have to amstart forced conscription against their own, then they give up. Well, how many more years can they milk this mess?  Trump just needs to cut our losses and back away and let them work it out.",GeneticsGuy,2025-04-25T03:03:03,3

And it's a plan far worse then any of those proposed by Trumps own advisors like Rubio or good foreign policy analysts.     From stating that he won't send more aid to Ukraine, to refusing NATO as a possibility the US gave up A LOT of leverage over both Russia and Ukraine (more difficult to credibly threaten Russia to increase aid if you say you won't send any at all)   To not making negotiations with EU, Ukraine and US on one side to increase total leverage instead of negotiations between only US and Russia.    To sending Wittkoff inexperienced in this type of negotiations that simply comes back with Russian propagand and zero achievments the progress on negotiations has been negative, with Russia emboldened, Ukraine untrustful of US intentions and Europe trying to understand what the endgoal of the US is (it has increased EU support for Ukraine though, i will gladly give him that point)  It's not that the process isn't extremly difficult, but it's that it's being done really badly. I can applaude Trump for trying his best, but this is the biggest western war in Europe since WW2 and Trumps foreign policy cabinet, with the partial exception of Kellog and Rubio is filled with peoples whose competence is more and more dubious or even have conflict of interests in Russia while he himself clearly doesn't have the time and energy to properly understand the situation.

"Oh yes US intelligence is not irrepleacable but extremly useful. That said it would be completly irrational for the US to stop that since the cost is essentially non existent. Same for sanctions, it would be a massive geopolitical selfharm from the US to damage EU security and trust in every alliance for little to no benefit.  Russia does not have the resources to fight for another year this way, let alone 3, obviously ukraine isn't in a great position either, but unless Europe fails on the money and weapons part or Ukraine really botches the army reforms underway Russia does not seem in a position to make serious progress.   I actually wrote a relatively long summary regarding both Russias situation a couple months ago and what the west could do to seriously aid Ukraine at the lowest price possible. The inital part is why i share the opinion of various analysts that with current conditions Russia will have to stop at the start of next year.

"Fair enough i should be more precise.   Here is the Constitutional passage who prohibits the election of the Verkovna Rada   ""In the event that the term of authority of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine expires while martial law or a state of emergency is in effect, its authority is extended until the day of the first meeting of the first session of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine , elected after the cancellation of martial law or of the state of emergency."" the Rada also designates other elections unless the timeframe is already determined by laws.

"TLDR: Having elections under martial law would go against the Ukrainian constitution and laws, it would be impossible to make any fair election during the war due to Ukraine population either risking to be targeted by Russian missiles, fighting near the frontline or outside Ukraine without an efficient voting system.   In addition Ukrainians don't want elections during wartime, neither does the parliament and not even the ones who might profit the most from it.

I fully realize that war is an absolute shitshow but i would say that from what we can see in this case it's by far the lesser evil.    If you can propose a plan that avoids Russia attacking Ukraine again, that keeps US geopolitical interests relatively intact (which tend to rely on not having wars around Taiwan or other economically crucial areas) and if possible, though this isn't a prerequisite, keeps a tiny bit of justice then go ahead, i would be genuinely happy to see a plan like this, a plan that could avoid so much suffering.

"that's actually a great question without a completly clear answer.

"Yes i trust the polls when the margin is big enough and it would be better to hear that if the elections could be done in the environment they are normally held.

Finally there aren't even enough candidates since the candidates who would normally challenge Zelensky  and could win don't want to have elections during the war. And all this would cost billions.
