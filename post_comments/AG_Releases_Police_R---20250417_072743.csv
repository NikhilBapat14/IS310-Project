"I'm still confused as to why he had to go to the most terrible prison on earth instead of just being shipped back to his home country like any other illegal alien? All his gang related crimes are alleged. There have been no convictions. The most incriminating evidence I've seen is he had ""gang related tattoos"" but until I see the tattoos on his body and how they're related to gangs, I'm not convinced. Some other police reports said he was hanging out with known gang members. Idk what the threshold is for confirming gang affiliation.",specter491,2025-04-17T09:05:20,721

This is a complete lie. Like you clearly didn‚Äôt even read the source. As it states:  > Expedited removal may happen when a noncitizen:  > * Comes to the U.S. without proper travel documents > * Uses forged travel documents > * Does not comply with their visa or other entry document requirements  And it provides [this link](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF11357) from Congress.gov on expedited removal. **Nowhere** does it mention it can‚Äôt be applied to ‚Äúlong term‚Äù illegal aliens.

"Sure, and the standard of proof that the government must meet to prove the fact that someone is here illegally is clear and convincing evidence. It's not a high burden to meet. Most people admit they aren't here legally. But the burden is on the government at this stage.  Once the government has met that standard, the accused individual can petition for relief. At that point, the petitioner has the burden of proving that they deserve relief, and the type of relief they seek determines the evidentiary standard.",trbtrbtrb,2025-04-17T13:09:55,7

Once again you do not know what you are reading. Garcia is not covered by (a). He is covered by (c) because he is illegal.

"He admitted he was here illegally in 2019. Yes. Then the burden was on him to prove that he had credible fear or whatever the stupid statute says. He proved that, so the judge blocked his deportation to El Salvador.  Once his deportation was blocked, he was de facto residing in the US legally. People with TPOs are considered temporary legal residents. That's why he was granted a work permit. His status remains legal until the government petitions for removal of the TPO. If he were involved in criminal activity, they could bring that to a judge and ask that the TPO be reversed.",trbtrbtrb,2025-04-17T13:42:07,12
That literally proves my point. Someone who has been here for 2 years preceding the immigration officers determination is ineligible for expedited removal.  Also I never said I'm not conservative. I said I'm libertarian. You can be both libertarian and conservative.,trbtrbtrb,2025-04-17T13:14:14,29

You‚Äôre clearly are unable to read because as said - it‚Äôs not **just** saying someone has been here for two years. I literally emphasized the ‚ÄúAND‚Äù for a reason. Let me repeat it:  ‚Äú**AND cannot prove that they have been physically present in the United States for the two years preceding the immigration officer‚Äôs determination that they are inadmissible for fraud or misrepresentation or lack of proper entry**‚Äù  In addition per source:  > Each alien placed in expedited removal under this designation bears the affirmative burden to show to the satisfaction of an immigration officer that the alien has been present in the United States continuously for the relevant period.  Was proof shown? CLEARLY NOT. I‚Äôll also emphasize this doesn‚Äôt even apply to ‚Äúinadmissible for fraud or misrepresentation or lack of proper entry‚Äù   You‚Äôre clearly a liberal regarding illegal aliens not being deported.

"> He was deported under the Alien Enemies Act.  Again, you‚Äôre wrong. There‚Äôs that liberal bias of yours.   Per the Act, it‚Äôs **specifically** for illegal aliens of Venezuelan citizenship who also have ties to Tren de Aragua (TdA), a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization  > Based on these findings, and by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including 50 U.S.C. 21, I proclaim that all Venezuelan citizens 14 years of age or older who are members of TdA, are within the United States, and are not actually naturalized or lawful permanent residents of the United States are liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies. I further find and declare that all such members of TdA are, by virtue of their membership in that organization, chargeable with actual hostility against the United States and are therefore ineligible for the benefits of 50 U.S.C. 22.
