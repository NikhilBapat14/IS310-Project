Do you know what it would take to seize Los Angeles or New York?  Unless he's willing to pull troops out across the globe, he's going to need A LOT more than what's stationed here.  We're fucking 2 seconds away from our former allies selling off their treasury bonds and tanking the dollar.  Then the government won't be able to borrow shit to help fund the fucking military.    I agree we are headed towards a civil war tho.  All it takes is one rouge governor to tell Trump to go fuck himself and ""challenge them/make them"".  THEN we are fucked.
