"He and the moron who hired him must be held accountable; If I hired a new teacher, and that teacher murdered a class of students we would not just let the teacher and myself, the person who hired him, go free.",animalslover4569,2025-05-01T09:18:42,1

DOGE is still running strong. All federal employees have to plug into the lan or wifi at work or they'll get disciplinary action. Workers are spending 3 hours just waiting for a parking space or desk to open  DOGE is getting worse,Threeseriesforthewin,2025-05-01T10:29:50,1

"Oh, look, more out of context Democrat bashing from you. I'm not even looking for your posts.. You're just that transparent with the propaganda. We get it, your Bernie Sanders tattoo is your identity, but let it go...
