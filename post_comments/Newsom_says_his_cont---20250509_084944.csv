these products fall outside the state's cannabis regulation/taxation,box-cable,2025-05-09T08:57:45,6
". . . highly effective at keeping his cartel policy in place. California's recreational cannabis market needs less regulation, not more.   Places like Humboldt and Mendocino counties have been ravaged by the greedy cartel-like restrictions Newsom brought in. People who used to grow before recreational legalization are shut out because the quotas are already filled and they don't want downward price pressure. In other words, they want the right to sustain black market prices on the citizens of California. That is bullshit.   California needs to back way the fuck off on the regulatory heavy-handedness. When we tried to put in a pond hoping that would give us a better chance of getting a grow permit in Humboldt, the state came back and told us just the engineering fees would be thirty grand and we should budget $200,000 for a pond! This was not a swimming pool, it's just a pond. California is absurdly overpriced because of regulatory over-reach and Newsom is not going to touch the system he helped to put in place.   Newsom needs to back off and California needs to open up it's permit process, back the fuck off on the consumption taxes and not worry about CBD derived competition because cannabinoids are nothing to be scared of. The more the merrier in this case. Newsom needs to go find a new hobby.",ahfoo,2025-05-09T09:03:28,2
"which is why it got banned as normal hemp producers wanted nothing to do with the stricter regs while hemp manufacturer's exploited a loophole (hemp regs are nothing compared to legal rec market cannabis). They don't even have required coa testing so who knows whats actually in their products. As for delta-8 the molecule itself is probably fine but how its made is extremely problematic with no third party testing, they use p-Toluenesulfonic acid refluxed for hours at high heat and then remove it with a vacuum pump but if they don't test how do they know the oil is free of the acid? As someone who worked in california cannabis (I quit this month, got a much better paying cannabis job on the east coast), the hemp loopholes and blackmarket are killing the industry currently (hemp can take federal tax dedcutions as well, cannabis can't so are effective tax rate is about 60% so every gross dollar profit 45 cents go to the fed and 15 go to the state leaving legal companies with about 40 cents for every dollar of gross profit were specifically taxed on gross because we can't deduct).",SPACE_ICE,2025-05-09T09:11:09,2
"The regs specifically themselves are not really that bad (its actually retail food and safety code mostly plus the track and trace stuff and record keeping/sops) but its specifically the permit fees for cannabis are ridiculous (plus no federal tax deductions keeping gross taxes crippiling) that would be nothing in comparison for a different business. Just to even apply for anything other than a micro is like 50k, and thats not guarenteed you even get approved. Personally having talked with a few dcc regulators the state agency itself wants a few large companies instead of small businesses because it makes their jobs easier, many at the dcc were taking a promotion to move in from other agencies, few use cannabis and most actually hate thats its even legal. IMO its a culture problem at the dcc and punitive permit fees along with fed taxes that make california unfriendly to smaller companies. Throw in landlords see ""cannabis zone"" and jack their rental rates up because they think cannabis prints money while were operating on msrgins tighter than restuarants. It's fucked, I'm leaving to work in a state on the east coast for better pay. Add in that doing legacy is basically a slap on the wrist and it makes going legal kind of a bad idea honestly, from working the rec side the profitability is almost non-existant now as these conditions created a race to the bottom effect as you go for quality and the legacy market offes the same quality for 1/2 the price forcing legal companies to aim for bottom of the barrel pricing. State really underestimated long time smokers and heady guys have no issues buying black market and will go for quality/price while the majority of dispensary customers don't care about quality they want cheap.",SPACE_ICE,2025-05-09T09:27:10,2
