"If they minded their constitutional duty, he never would have been sworn in twice:  14th Amendment:  >""Whoever incites, sets on foot, assists, or engages in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States or the laws thereof, or gives aid or comfort thereto, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.""    And Jack Smith should have expedited and declared ""emergency"" every single slow-walked hearing and distraction that Cannon tried to throw in the way of convicting Trump, so there would be no question of his culpability under the law.     https://constitution.findlaw.com/amendment14/annotation15.html#:\~:text=Section%20Three%20of%20the%20Fourteenth,rebellion%22%20against%20the%20United%20States.",XSinTrick6666,2025-05-08T10:58:07,111

"Impeachment has lost all meaning, in one hand Trump got impeached twice and never removed, he brags about it now.  In the other hand they tried to impeach Biden several times makins up BS reasons, the result is that impeachment is only just a gesture, Republican managed to defang its significance.",Cyclotrom,2025-05-08T17:08:07,2
"The legislative Republicans love this. They get to have all the perks of being a house member or senator and literally don't have to do any of the job functions. Just sit back and enjoy the spectacle that is dereliction of duty, relinquishing your power, and abdication of responsibility. Answer to voters? Pfft, the orange guy will ensure voting is an afterthought. At least, that's how all this seems to be playing out.",J-the-Kidder,2025-05-09T04:10:02,1

All of them are fucking useless liars and charlatans and even those that appear to be on America's side can't be trusted. They are all compromised with dark money, or CIA Epstein kid diddling levels of blackmail.      We need a reset, term limits, and working class people filling these roles.

No more ""retiring"" from a 150K a year ""public service"" job with a net worth that could buy you several small islands.  It's OVER!",Nonfictional_Strange,2025-05-08T21:48:52,-2
"70 million voted for him but he must be removed because 500k said so? That‚Äôs not how any of this works. lol And please, please , please Dems, do not go down this pointless rabbit hole again. It‚Äôll just ensure we have another 8 years of Republican presidents. I know my thought on this seems very unpopular but maybe the Dems should be creating and articulating an alternative platform and bolstering some young, energetic candidates to help take that to the masses. Crazy him? I mean why do anything but the absolute bare minimum of saying Trump Bad. Me no like Trump. Then they could lose again and Gino the talk show circuits expressing their dismay over how Americans could possibly not like them. I really fear the lesson from the last election was not only not understood, but that it is being seen as a validation of the Biden admin and that more of the same is exactly what we need. And for the love of god, get the Crypt Keeper off TV. Every time Biden opens his mouth, more people flee the Democratic party for literally any place else.",Possible-Mango-7603,2025-05-08T18:24:19,-3
"Just remember that Congress can enforce that with just a single piece of legislation and then it's on the affected to prove, in court, that their actions were not aiding or committing an insurrection.  Which makes it all the more worrying how Republicans have tried to frame *any* pushback against the government as an ""insurrection"". It's ripe for abuse. All it would take is for the GOP to pass legislation labeling anyone going against Trump as an ""insurrectionist"" and then have GOP states ignore the courts and keep those people off the ballots.",SwimmingThroughHoney,2025-05-08T15:28:02,14
