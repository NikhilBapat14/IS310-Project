I TRUST the CDC and the FDA (and federal workers).  I DO NOT trust the installed infiltrator leadership.  There's a very BIG difference.,Financial-Special766,2025-05-07T09:15:46,10
"""for many poll respondents, every question can be a party loyalty test these days regardless of what the question may actually be about""",Jojuj,2025-05-07T08:51:42,6
"I work in biomedical research. The FDA has had a corruption problem for the last 12-15 years with a revolving door between pharm execs and FDA execs. Last few years they have been approving drugs that the CT data clearly shows are not working. It's been particuary bad the last 5 years. So sorry, I would not trust the FDA because there is simply too much money involved.",RabidGuineaPig007,2025-05-07T12:41:17,5
"I guess the question is that now that many of those former staff members at the two agencies are gone, can we trust new information that comes out of these agencies. The administration has tainted my trust in government information.",menagerath,2025-05-07T10:08:54,1
This is the problem with identity politics. There's no overarching ideology to serve as a guiding star.,InsuranceToTheRescue,2025-05-07T09:01:04,0
Is there any way for laymen to find out which drugs these are?,palenerd,2025-05-07T14:59:26,1
I don’t trust anything they say. Won’t be trying any new drugs for a few years.,peanutbutterperfume,2025-05-07T15:04:27,1
"Compair with other agencies from other countries    I routinely read both health Canada's and the fda's stance on a drug .. if they don't concur, I'll look to the UK",Tricky_Damage5981,2025-05-07T17:37:56,2
