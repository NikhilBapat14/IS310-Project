"Article snippet:  > Jennifer Vasquez Sura spoke with The Washington Post’s María Luisa Paúl after her husband’s ongoing case and the depiction by the Trump administration. Sura said her address was shared publicly when the Department of Homeland Security posted an order of protection she sought — and ultimately abandoned — against her husband. >  > The order did not have her address redacted. >  > Fearing for her own safety and the safety of her three children, she has moved to a safehouse as government officials openly mock her husband and paint him as a criminal. >  > “I don’t feel safe when the government posts my address, the house where my family lives, for everyone to see, especially when this case has gone viral and people have all sorts of opinions,” Sura said. “So, this is definitely a bit terrifying. I’m scared for my kids.”",progress18,2025-04-24T06:44:28,19
