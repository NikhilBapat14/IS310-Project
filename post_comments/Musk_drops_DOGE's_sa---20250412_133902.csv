"# Musk drops DOGE's savings goal by 92.5% for the year. Now only projects to save 7.5% of original estimates.     (Sorry trillion and billions are such big numbers hard to grasp them, hoping this helps some folks)",Danaldor,2025-04-12T15:45:54,154
DOGE was always a scam. This part of a scam is called *the exit*.,MrYdobon,2025-04-12T15:25:09,168
And the $150 billion is questionable at best because heâ€™s just cutting departments that he doesnâ€™t like.  Itâ€™s not actually waste.,HereWeGo5566,2025-04-12T17:03:05,45
"Irreparable damage to our government for a pittance of savings. Fuck off, Elon.",sketchahedron,2025-04-12T16:06:20,58
Musk has no proof.  He's just grifting like Trump. Anything for his advantage no matter how much it hurts Americans.,iijoanna,2025-04-12T17:29:04,13

"At best, the $2T cut was over 10 years. These lying MFers are a disgrace, exceeded only by the rubes who believe/support them.",Woody_CTA102,2025-04-12T18:51:39,10

And that $150 billion was getting rid of essential services.,Jasoncatt,2025-04-12T21:41:23,5
MAGAs ran around touting how much money DOGE was going to save. They may save 150 billion but are going to cost a significant amount due to the IRS cuts and also potential economic downturn in the future.,perilous_times,2025-04-12T20:37:02,5
And theyâ€™ll still not be able to find enough to cut to hit this number,annaleigh13,2025-04-12T18:22:57,3
Any details on how much Musk will be making as Twitter becomes the official platform for announcing Medicare distribution?,Zodep,2025-04-12T20:10:54,3
"He said heâ€™s not batting 1000.  It turns out this unelected bureaucrat knows nothing about government, governing, or the role of government.  Itâ€™s grifting all the way down in this administration.",JDogg126,2025-04-13T01:09:38,3
"Where's that $150 billion going, Elon?   And how many more billions is this ""savings"" going to cost us over the next 20 years?",FredFredrickson,2025-04-13T03:09:57,3

Huh...maybe there isn't as much government waste as they thought...Bunch of Failures.,Nearbyatom,2025-04-12T23:00:39,2
"What a fucking joke. Where are all the MAGA morons who are saying about the billions of dollars of fraud they found?!? Oh thatâ€™s right, there was no fraud, just woke programs to help people that the fascist Republican Party didnâ€™t like.",ChangingmynametoJT,2025-04-13T00:54:18,2
Now where will they find their tax break for billionaires? Goodbye Medicaid and SS. ðŸ˜¡,ChangingmynametoJT,2025-04-13T00:54:48,2
And before the end of the year that number will drop down to 50b. And then deduce the cost of all damage caused. We're almost at a negative here.,Orshabaalle,2025-04-13T02:26:43,2
I think the Chinese tariffs and this announcement are Elon and trump having a pissing contest.,ranaparvus,2025-04-13T05:07:48,2

"So, put another way, completely disrupting the functioning of multiple government agencies, upending lives and entire communities only saved slightly more than the net worth on one person.",nsfbr11,2025-04-13T09:23:28,2

"And It's clear he's not going to make it.        We're already up $125B from this time last year, so whatever he is doing isn't making a difference.  His ""savings"" numbers are frequently wrong and/or misleading.        Also, many of the things his team actually are doing will wind up costing us a lot more in the long run.  For example, firing all those IRS workers is projected to increase the deficit by $500B or more from uncollected taxes.  And the laid off workers that have to be re-hired will now have to work overtime to catch up.  This is the normal after a government shutdown.   I predict we will be about $700B deeper in the hole due to DOGE's bumbling, and another $1T in the hole from the GOP tax cuts to the billionaires.  There is no way jacking up taxes on the poorer 99% of the population can cover the billions the GOP wants to give away to the ultra wealthy.",guttanzer,2025-04-12T16:16:51,47
"Nice data. We all know DOGE is a scam. Musk after stealing the data from all Americans, is looking to leave the goverment.....I only hope someday he will be held accountable",Interesting-Ask9935,2025-04-12T15:58:20,21

"For what it may be worth, saving $2T was Ramaswamy's idea.  Then he bailed and Trump tasked Musk to do it.  Musk was originally going to the 'efficiency' guy.",crucial_geek,2025-04-12T23:13:10,3

"Is he really though?  Stealing data, that is?  I think he mostly just wanted to ensure that the Fed cases against him were dropped and that he can secure even more $$$$ in Government contracts.",crucial_geek,2025-04-12T23:04:39,6

"It will take time.  What they are doing is ensuring that each Agency gets a heckofalot less money over the next few years during appropriations.  Assuming Trump is gone for good and Vance does not win, it would still take years.  The best hope that we have is that if there is a Blue Wave in 2026 and 2028, that they get their shit together and make things into law.  Dems had the chance when Biden won in 2020, but for whatever reason, because Dems are gonna be Dems, they slept on the opportunity to legislate and intact lasting policies.",crucial_geek,2025-04-12T23:10:08,6
"I agree. And remove any barriers for himself in the process. He went after regulators in aeronautics right away (head of transportation security admin), the CFPB, the IRS. Funny how we couldn't afford to trim back any of his DOD contracts.",Strict_Inspection285,2025-04-13T10:29:42,1

"He also zeroed in and immediately attacked USAID, because he has a personal beef with them, due to their role in helping to end South African Apartheid, which enraged the Musk family, so they fled to Canada afterward.",LivingIndependence,2025-04-13T14:48:44,2
