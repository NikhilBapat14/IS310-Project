"This is a madhouse. Doesn't this basically mean any citizen can be abducted?

">*One of Trump’s top aides, Stephen Miller, confirmed publicly Friday that the administration was “actively looking at” suspending habeas corpus, adding that it “depends on whether the courts do the right thing or not.”*  So Stephen Miller is ""actively looking at"" suspending habeas corpus? Cool, I’m sure he’d be totally fine with a bunch of masked, unidentified guys—let’s say dressed like ICE or pretending to be some rogue paramilitary force—snatching *him* off the street without a warrant, legal representation, or any formal charges. After all, if we’re ditching habeas corpus, who needs due process? Just say he’s a suspected terrorist and poof—no lawyer, no court date, no rights. That’s how this works, right?  This is why suspending habeas corpus is so dangerous—it’s not a partisan issue, it’s a basic civil liberty. Once you allow the government to imprison people without charge or trial, ***NO ONE*** is safe—not even the ones who thought they’d be the ones holding the leash. History makes this clear: when Abraham Lincoln suspended habeas corpus during the Civil War, it sparked huge controversy and was limited by the courts and Congress (Ex parte Merryman, 1861). We don't need to go down that road again.  You don’t build a free society by shredding the foundational safeguards of liberty. If Miller wants to throw out habeas corpus, he might just be first in line to learn why it existed in the first place.",haiku2572,2025-05-09T21:06:18,22

"Part of the problem is that institutions with the power to fight back are democratically-minded, and they just watched Trump win the election. It's one thing to coup a tyrant, and quite another to oppose an elected leader who is simply doing what he promised. For some, not opposing the perceived mandate is a matter of principle. For others, they simply don't want the mob showing up at their door.   Every check and balance we have is backstopped by the democratic process. None of it matters without the support of voters; not Congress, not the Courts, surely not our Sacred Norms. Trump ran to be a dictator on day one, and the monstrously stupid electorate said ""YES!"" Much as I'd like to blame John Roberts (and he surely deserves some), the ones to blame for this are We The People. We fucked this up, and only we can fix it.
