"He's really really dumb  > In recent weeks, Trump has privately griped to advisers that Putin doesn’t want to end the war, and that both sides refuse to compromise. Trump has also asked advisers if they believe Putin has changed since Trump’s last time in office, and expressed surprise at some of Putin’s military moves, including bombing areas with children.",Rock-n-roll-Kevin,2025-05-10T11:21:29,1

Trump thought ending wars and inflation would be as easy as him getting a Diet Coke by pressing a button on his desk. What a moron...,dr_z0idberg_md,2025-05-10T11:42:57,1
">The president has told donors resolving the conflicts has been more difficult than he thought      When President Trump spoke to a room of top donors at his Florida club last week, he described ending [Russia’s war in Ukraine](https://www.wsj.com/world/russia-ukraine-intensify-attacks-ahead-of-moscows-world-war-ii-commemoration-25884ce4?mod=article_inline) as a growing frustration that keeps him up at night, people in the room said.  Why did he ever think it would be easy??? Did he actually believe he would end it in 24 hours? What a useless idiot. How awful for the Ukrainian people to know that the leader of America -- supposedly Ukraine's biggest ally -- has no idea what he's doing.",sachiprecious,2025-05-10T11:41:19,1

It’s insane he clearly doesn’t understand the dynamics of this war. If the incentives are not simply economic he is completely lost. He literally only sees the world through the lens of business and finance. And not even in a way that operates in good faith. His whole model for everything is there’s a bad faith economic lever to pull in all situations. Sure that sometimes can work but if all you do is use the stick and never present the carrot you will eventually lose. It’s so easy to take advantage of Trump. I wish people would stop buying the propaganda.,hmr0987,2025-05-10T11:43:18,1
