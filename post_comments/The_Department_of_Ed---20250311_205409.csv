"He's lying.  The department will not be able to meet its statutory obligations with such a massive staffing cut.  Many of the obligations were only being met if you squinted at them while looking sideways already.    This will hurt rural areas most.  But don't worry, the private sector will step up.  That will cost more and provide worse results, but Devos and friends will make a ton more money than before.",tosser1579,2025-03-11T21:00:55,665

"They're also claiming that they can cut 50% of the IRS and still meet the statutory obligations which is absurd because the IRS doesn't meet them now. Hold times on calls are way too long (hours), some kinds of cases aren't resolved in 6 months or more, and there are a lot of simple examinations and collections that don't get done before the statute expires. Let alone actually auditing the rich at the level needed to discourage cheating.  The President probably has the right to not fully use the funds provided by Congress if the goals of the legislation is met.

"After six years as a government contractor—including stints in the Pentagon, I witnessed a bloated system where cutting half the staff would hardly affect operations (except maybe cleaner bathrooms). Too many government employees lacking real expertise, leaving contractors to do the heavy lifting while they oversaw pointless meetings, note-taking, email crafting, and PowerPoint marathons. That said, I hate that anyone has to lose their job; I just hope inefficiencies are addressed across all agencies and not just the politically convenient ones.   My fix: remove any benefits of having previous military or gov experience when applying for jobs, cut contractors out completely, and hire the right people with the right expertise to do the job. 5 talented, qualified people are better than 10 unqualified government employees and 10 qualified contractors whose entire incentive is not to fix the problems but make the problems as painless as possible.

Folks remember the federal education department only funds about 10% of K-12 education. Most funding and power is at state and local levels.    In the past 40 years K-12 funding inflation adjusted has doubled. Student achievement did not move much.    Number of administrators in both K-12 and higher education have dramatically increased. Part of the reason is dealing with federal red tape.    The Department does have a powerful role in federal student loans. The updated FAFSA rollout the Department recently tried was a complete disaster. The Department failed to implement the new form on time. It really messed up a cycle of college enrollment because the Department could not hire IT contractors fast enough to do the job. Among stupid failures the contract bidding started too late.    Simplify the processes in the Department and attach less strings on the federal funding. Money is getting wasted on red tape.,personAAA,2025-03-11T22:09:26,-1

"At this point, the largest documented specific thing I can find is the IES (Institute for Education Science). They do mostly long term research studies. Also 89 contracts and 29 grants have been cancelled.   So long term research into education is being thrown 100% back on the states and private industry. Some contracts and grants will be frozen, so if you or your school district is receiving funding through these grants it will dry up.  Consider that US manufacturing employment peaked in 1979, but  manufacturing output has actually increased significantly since then. We are doing much more with much less people, through technology and innovation. Consider then that government agencies are multiple decades behind on these types of innovations.

"For my friends who want the Department of Education to remain untouched I'd like to ask a question. What exactly does the Department of Education do that States are constitutionally prohibited from doing?  From my perspective, when the electorate is deeply split on an issue, the best solution where possible is to allow each state to do their own thing. Yes, I'm aware that the ones that don't implement your preferred policy will suffer dire consequences, but dire consequences is a far more effective means of changing minds than imposing your will on them.  if the blue states loved what the Department of Education was doing, well then they can take up those initiatives themselves. If the education system of red states will crumble without the Federal government's support, well maybe that will help them change their minds.

"The real issue is the word games with ""statutory obligations"" as opposed to ""statutory authorities."" For example, the Dept of Ed Organizing Act says there is an Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights, and the ASCR has to submit an annual report to the SecEd, President, and Congress ""summarizing the compliance and enforcement activities of the Office for Civil Rights and identifying significant civil rights or compliance problems as to which such Office has made a recommendation for corrective action and as to which, in the judgment of the Assistant Secretary, adequate progress is not being made.""  That's it. That's the only ""statutory obligation"" that the ASCR has. The Act goes on to give the ASCR the authority collect data, appoint officers, do legal analysis, etc., but those are ""authorities"" not ""obligations."" The only ""obligation"" is the report, and there is no ""statutory obligation"" for details, so the report could literally state ""The Office of Civil Rights conducted no compliance or enforcement activities, and has not identified any civil rights or compliance issues for corrective action and to which inadequate progress is being made. -V/r, xoxo, ASCR Asskisser""  There's a lot of stuff the Office of Civil Rights *can* do and they are *generally expected* to do, but very little they are actually *statutorily required* to do (most of the expectations come from agency regulations and policy... which is one reason the current administration is so big on eliminating, er, ""streamlining"" regulation and putting yes-people in ""policy"" positions).

Imagine the only free resource that you pay into teaches your child things you don’t want taught that are not within the basic margins of education. Some would say to just take the child out of school, but why? We are seeing a major uprise in homeschooling which in return takes money away from the public schools. The real solution would be to discard the new ideologies that we are not agreeing on. Just teach the basics.

"If the right knows how to educate, why are democrats smarter and better educated across the board?  Why are democrats much more adept at critical thinking?  Many factors can explain why Democratic voters are more focused on critical thinking:  Education: Studies show that people with higher education levels, like college degrees, are more likely to vote Democratic. Higher education promotes critical thinking skills, like analyzing evidence and considering different perspectives, which is often aligned with liberal values.  Cognitive Flexibility: Democratic voters tend to be more open-minded and comfortable with complexity, which helps with critical thinking. Liberal ideologies often involve more abstract ideas and systemic thinking, which can require greater cognitive flexibility.  Evidence-Based Reasoning: Democrats often prioritize science and evidence-based policies, which align with critical thinking. For example, they tend to support policies backed by data on climate change, healthcare, and public health.  Diversity of Opinion: Democratic values tend to promote diversity and inclusion, which encourages people to engage with different perspectives and refine their thinking.

"Even public schools in affluent areas of cities are entirely different than schools in poor areas. Schools in affluent areas simply have more money to spend for a couple of reasons: first, they are more likely to vote for higher taxes for funding schools. That means the schools themselves and bigger, newer, nicer, and have more teachers, more subjects available to be taught, and bigger staffs. Those schools simply attract better students whose parents have high expectations for what their child can achieve.  Those schools also enjoy lots of parental support, both financial and in the amount of time donated.   Schools in poorer areas have none of that. Parents are less likely to pass bond issues to fund the schools. Both parents often work, which means they have less time available to volunteer to,provide services for the schools. The same level of financial support for extra-curricular activities might well not be available. Those schools subsist on fewer teachers, a smaller range of subjects taught, less parental involvement, and lower expectations generally.  The only private school in the small city where I grew up was a catholic high school. It catered to a very affluent area of town. It was much smaller than the public schools from which it drew students, so it couldn’t compete in sports teams. Technically, the catholic kids could still play sports at one of the public schools, but I don’t remember that being a frequent occurrence.

"> Two major functions of the Department of Ed that states cannot replicate are funding for special education and for Title I schools. It also manages student loans and the mechanism of access to applying for those loans. Therefore, the idea of leaving it up to the states is great for folks who can afford to send their kid to a private school or have the time and resources to homeschool.    The question that that inevitably leads to is still why DoE needs to exist in the first place, because as currently constituted it’s just an extra layer of bureaucracy between the Treasury and the recipients of the funding.     > For everyone else, well, we already know that some states just don’t care about education ( most of the south), so do you really believe they’ll be eager to find funding for special education students? And Title I schools already have tremendous struggles, are the kids at those schools just not important enough to worry about? Zip code already determines far too much of a child’s prospects, leaving it up to the states is certainly not a way to further those young people’s futures.    Leaving out that US educational achievement has stagnated since the 1970s, there’s still nothing there that requires a bespoke Cabinet level department to disburse the funding in addition to the layers of bureaucracy at the Treasury that the money already passes through before it even gets to DoE.",DanforthWhitcomb_,2025-03-11T22:25:34,1

Again, I don't think there's anything in the constitution that would prevent a school from having their own state level loan program.

"That's the problem with ""compliance"" and ""controls"" type functions. They aren't dependent on finding something wrong, but the job is to find something *when* it's wrong. But when they don't ""find"" something wrong, people who don't know about the nature of controls (and deterrence) think the function is a waste. Think about a security guard patrolling a site - if they never stop anybody, are they a waste? Or is their mere presence deterring potential intrusions that wind up never happening? And if it's the latter, how do you prove it? Or for a more visceral example, are NFL refs a waste if they never throw a ""roughing the passer"" flag, or does the mere fact that there's somebody there ready to throw a flag make rushers pull up before launching into a late hit?  There's certainly an aspect of ""justifying the job."" And sometimes that gets into ticky-tacky ""fouls"" being called. But in my experience (over a decade in oversight roles), that kind of thing is more about over-zealousness of the assessor than about justification. And there's the idea that there's always something to find (the very first forensic accounting partner I ever worked under flat-out said ""If you've been on more than two audits and haven't found fraud, it's because you're not looking in the right places for it."" Or to go back to the football example, a ref could throw a holding penalty on pretty much any lineman on any play, so ""holding"" becomes more about whether something impacted the play than whether it happened or not.). It's all part of the role, that some people are more or less suited for.  We also have the issue of job metrics. If ""keeping your job"" relies on finding problems (or writing tickets), then that's what you get, because the worker is incentivized to perform to the metric. So performance management comes into play as well.  So all that to say... you're not necessarily *wrong* that it's bad for a job to be based on finding problems. But it's also not really true that compliance and oversight is only about finding problems (at least in a competent organization).",Corellian_Browncoat,2025-03-12T08:34:13,10

They don't agree with LGBTQ related topics. And sometimes things that they can't even define, like critical race theory. When it comes to critical race theory, that isn't taught below the collegiate level, but what conservatives think it is is making the US and by extension white southerners look bad by teaching the unvarnished trith about slavery. Hence the push in recent years to make it seem like slavery wasn't so bad. Or that the Civil War was fought over states rights.   Also, people like the OP believe that schools are teaching lessons that encourage their children to be homosexual or Trans. This is patently false. In only six states is there any mention at all of anything LGBTQ related in state mandated curriculum. And that inclusion usually includes things like instruction inclusive of same sex relationships and teaching about identity and gender expression.   In other words, they teach the kids that LGBTQ people exist. Not encouraging them to become gay or Trans.

"POTUS impoundment of funds has been going on since 1803 when Jefferson refused to spend $50,000 for gunboats to protect navigation on the Mississippi from Spain because we bought Louisiana and it was no longer an issue. In 1949, Truman tried to IMPOUND funds Congress approved for the B-36 bomber (cut about 300 of them) because he knew the B-52 was waiting in the wings. Congress overruled him. In 1959, Ike impounded $334Million because he considered it a waste of money. Congress overruled him as well and went on to pass the Impoundment Control Act which set rules for POTUS to change the Budget Authority (basically the details of how Congress says the appropriations are to be spent). Main point is POTUS must notify Congress of exactly what and why cuts should be made. Trump already ignored the ICA in 2017 re funds for Ukraine opting instead to simply delay the release of the funds. After a few weeks, he relented and released the funds.

"Sort of but no not exactly - I'm asking from the premise that every child still has access to the funds that the government is spending on the school system today (per child, like some states are arguing for). And not just non-profits but genuine good faith educators that may be able to allocate more time to each child instead of being sometimes overwhelmed (more on that later).  Does no one see a world where that works out? Wouldn't ""private"" schooling become more accessible to more people that could ""top up"" the government funds they receive? Is there not the possibility of more schools with smaller class sizes, especially if public schools still exist?  Again, genuine questions. I'm not sure I've ever been given a super coherent answer that isn't rooted in disdain for a political party or capitalism/privatization of things on a whole. I'm not even arguing on behalf of the scenario I'm proposing, I'm just asking what specifically people don't think would work.  Two things seem to be often and immediately dismissed: that the public/private approach is already used in Universities and that partial privatization that's more accessible(to wit, that a portion of all is still federally funded) means competition - having to produce a better ""product"" (eg schooling) at competitive rates.  Again just asking questions to hear perspectives, not necessarily arguing one way or the other.  EDIT: Someone mentioned in another thread that without standardization of curriculum the government funded portion could be used to send kids to schools that are teaching really bad ideas. Solid point, that'd for sure have to be considered.

"""why do states receive federal funding for education?""   Great question! Federal funding for education serves a few key purposes:  Equalizing Resources: Different states and districts have varying levels of local revenue, primarily from property taxes. Federal funds help ensure that students in low-income areas have access to a quality education by supplementing state and local funds.  Addressing Specific Needs: Federal programs target particular student groups who might need extra support. For example, Title I funding is specifically for schools with high percentages of low-income students to help them meet educational goals.  Supporting Special Programs: Federal funds are also allocated to special programs like special education (IDEA), English language learning, and vocational education. These funds help create and sustain programs that might otherwise be unaffordable for states and districts.  Innovation and Improvement: Federal grants and funding can spur educational innovation and reform. For example, programs like Race to the Top provide incentives for states to adopt ambitious plans for educational improvements.  So, in essence, federal funding aims to level the playing field, address specific needs, and encourage improvements in education across the country.

Title II: Focused on teacher and principal training and recruiting to improve teacher quality and effectiveness.  Title III: Supports language instruction for English learners and immigrant students, ensuring they attain English proficiency and meet the same academic content and achievement standards as their peers.  Title IV: This part has multiple subparts, including:  Title IV-A: Student Support and Academic Enrichment Grants to improve students' academic achievement by increasing the capacity of states, school districts, schools, and local communities.  Title IV-B: 21st Century Community Learning Centers to provide opportunities for communities to establish or expand activities in community learning centers.  Title V: Supports state innovation and flexibility in spending federal funds.  Title VI: Aims to address the unique needs of rural school districts, focusing on providing financial assistance to rural and low-income schools.

It ignores that there's a *whole section in Project 2025 about how to use USAid to achieve administration goals*. What Trump is doing is fundamentally different.  * https://www.project2025.observer/?agencies=U.S.+Agency+for+Global+Media - one is ""in progress"" BECAUSE ELON MUSK TWEETED SOMETHING.  This isn't serious analysis.  The one that's ""completed"" is based on reporting from anonymous sources in one newspaper.   * https://www.project2025.observer/?agencies=Commodity+Futures+Trading+Commission - apparently, exploring adding cryptocurrency to existing foreign swap regulations is actually *reducing* regulations?

"You are moving in circles, again any power not assigned to the President by the Constitution moves to the states and the people.

"This statement is a mix of ignorance, logical fallacies, and conservative political motivation designed to justify executive overreach while dismissing legal and constitutional constraints. Let's break it down:   ---  1. Profound Ignorance of Law & Government Structure  ""It’s not a violation of anything— the Constitution doesn’t mandate staffing levels of departments within the executive branch.""  The Constitution explicitly grants Congress the power to structure and fund the executive branch (Article I, Section 8). While it doesn’t specify the number of employees per department, it does give Congress control over appropriations, oversight, and the creation of executive agencies.  The Appointments Clause (Article II, Section 2) requires Senate approval for certain executive positions. The president cannot unilaterally reshape the government without congressional authorization.  Agencies operate under statutory mandates, meaning Congress sets their responsibilities, which inherently influences staffing needs. Reducing staff to undermine a department’s function can violate laws requiring that agency to fulfill its duties.   ""Nobody asked Congress when they hired someone.""  This is absurd. Congress creates, funds, and oversees executive branch positions. Agencies don’t just randomly hire people—staffing follows congressional budgets, civil service laws, and agency mandates.  Many senior positions require Senate confirmation, meaning Congress is directly involved in executive staffing.     ---  2. Logical Fallacies & Bad Faith Framing  Strawman Argument: No one claims the Constitution dictates exact staffing numbers. The issue is whether reducing staffing levels violates statutory obligations or undermines government functions.  False Equivalence: The idea that “nobody asked Congress when they hired someone” equates routine hiring with dismantling or defunding an agency—two completely different things.  Appeal to Executive Power: This frames the executive branch as having unilateral control over its workforce, ignoring Congress’s constitutional role in governance.    ---  3. Conservative Political Motivation: Undermining Government to Justify Executive Overreach  This reflects right-wing efforts to hollow out government agencies (especially regulatory ones) under the pretense of “downsizing bureaucracy.” Trump-era conservatives pushed this strategy to weaken agencies like the EPA, DOJ, and IRS while claiming it was just an administrative decision.  The argument minimizes Congressional oversight and legislative authority, echoing authoritarian tendencies in the modern conservative movement—pushing unchecked executive power while ignoring constitutional checks and balances.  This rhetoric also serves to justify government dysfunction—by gutting agencies, conservatives can later argue that they’re “ineffective” and push for further dismantling.    ---  Conclusion: A Bad-Faith Defense of Executive Overreach  This statement is not just ignorant—it’s designed to mislead. It distorts constitutional governance, ignores congressional authority, and serves as a pretext for dismantling government functions under a false constitutional argument.  It’s another example of weaponized stupidity, where deliberate misinterpretation of laws is used to justify authoritarian-style executive action while pretending it’s just “common sense.”",Kinks4Kelly,2025-03-13T11:51:33,1
