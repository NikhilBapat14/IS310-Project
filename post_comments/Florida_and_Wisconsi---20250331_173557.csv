"Please please vote!  What most people don't realize, is the out of 245 million people eligible to vote, a full 89 million didn't.  77 million for Trump, 75 million for Harris, 4 million independent, and 89 million didn't.  That means Trump didn't even get 1/3 of the vote!!!  1/3 of 245 million is almost 82 million.  If only people had voted...",PedricksCorner,2025-03-31T19:05:12,9

"I'm not in Florida anymore, unfortunately. But, very close to Kentucky, and you can be sure I'll be supporting the Democrat running for Mitch McConnell's seat in 26. Hoping and praying Andy Beshear decides to run.",MiaStirCrazies,2025-03-31T18:47:03,10
"Well, Ashley Moody is up for re-election in 26. Another chance to send a big message.",MiaStirCrazies,2025-03-31T17:48:35,12

"I'm sure he's got presidential aspirations. But, for the good of the country here. Kentucky is one of four that we need to flip the Senate in 26. We can hope.",MiaStirCrazies,2025-03-31T19:39:36,1
"We can hope, but it doesn't always translate... look at Hogan in MD. I think it would take literal divine intervention for a Dem to win a federal, statewide race.",philafly7475,2025-03-31T19:58:31,1
"Tough, for sure. And this is a deeply red, deeply beloved (yuck) life long Senator. I'm sitting here in Huntington, WV, on the KY border, screaming from the rooftop that KY has a path to one of the four needed to flip the Senate.",MiaStirCrazies,2025-03-31T20:02:43,1
