"This most likely wouldn’t actually save any kids. The only reason an abuser would confess this to a priest is because the priest can’t tell anyone. If you change that, people simply stop confessing it.   Doesn’t seem very productive, except I guess the few kids who could be saved during the transition period before word got out that the rule changed.",lll_lll_lll,2025-05-07T12:09:12,56
"I'm not even Catholic and I know that's a bad headline. The church is not excommunicating anyone in this case. What happens is that if a priest chooses to violate their oath, that priest has excommunicated themselves from the church.",TexasPeteEnthusiast,2025-05-07T12:28:24,54
"I would say that information obtained during confession should be similar to attorney-client privilege. You might as well pass a law saying that God is now a mandatory reporter.    Short of confession, however, sure, Priests should be mandatory reporters. Really just about everyone should be a mandatory reporter. If you become aware that a child is being molested and you don't go to the authorities, you're pretty much an accomplice.",Mountain_Man_88,2025-05-07T08:31:13,117
"Reconciliation is a sacrament of the Catholic Church and is considered even more inviolable than attorney client privilege.  Priests that hear confession are subject to one set of laws and one only...and they're not the secular state's rules.  I would be exceptionally surprised to hear about any priest that violated the sanctity of the sacrament of reconciliation and any that did, especially if their excuse is a state law, absolutely deserves to be excommunicated.  This isn't to say that not dropping a dime on child abusers is to be encouraged but it's curious the state of Washington thought to target religious orders while ignoring applying the same standard to attorneys (who, I'm rather sure, make up a fair chunk of the elected representatives who proposed and passed this law).  Spouses cannot be compelled to testify against one another and that is directly due to the sacrament of marriage.  What's next...arresting priests who perform the sacrament of baptism during a water restriction?  The good news about this law is that if the reverse happens (the state charging a priest who didn't disclose the contents of a confession), the courts will immediately strike down the law as a violation of the 1st Amendment's prohibition of the government interfering in the free exercise of religion.",Euroranger,2025-05-07T11:31:08,61

That one priest who gets his JD will have a long line at his confessional.,Papa_Ganda,2025-05-07T11:32:50,14
"The whole Catholic confessional to a priest is unbiblical and a man made control mechanism  1. **Unbiblical Mediation** – Scripture teaches that Christ alone is our mediator (1 Timothy 2:5), and we can confess sins directly to God (1 John 1:9). Nowhere does the Bible require confession through a priest.    2. **No Priestly Absolution in Scripture** – While James 5:16 encourages mutual confession among believers, it doesn’t establish a priestly sacrament with the power to forgive sins—only God can do that (Mark 2:7).  (I won't even get into the fact that Catholic priests don't meet the biblical qualifications for a pastor or an elder that are clearly defined in scripture)  3. **Historical Control Mechanism** – The formal confessional system developed later, becoming a tool for institutional control. By claiming exclusive authority to absolve sins, the Church wielded psychological and political power, often exploiting penitents through coercion, indulgences, and secrecy.    True repentance requires no human intermediary—only faith in Christ. The confessional system undermines the sufficiency of His sacrifice and provides ample opportunity for blackmail and control.   When Christ died the veil in the temple was torn by God removing the roll of the priest to mediate between us and God.",tacocookietime,2025-05-07T13:57:42,-7

"I did, and I can understand it if we were talking about cases where the sin is in the past or even years old. But if someone confesses actively or patterns of harming people, especially children, I think there needs to be some mechanism for protecting the innocent.   and maybe I am just ignorant of the confession process, if a diddler comes in and confesses that they are actively engaging in the crime, or have repeatedly done this in the recent past, is there anything the priest can do to save the children from further harm?   Like lawyers are required in some jurisdictions to report if [a child is face death or substantial bodily harm](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/public_interest/child_law/resources/child_law_practiceonline/child_law_practice/vol-34/november-2015/rule-limits-when-attorneys-may-report-child-abuse/#:~:text=Absent%20client%20consent%20an%20attorney%20may%20not,the%20committee%20said%20they%20%E2%80%9Cmust%E2%80%9D%20do%20so.).   But hey, I'm a Sola Scriptura sort of guy and I'm not seeing any evidence that the bible talks about putting mans rules on confession above keeping a child from being molested. That seems like a Pharisaical thing. It would even seem like the act of excommunication done in 1 Corinthians 5:1–5 would imply that people taking part in sin do not get to use the church as a cover for their actions.  And even at the heart of the conversation, if a catholic person feels that they need to confess to be right with God, but they are currently engaging with sin and are not stopping that sin, are they fearing mans consequences more than God's? If being reported for harming children is enough to stop them from confession, then are they truly repentant?",LeeroyJenkins11,2025-05-07T11:03:43,9

"\>is there anything the priest can do to save the children from further harm?  ""You are not absolved if you do not face worldly justice."" (And this happens.) ***Repenting is a package that contains confession along with other things,*** there's also paying for what a person did (potentially to include turning one's self in, especially where it matters most) and also to *stop sinning.*  If we're to turn priests into obligated state reporters, then why not ***lawyers?*** Lawyers hear about vastly higher volumes of crime than priests do, but they don't report it. The logic that we'd protect the public by turning priests into state reporters catches an even larger number of hypothetical criminals - therefore MORE protecting the public -  if *lawyers* are made into obligated state reporters.  **Why** don't we do it? Because it would bring their operations to a complete halt(\*) just as it would do for priests, which is probably the whole point of the rule in the first place. It doesn't make the public any safer it just points a giant weapon at one particular group while saying ""if you oppose this, you're GUILTY!"" It's textbook Kafka.  # (*)also meaning the actual gains would be ZERO, NOTHING  Priests doctors and lawyers' private conversations are traditionally legally protected for similar reasons, this is just a little room of politicians trying to kick priests **(and therefore religious followers)** out of the group.

"These are all excellent points and you’ve backed them up with scripture. Something you need to realize though is that many, I would even argue most, Catholics put papal decrees and Catholic traditions above actual written scripture. They pray to the saints, they confess to a priest instead of asking God directly for forgiveness. Just look at the replies to your comment. “We’ve done this church tradition for thousands of years.” The older I get and the more I interact with Catholics the more I’ve come to realize that many of them view non-Catholic Christians as heretics, so don’t be surprised if your points fall on willfully deaf ears.",MulticamTropic,2025-05-07T12:21:13,-3

"So I get what you’re saying. I do actually think that crimes committed against kids should come with harsher consequences. In cases of abuse it could go on for years, and be a family member or a close friend of the family where no one else knows what’s going on. In the other instances you mentioned, a spouse could seek protection from the police, get a restraining order, etc.. and someone murdered is no longer suffering so that crime is as bad as it will get unless the person is a serial killer (which I would hope would be reported, but I think I know the answer that it’s not). With children, they are dependent on the good people around them to protect them. Even outside of confessional, child abuse is often ignored or covered up in religious organizations. Any time you have a community where children are it’s a risk.  I appreciate your opinions and how cordially you’ve discussed this topic with me. I know mine isn’t a popular take on this thread.",Szorja,2025-05-08T13:11:12,2
">We're talking about Catholicism. A religion that *predates* the bible by a few hundred years if we measure from date of compilation or a few generations if we measure from date of earliest writing from the New Testament.  😂 The earliest New Testament writing is widely considered to be 1 Thessalonians, written by the Apostle Paul around AD 49–51.  ### **1. The Church ≠ Biblical Authority**   Just because Catholicism predates the formal compilation of the Bible doesn’t mean its later traditions (like mandatory priestly confession) carry divine authority. The early Church operated under apostolic teaching (Acts 2:42), not a medieval sacramental system.    ### **2. Jesus and the Apostles Never Instituted Confession to Priests**   - Christ granted forgiveness **directly** (Luke 7:48, John 8:11) and taught His followers to pray to the **Father** (Matthew 6:9-12).   - The apostles declared forgiveness through the **Gospel** (Acts 10:43), not a ritual absolution by clergy.   - James 5:16 refers to mutual confession among believers, not a priestly sacrament.    ### **3. Historical Development ≠ Divine Origin**   - Early Christians confessed **publicly** or **to God**—not privately to priests. The formal confessional system emerged **centuries later** (6th–12th centuries) as a means of Church discipline.   - If Catholicism’s antiquity proves legitimacy, then **older Jewish traditions** (like the priesthood) should still be binding—yet Catholicism rejects them.    ### **4. Control, Not Scripture, Drove the System**   - The medieval Church weaponized confession (e.g., withholding absolution for political obedience, selling indulgences).   - Christ warned against **human traditions** overriding God’s Word (Mark 7:6-9).    The Bible never mandates confession to priests—it’s a later **human tradition**. True forgiveness comes through Christ alone (1 John 1:9), not an institutional mediator.

"There is no ""Jewish consensus""  If there was Christianity would have never gotten started. Jews that accept Jesus are typically called Christians but some also go by Messianic Jews.  Some things are not up for interpretation. Scripture CLEARLY said when and where the Jewish Messiah would come. He had to come before the destruction of the second Temple. That happened in 70AD. It also said he would be rejected by many and a stumbling block. That happened. If Jesus wasn't the Jewish Messiah then there can't have been one. It's simple.",tacocookietime,2025-05-07T15:05:54,5
