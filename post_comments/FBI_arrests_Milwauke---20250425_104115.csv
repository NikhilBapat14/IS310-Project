"Now kash Patel and Pam bondis real value are going to start to show. Having an FBI and DOJ completely in lock step with the President willing to do whatever he wants to attack enemies and imprison them is how we get true authoritarianism.

"Fuck Trump and fuck the GOP. But there are two issues here. If she truly allowed the defendant to sneak out a back door and evade arrest, she should be prosecuted regardless of who is president. But at the same time, it’s bullshit for ICE to walk into a judge’s courtroom and effectuate an arrest. The local court has jurisdiction over that defendant. They should have nabbed him in the lobby after the hearing or, if he was in custody, had an order remanding him to federal custody for immigration proceedings. Instead they went cowboy and escalated the whole thing.",shmottlahb,2025-04-25T19:59:30,1
"There’s not much fact to comment on. I would expect the lady judge has no regret doing what she did and would do it again... She avoided scandal into her rooms... Considering, being undocumented is not a crime. That’s what is so wrong in the deportation scandal. People have been qualified ”qualified” and sent to foreign authorities and processed as such in a dreadful way, but there never was a court that ruled on the qualification. So, yes, a person was arrested and would have been arrested in the judge chamber without the judge, and so what ? Judges are told to rule in the light of their conscience, and I would gladly have to be judged by that woman instead of being judged by mrs Bondi, who could not even admit Donald Trump lost the 2020 election when asked to do so.

"My understanding is that ICE was accessing non-public areas of the courthouse without authorization and had no warrant to do so. They also did not have a judicial arrest warrant.  Arrests being made in a courthouse, and using court dates as a Honeypot to catch targeted persons, directly interferes with judiciarys's ability to conduct fair court proceedings free of intimidation and outside influence. People will be fearful of attending their court hearings, which makes them less likely to show up. ices goal here is to coerces people to waive their due process rights by being afraid to attend their hearing. Which in turns prevents the judge from conducting their lawful court proceedings.",Atomic_meatballs,2025-04-26T11:50:49,3
