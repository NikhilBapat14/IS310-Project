So, yes, a person was arrested and would have been arrested in the judge chamber without the judge, and so what ?

"My understanding is that ICE was accessing non-public areas of the courthouse without authorization and had no warrant to do so. They also did not have a judicial arrest warrant.  Arrests being made in a courthouse, and using court dates as a Honeypot to catch targeted persons, directly interferes with judiciarys's ability to conduct fair court proceedings free of intimidation and outside influence. People will be fearful of attending their court hearings, which makes them less likely to show up. ices goal here is to coerces people to waive their due process rights by being afraid to attend their hearing. Which in turns prevents the judge from conducting their lawful court proceedings.",Atomic_meatballs,2025-04-26T11:50:49,3
