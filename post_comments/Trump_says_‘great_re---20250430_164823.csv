I doubt it. I think Canada mostly fucking hate him now,shadowdra126,2025-04-30T16:53:33,24
The US has lost all credibility by reneging on agreements and treating longtime allies like garbage.  There is no relationship to build with Trump.,MagicBingo,2025-04-30T16:55:07,13
"It is in Carney‚Äôs best interest to negotiate as an equal and fix this tariff mess. Billionaires on both sides of the border will need this.  But the people of Canada have made up their mind. They are never favoring the US for products or vacations ever again. It takes a lot to break a Canadian, but once broken, it can‚Äôt be fixed. They are done with the US.",GrandFrogPrince,2025-04-30T16:56:05,10

Everything Trump touches turns to gold plated shit. Took a conservative candidate with a 25 point lead and flushed him down his gold toilet. Bravo Trump. For that Canada is better off.,williamgman,2025-04-30T19:47:08,3
Will he call him Prime Minister? Or continue with the Governer insult?,neutrino71,2025-04-30T16:54:15,2
"‚ÄúHe was running for office,‚Äù Trump said, speaking of Carney. ‚ÄúThey both hated Trump, and it was the one that hated Trump, I think, the least that won. I actually think the Conservative hated me much more than the so-called Liberal.‚Äù   I called this weeks ago. Trump wanted Carney to win, if for no other reason than he can't have actual conservatives being viewed as superior to him. The same reason why he's savagely gone after DeSantis and Massie and¬† has primaried a bunch of conservatives out of office in the USA.",Prestigious-Ad54,2025-04-30T16:54:36,2
Didn‚Äôt carney basically run on anti-trump?,BigManWAGun,2025-04-30T17:29:14,2
"a) either Carney has absolutely dogwalked him in meetings  b) trump admires strong take cahrge leaders and can't help himself from gushing even when he's on objectively the opposite side.    Doesn't matter if it's Putin, Claudia in Mexico, Xi, Kim Jong Un, Mark Carney, he just loves confident leaders who's people respect/worship them (obviously Carney and Putin are totally opposite, but both are currently popular in their own countries).    I lean towards B. Doesn't matter if it's Putin, Claudia in Mexico, Xi, Kim Jong Un, Mark Carney, he just loves confident leaders who's people respect/worship them (obviously Carney and Putin are totally opposite, but both are currently popular in their own countries). Trump doesn't care at all what people believe or do. He just sees they have clout, and he is jealous.",TheGroinOfTheFace,2025-04-30T17:40:23,2

Had roughly a 25 point lead  at the end of December of last year. Trump got back in to office and wiped that out. It's a direct rebuke of Trump and his insanity.,2_Spicy_2_Impeach,2025-04-30T16:59:51,12

"Carney is gonna 'negotiate' that idiot into the same hole Trudeau did, but deeper.  The whole time Donald is gonna be led to think he's making a screaming deal but it'll be nothing like he's imagining.   Donny doesn't have anyone to check or balance what's about to happen.  He's got Navarro who's a rube as well.   This is where you can watch some real 4d chess take place.  It's not even fair.  Fish in a barrel.",hundredsofpeaches,2025-04-30T17:11:36,6
"Yes and no, I'm a Canadian. His rhetoric was hostile to Trump and the US; but he has an entire policy plan and platform. This is a huge factor. Trump helped the Liberals; but the Conservatives had no platform except Trudeau bad. Which didn't inspire confidence alongside their Trump-light talking points. The vote looks close; but this was a fairly resounding rebuke of Trump style populism.   Typically Americans don't understand our politics; but the greatest enemy to the incumbent is time. The most important factor in the Conservatives popularity is Liberal fatigue which is why Pp was just low-effort coasting. Nearly without exception we switch parties every 6-8 years as a natural part of our political ecosystem and that was reflected in the early polling. It has a lot less to do with Trudeau actually being incompetent than people think. Disrupting this and awarding a 4th Liberal term in a row is historic.",Educational_Layer_57,2025-04-30T17:41:39,8
Maybe you could try mailing him enough poutine to kill a horse?,account312,2025-04-30T19:22:30,1
Are you going to act like the remaining votes went to nothing? The remaining % went to parties that form coalitions with the Liberal Party. That's a pretty cold rebuke of Poilievere.,alabasterskim,2025-04-30T17:24:46,8
"20% of Canada‚Äôs GDP comes from trade with the US. Carney isn‚Äôt stupid enough to just accept a 20% reduction in sale of products to the US. Eventually, that trade can go elsewhere. But not fast enough to stop a world of pain that a continuous trade war with a sociopathic narcissist like Trump will cause.  They can change their trading partners by 2030, not 2025.",GrandFrogPrince,2025-04-30T17:33:35,3
It's up to Canadian media not to dunk too hard on Trump after the fact and embarrass him.,mashmallownipples,2025-04-30T17:43:54,2
Plus it's a minority of those Conservative voters that approve of Trump's 51st state garbage.,NPRdude,2025-04-30T17:31:24,7
"I doubt very much Carney's goal is to stop trade with America.    But, as you say, this is not a stupid man we've elected. You can be sure a lot of eggs are going to be removed from the giant US basket and placed in a lot of other baskets.   China, for example, is already buying our crude at a record clip over the last 2 months. Hopefully this will continue and we get to a point where we no longer sell to the US at such a deep discount.   Ironically, that result would get rid of the trade surplus with America and there would be no reason to tariff other items coming from Canada.   China got it right after Trump 1.0 by diversifying trade because of the 2018 tariffs. We should have taken our cue from them at that time and done the same. Better late than never, though",biscuitarse,2025-04-30T18:13:28,6
