"David Hogg, do your work and primary this boomer out of the senate.  Edit: What I’m trying to say is that David Hogg can help a strong primary challenger defeat Schumer in 2028 (hopefully AOC).

"Well that's only to be expected when you fail to stand for anything at all, and completely fail to even attempt to use the levers available in the minority party in the senate to slow down or prevent an out of control authoritarian president from running amok.
