I don't think Putins nukes work.,GiediOne,2025-05-04T12:30:27,18
 im kind of surprised a dirty bomb has not been set off. No one would do anything.  it would turn into decade of investigations with no conclusive answer. Likely put blame on some small rogue group.,Hulluck22,2025-05-04T15:31:47,4
It's been some months since last nuclear saber rattling. Or did we just collectively tune it out,Dutchtdk,2025-05-04T17:43:25,2
Me too. I doubt they have enough duct tape to hold one together. Wouldn't that be embarrassing.,Icy-Mix-3977,2025-05-04T19:18:42,1
He's such a blowhard.,VeryPokey,2025-05-04T14:09:36,9
"They probably donâ€™t. But even so, if he uses nuclear weapons in Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ which is On the western border of Russia, it would be insane because the fallout would blow over and land in and on Russia!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-05-04T12:48:54,12
Would be kind of hilarious if he launches one and it's a dud.,Helio2nd,2025-05-04T22:01:36,2
They probably do but when itâ€™s a war of conquest for valuable land it doesnâ€™t strike me as terribly likely he uses them. We canâ€™t discount even a 3% chance anybody uses them so you have to take it serious but I think the type of war heâ€™s fighting it doesnâ€™t make sense to use them unless heâ€™s looking at total governed collapse or something insane like that,YoNoSoyUnFederale,2025-05-04T14:16:20,3
