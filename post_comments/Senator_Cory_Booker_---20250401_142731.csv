There was a friendly back and forth between Sen. Booker and Sen. Mark Kelly. Booker was joking about Kelly appearing in the [New Jersey Hall of Fame](https://www.nj.com/news/2023/02/njs-mark-kelly-to-join-us-astronaut-hall-of-fame.html).,progress18,2025-04-01T16:31:25,7
"Sen. Booker is now talking about this NYT article and quoting some experts:  >[The Budget Trick the G.O.P. Might Use to Make a $4 Trillion Tax Cut Look Free](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/17/upshot/budget-baseline-metaphors-republicans.html)  >...  >Republicans in Congress trying to advance a giant bill that includes $4 trillion in tax cut extensions are considering a novel strategy that would make the extension appear to be free. The trick: budgeting with the assumption that current policies extend indefinitely into the future ‚Äî even those with an expiration date, like the 2017 tax cuts set to end next year. It‚Äôs the difference between making the extension appear to cost $4 trillion or zero.  >Using this ‚Äúcurrent policy baseline‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt change the bill‚Äôs real effect on deficits or debt. But it would make it easier to actually make the tax cuts lasting by sidestepping a rule governing budget reconciliation, the process Republicans are using to pass the bill.  >>‚ÄúIf budget reconciliation is like taking the express lanes on a highway (there‚Äôs extra rules and tolls, limited stops, but it gets you to where you want to go faster), using a current policy baseline for taxes is like slapping a fake license plate on your car.‚Äù  Another:  >>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like taking an expensive week-long vacation and then assuming you can spend an extra $1,000 per day forever since you are no longer staying at the Plaza.‚Äù  Another:  >>‚ÄúLast year, despite being deeply in debt, I bought a $100,000 sports car. So next year, buying another $100,000 car is not irresponsible because I am merely spending the same amount of money as the year before. And if I purchase ‚Äúonly‚Äù a $70,000 car, then I should be congratulated for reducing my annual spending by $30,000.‚Äù",progress18,2025-04-01T16:51:49,5

"So, i have terrible insomnia at times. There comes a point after 24hours or so, where time is lost almost. You kind of just don't care about sleeping, that is a terrible point to hit. because you don't care about the clock at the point or whether it is day or night. You kind of just don't want to sleep. You don't have to be on substances to stay awake like this, this is how i reset my sleep schedule, i divulge my self into reading various weird ass history wikipedia holes.  When you are passionate about doing something, those ideas you have while working on something you finish up at the end of the day, and think about what you were working on. Then it sinks in ""well what if i do this, what if remove that and change it, what about adding this"" mind runs wild into a second wind. It's hard to describe but i'm sure the majority of people have been at that point. whether or not it's a lyric from a song stuck in your head you refuse to google, because its there in your head but it's not coming up front yet.  edit- to add, you'd be surprised about how much your body will shut down after a being awake to long.
