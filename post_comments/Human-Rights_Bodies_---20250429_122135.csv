"At *RealClearPolitics*, [Peter Berkowitz](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/peter-berkowitz) makes the case that human rights are an idea foundational to the United States, a fact that endures despite the ideological corruption and institutional drift of many international organizations ostensibly dedicated to advancing human rights. As Berkowitz argues, ""By safeguarding human rights’ good name against those who would turn them into a license to defame Israel and promote jihad against the Middle East’s only rights-protecting democracy, the United States vindicates the principles on which American freedom rests.""",HooverInstitution,2025-04-29T12:32:51,-1
