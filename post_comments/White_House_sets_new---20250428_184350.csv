"From the article:  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday that July 4 is the new deadline for lawmakers to pass President Trump’s ambitious tax agenda.   Bessent and Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, met on Capitol Hill Monday with Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) and top tax writers.  Congress returned to Washington on Monday to kick off a key stretch to get the package, which includes broad swaths of Trump’s agenda, passed. Republicans aim to pass it with only GOP votes but must first work out significant disagreements.  Bessent on Monday hailed the unity among all factions before laying out the new target date.  “The House is moving things along quickly, and the Senate is in lockstep. We think that they are in substantial agreement,” Bessent said. “We hope we can have this tax portion done by the Fourth of July.”  Talk about fucking ironic",kootles10,2025-04-28T18:44:11,3
Is that still part of Day 1?  Trump has no momentum.,ranchoparksteve,2025-04-28T19:10:02,3
"They have to do it by that time anyway, because of the debt ceiling. That day is specifically picked not only because of independence day, but also Trump is using the brinkmanship tactics again to push for his agenda. You see, Trump is totally fine with US going default, cause GOP would be the one to blame and Trump always can be untouched.",nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-04-28T19:35:57,3

"I totally trust the GOP on these earthly matters and know that diminutive, but mighty in God man, Mike Johnson has prayed on this with his roommates, the megachurch pastor and his wife.  All 3 live in a Capitol Hill townhome that is owned by a Republican donor ""car magnate"".  It's not weird.  It's about God and Country, not the creepy vibes I got from seeing a selfie they took together.",Accurate-Guava-3337,2025-04-28T19:25:00,2

"I'm sure that he thinks the nation going into default is the same as when he bankrupted his businesses - he got to keep his personal wealth, but all the debt for that company went away.

This account was created in same time period that several other accounts were created.  They all share commonality of weird messages that seem poorly written by AI.

"You're not wishing for the collapse of the United states, you're just declaring your hatred for your home. You're using this country's past to justify your self-debilitating feelings and wishes. You don't know what you're asking for, you don't know how good you've had it. Yeah, this country may fall because of 1/3 of the population actively participating in its downfall, but know that you'll be apart of that number too.   The US isn't supposed to just be a country, it's a set of ideals that we, as humans, should strive to adhere to, dreams and beliefs that we work towards achieving.   What we are going through now goes against those ideals in what is possibly the worst way, so I get your frustration, yet, I will also acknowledge how, you're not only being blinded by it, but also effectively calling for suicide - if you still live in this country, because a nation like this, a country this big and powerful, collapsing like how the Roman empire did (except, if the Roman empire was at its peak), would prove disastrous for us ALL.   And to appeal to you and others' more cynical sides, but also to make you better understand what this means, this country has the strongest military in the world and is home to 370M people. What do you think will happen to all those weapons and people if the country collapses? You ever stopped and wonder where our nukes would go if the USA killed itself by people dumber yet more malicious than the ones in charge of the USSR by its last year?   You and others like you seriously don't know what you're asking for.",Leading-End4288,2025-04-28T19:47:20,-19

It’s not cute, it’s not edgy and to your point those who believe this sincerely have never known suffering.  They are no different to me than Trump and his cult who seek to destroy the US.",RizzardOfOz76,2025-04-29T05:49:30,1
I said all of that and you still don't realize what you're asking for is suicide.,Leading-End4288,2025-04-28T22:52:21,1
