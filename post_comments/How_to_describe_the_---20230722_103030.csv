"The first one:  > “Politician A beat them by 20%”.  If you say the second one (Politician A won by 10%), most people would think that means they won 55% to 45% (or two numbers with 10 between them).",ProLifePanda,2023-07-25T08:43:49,1
The easiest is Pol A beat Pol B 60-40.  Pol A beat Pol B by 20 POINTS not percent. Big difference.  And no need to go into how many points above 50%+1 a person won. (In a two person race.),DEKubiske,2023-07-25T11:37:30,1
"You would commonly say that politician A won by ""20 points"" to remove ambiguity about what you might mean by percentages of what number...",gcomeau2013,2023-07-25T13:57:16,1
"Won by 20% contains no ambiguity-- won by 10% might be technically accurate, but it is ambiguous as to whether you are referring to the margin between the candidates or the margin to 50% (although it should technically be 51%). Most people would probably incorrectly assume you meant the first. Also, if you wanted to reference their distance to 50%, you could just *say* that they got 60% of the vote.",[deleted],2023-07-29T19:17:23,1
