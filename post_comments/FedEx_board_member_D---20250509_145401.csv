"Trump red rural poor areas lost their hospitals.  They are letting their public schools be destroyed,  And now they will lose postal coverage.  FEMA is next.   It is sad, really. But I guess itâ€™s what they want.    Who are we to stop them?",WithMaliceTowardFew,2025-05-09T15:56:03,6

"Very no.  Note how it doesn't say FORMER FED EX board member. He's very much still on that board. It's very much a huge conflict of interest.  Additionally, this is potentially another step towards privatizing USPS, or eliminating it altogether.",StevenMC19,2025-05-09T15:01:03,11

"That is the crazy part. I live in Chicago and I was a big advocate for policies that help the small rural communities in the rest of the state, but when these people won't even stand up for themselves, I see no reason to stand up for them.  I didn't really care that they just take tax dollars and hate Chicago with a passion, or even their policy proposals to remove Chicago from the state. I try to treat others how I want to be treated. It does really bother me how little they care about their own communities though.  It's like we're on a speed run to absolutely decimate every small town in america.",The_Navy_Sox,2025-05-09T15:59:51,6
"Which is what Congress has been planning on since 2004.  Remember when they made USPS fund the entire federal pension program for years and the Dems only complained and never did anything when they had the chance  Remember when the Dems did absolutely nothing during Biden's term saying ""oh we can't do anything"" yet somehow Trump is firing people who apparently were ""unfireable""  USPS is a big cost on the government.  Destroying it means less taxes on the rich liberals and rich conservatives.   But don't blame the dems because they are pro transgender so that excuses everything they never fix.",giabollc,2025-05-09T15:14:18,-5
I sincerely didn't know.  FedEx is profitable and run well so I assumed it would transition learnings over.  Yeah Huge COI.,shivaswrath,2025-05-09T15:05:38,-5
Illinois without Chicago would just be Indiana.,WithMaliceTowardFew,2025-05-09T16:24:11,6
">USPS is a big cost on the government.  Literally every government-run program is. The military is a big cost on the government. The FBI is a big cost on the government. NASA is a big cost on the government. etc. They're services to the people in a properly functioning society. They're not there to make a profit.  And the retirement policy that damn-near crippled the USPS in 2004, Bush was in office and the Republicans held majority in the Senate (51-48 before election and 55-44 after) and House (229-205 before, and 232-202 after). It's no surprise they would look at the USPS as a failing business and not the civil service it really is.",StevenMC19,2025-05-09T15:20:40,7

"It's profitable and well-run...yes.  But honestly, tell me how much you use FedEx. How often are you utilizing their parcel and mail services? Now, tell me how much you use USPS. Why AREN'T you using FedEx as much as USPS?  Now, once you've seriously thought those questions out, ask yourself, ""would I prefer continuing to use USPS as it is as my primary mail service, or FedEx as it currently is?""",StevenMC19,2025-05-09T15:09:34,5
Fed Ex sucks. They also treats employees like shit. I hate when they are my carrier.,WithMaliceTowardFew,2025-05-09T15:53:10,4
"Ok, so I came across this post right after my daily drop at my local PO. I ship out around 30-50 packages a week for my hobby business and Fed Ex has *always* been way higher than USPS or UPS...until this week. Suddenly, Fed Ex is cheaper than both, as well as showing faster delivery dates. Not on everything, but at least half of them.  Well, I guess this explains that. ðŸ˜¬",WifeofBathSalts,2025-05-09T17:31:10,2
