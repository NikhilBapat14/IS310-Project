The message: fraud is ok for Trump and friends.,SyllabubTricky6684,2025-04-24T15:14:46,38
Gross to see Fiore pardoned. Reinforces that MAGA is just the culmination of a scam culture allowed to run rampant that preys on people and avoids accountability. Odds are she’ll commit more crimes and land back before a judge in the future.,tonyt4nv,2025-04-24T15:14:50,23
"Listen....Just because she stole money from public memorials and spent it on herself for purely personal and luxury items doesn't necessarily mean she is a self centered, egotistical, narcissistic and grossly tone deaf human. Her being MAGA says that.",dblan9,2025-04-24T15:21:24,22
"A pardon under Trump 1 cost $2million, which Trump and Giuliani would split. I wonder if the price has gone up with inflation or tariffs?",Ouibeaux,2025-04-24T15:19:26,10
"This is going to be interesting when the governor comments about it. He is a Republican who has to have Trump’s backing. On the other hand, he testified during her trial.  I’m hoping the media holds his feet to the fire until he responds.",RamonaQ-JunieB,2025-04-24T15:28:32,8
"""Clearing?""  Pardon's do not remove the guilty verdict. It only removes the punishment. The conviction will never leave her record.   > convicted last year of using donations intended for a fallen officer’s memorial, for personal use  This is who Donald and Republicans champion and support. People that steal from charities meant for honoring a police officer that died.   ...   Let that sink in.",socokid,2025-04-24T15:49:33,7

She admits guilt by accepting the pardon. How do they intend to make her a judge again?,addled_and_old,2025-04-24T15:53:00,6
so a person who scams and frauds gets pardoned by a businessman. what a surprise,saiyanscaris,2025-04-24T16:41:41,3
"Nevada State Attorney General Aaron Ford should file state charges against her. This woman took donations for a police officer gunned down in the line of duty and spent it on rent and plastic surgery.  The story explains why Trump committed this grave injustice:  ""Trump named Sigal Chattah as the Interim U.S. Attorney for Nevada, which is the state’s top federal law enforcement officer, whose office is in charge of trying cases such as Fiore’s. Chattah, who also serves as the state’s Republican National Committeewoman, is friends with Fiore.""",rapidcreek409,2025-04-24T16:57:37,4

One fraud pardoning another.  Sounds perfectly normal.,tjk45268,2025-04-24T16:04:42,2
It really sounds like Trump is the Law and Order president.,Troubled202,2025-04-24T16:16:50,2
"Is there any realistic argument that Fiore didn't do that embezzlement ?    The Alyn Beck memorial statute and park are a real thing that actually got done.  Fiore just allegedly purloined a few thousand bucks from the non-profit accounts, and was convicted by a Federal jury.  Her political history really is jaw-dropping.   You don't have to be a lawyer, or a college graduate, to be a City Council member, or mayor pro-tem, or even a Justice of the Peace.    But being appointed to be a JP after telling the commissioners that you'd probably win a gunfight inside the courtroom is really .... very rural.",Aghast_Cornichon,2025-04-24T18:09:36,2
