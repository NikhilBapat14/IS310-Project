If you are talking US politics then start at U.S. Government Accountability Office.[https://www.gao.gov/](https://www.gao.gov/) and Congressional Budget Office: [https://www.cbo.gov/](https://www.cbo.gov/),dcduck,2022-11-29T22:12:54,9
"This is ideally what the media is for.  Sadly, it does not do this.  CNN runs dozens of segments on the Green New Deal, but only in a “What does this mean for progressives versus moderates?  What does this mean for Democrats versus Republicans?” framing.",[deleted],2022-11-30T12:19:09,2
"There's not really an objective way to do this. ""Clean"" is a relative term. If a river was horribly polluted, and now it's 20% less polluted, but still 80% polluted, is that success or failure? Depends who you ask. Even if a bill is 100% successful, in that it cleans all the pollutants noticed and named in the bill, it may still be missing something. For example, there was a time plastic was celebrated as a way to use LESS paper and therefore be MORE environmentally friendly...and now that just seems laughably stupid. And how far back are we looking? Should we do a retrospective in 5 years, or 10 years, or 15 years? Our energy grid infrastructure has been much talked about as failing now, 60 years or more since it was built. Should we look back 60 years on policies? The Colorado River water allocation laws were made in the 1800s. How do we know when is the ""definitive"" look on how successful a policy was?  Answering the questions you're trying to answer requires an argument. It requires someone taking up a question in as much depth as is sufficient to answer the question, with as much time past as is relevant, repeated as many times as is necessary. This cannot be something we do in a systematic, objective fashion. The good news is, this is exactly what books are really good at, and there are plenty of authors that do take deep dives into policy issues like this.  High-quality newspapers are also good at doing this, though obviously you're subject to the topics they want to discuss. But for example, NYT ran an article a couple months ago about the huge progress the US has made in the last few decades regarding child poverty, and then discussed the reasons for those results. It was a fantastic article, but if you don't really care that much about the issue of child poverty, then you're still stuck waiting for whatever you do want to look at.",mormagils,2022-11-30T08:55:46,1
"This is along the lines, but these are both forward looking. I want to look backwards.  That Federal bill that was supposed to improve education. Did it? That State bill that was supposed to improve traffic. Did it?",gomi-panda,2022-11-29T22:50:37,5
" Thank you for articulating your thoughts believe there is a way to get by this sort of in the way the CBO tracks projected impact. What I'm considering is an arm of government that reports on impact rather than projected impact.  To your caution that there's a great deal of subjectivity involved, what I'm daydreaming about would limit the subjectivity. Every bill already includes an impact statement with measurable targets. It is these that can be assessed.",gomi-panda,2022-11-30T14:17:08,1
Some GAO reports are retrospective and usually look at the impact of programs and grants (which afaik are appropriated through budget bills). Here’s an example: https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-105616,Butiamnotausername,2022-11-30T04:55:23,7
"I mean, sure, but the reports would be almost meaningless if they ONLY measured how bills performed compared to projections and didn't account for additional side effects that occurred, and that requires subjectivity. You're basically just asking for the government to have a campaign propaganda arm.",mormagils,2022-11-30T14:30:03,1
"I understand better what you are saying and see the issues with this. So it seems administratively something like this would need the same level of independence that I presume the GAO or CBO has, in order to minimize political interference with reporting. It would further require a matrix impact assessment model in order to limit subjectivity and develop some uniformity.   Anyway, I think government by the people would be better served with this sort of institution.",gomi-panda,2022-11-30T16:39:24,1
"We do have this feature, just not coming from the government itself, and that's good. This is what media, academia, political authors, watchdog organizations, talk shows, etc are for. A government run by alternating parties cannot possibly ever be objectively enough to be successful.",mormagils,2022-11-30T19:37:43,1
"The CBO and GAO are supposed to be nonpartisan. In practice is that true? I would think that could be an effective use of government, along with civil society organizations.",gomi-panda,2022-11-30T20:10:19,1
"Yeah, so they *are* nonpartisan, but the very concept of defining a scope of how to analyze the success of past legislation is an inherently political question. They can't continue to claim true objective nonpartisanship if they start trying to make judgement calls about how to answer this kind of question.",mormagils,2022-12-01T08:32:00,1
