Are any of these trade deals here in the room with us now?,Unhappy_Gazelle392,2025-05-09T08:10:52,20
Trump has backed himself into a corner and it reminds me of the following:  “When you want a deal real bad you get a real bad deal” T. Boone Pickens,TubeframeMR2,2025-05-09T08:14:21,13

"He must get some endorphin hit from the mere act of making a deal good or bad.

Trump looks worse with every passing day. Cognitive decline along with serious illness?,Purple_Pieman01,2025-05-09T08:25:51,2
I remember this one episode of 30 Rock where Tracy wanted to go to space so they faked it because he would not take no for an answer. I can see Trump's cabinet faking these phone calls so he can feel like he's doing something.,Scrooge-McShillbucks,2025-05-09T08:47:16,2
This guy has more flip-flops than the beach on a summer afternoon. How are investors and businesses supposed to deal with crap like this? I haven't seen this many imbeciles in charge of a country since I last saw an episode of the Three Stooges.,jarchack,2025-05-09T09:06:21,2
He’s begging for deals.  I do feel better that Rolls Royce cars are exempt from tariffs.  Gettin my order ready!,sullyball008,2025-05-09T09:31:13,2
Trump negotiating with himself and losing,OptimalAd3007,2025-05-09T10:51:23,2
"The whole ""we are doing this to bring jobs back to the USA"" excuse has gone the way of the ""we are doing this bc of fentanyl"" tariffs excuse.  He's clueless.",pinetreesgreen,2025-05-09T11:02:50,2

"can't help but just enjoy the chaos at this point  even the highly touted UK deal wasn't anything real yet. there are no deals. this is pure, naked market manipulation, and its fun watching it work so well.",bryan-healey,2025-05-09T08:21:37,1
"wow, on top of the 200 he's already made?  I'm always amazed at MAGA's ability to believe his very clearly, obviously, in your face lying.",uhohnotafarteither,2025-05-09T08:47:31,1

Facts.  Trump let his narcissistic traits go wild and expected everyone to cower in fear and lift him up on his throne.  Instead what he has received is pain for the rest of us and worldwide hate.  ,arilupe,2025-05-09T08:57:54,5
What about the deal he made with Qatar last week? That's probably a real one.,duke_chute,2025-05-09T08:22:31,2

If it was real he would show us the text. They would be beyond eager to show everybody just how good of the deal they got.   So it's either not real or it is so bad in its terms that they don't want to show anyone.,Valuable_Sea_4709,2025-05-09T09:21:17,2
"This is the [Qatar Deal](https://apnews.com/article/trump-qatar-deal-conflicts-saudi-arabia-emoluments-7379bee2e307d39bd43b534a05ae3207) that I'm talking about,  pretty sure it's real. . .",duke_chute,2025-05-09T09:24:34,1
