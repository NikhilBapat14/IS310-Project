There are decaffeination plants there (and in Mexico), but last guidance I saw was that CBP would still consider the original country of origin for tariffs.

"Oh I know.  Even though I identify with neither left nor right, I do hate hypocrisy.  Most Republicans pretend to care about fiscal responsibility, but only when they are out of power.  As soon as they gain power they spend money they don't have like proverbial drunken sailors (no offense intended to drunks or sailors).",duzies,2025-05-09T10:45:45,3
"Stick to your original point, which focused on which president printed money. Both presidents literally did to deal with an unprecedented global event. This is facts. If you have an aversion with “both sides” …well I guess don’t open a history book, you might find more upsetting facts about your “team”.  Now the merits of the stimulus packages…..a lot of money was printed to deal with an unprecedented event. Under Trump, money was sent directly to citizens through checks, rental assistance programs were created to pay off unpaid rent and utility bills, vaccines were developed to address COVID, business loan programs were set up to prevent business loss, student loan payments were paused, etc.  And Biden continued most of these actions, albeit with a focus on distribution of the COVID vaccine and infrastructure building.   As we went deeper into the Biden years, there was clearly an issue of inflation, particularly around late 2022 ( mortgage rates starting going up, cost of living jumped, gas prices rose). And it didn’t help that we went full steam ahead to business as usual, and got invoked in war-mongering in Ukraine and Gaza.  When your president, and it happens under your watch…and you literally continue the money printing of the last administration….its clear Biden played a role  in causing inflation.  Like I said…if you’re a partisan, you must have a difficult time rectifying history. The sad part is that I even said things under Trump are much worse than under Biden economy wise. But I guess if I slighted your blue team, I must have offended you enough that now you’re just twisting facts.",pillbox_purgatory,2025-05-10T02:52:24,0

"So here’s the thing bud. You are as partisan as I am but masquerade yourself as a snooty “independent” because you criticize democrats. I can criticize democrats as well. You were the one who started being partisan when you called it Bidenflation. Obviously there were 3 major spending bills during Covid and Biden was responsible for 1. You could have called it COVIDflation if you wanted to be bipartisan, but you’re not, so you didn’t.
