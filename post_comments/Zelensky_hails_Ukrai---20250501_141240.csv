The good news for Ukraine: Donald Trump has never won a negotiation.   The bad news for Ukraine: Donald Trump has never lived up to a deal.,Just_the_nicest_guy,2025-05-01T14:16:09,18
"Serious question, why didn’t this topic get more traction here? I feel this is significant after supporting Ukraine and getting a good deal?",TheModes,2025-05-01T22:24:03,3
"Trump is so desperate for ""deals"" now that he caved on everything.   The US can't even hope to get anything out of the deal for at least ten years.  Ukraine got everything it wanted   Why did lil' Trumpy cave? Trump has been bullshitting everyone about ""200 deals"" with other countries like he's a teenager bullshitting about a ""girlfriend"" in Canada.     It's just a matter of time before this lie gets exposed. Trump knows it and is frantically trying to get deals anywhere he can so his hands are not completely empty when he gets called out on the ""200 deals"" bullshit.",Beantown-Jack,2025-05-01T14:33:14,5
"As sure as Christmas Day follows Christmas Eve, Trump will renege on the deal and cheat Zelensky and the Ukrainians out of hundreds of billions of dollars.  What's more, most of that money will end up in Trump's bank account.",crazybones,2025-05-01T15:29:30,1
"I hate Trump, but I think he has just been played by Zelensky. If Russia attempts to interfere with this deal by increasing the severity of the war or refusing ceasefire, American commercial interests will be put at risk - not a good look for Trump.",opinionsareus,2025-05-01T14:28:01,5
Zelenskyy knows what's he doing right now.  He's stroking Trump's ego to keep him from running off to Daddy Putin the first second he gets.,ERedfieldh,2025-05-01T14:28:17,2
Trust a Trump deal as much as you trust a Putin ceasefire.,MrLurid,2025-05-01T14:23:23,1
"Makes me think Zelensky had very good timing, between what Russia did with its bombing the other day, Trump getting mad, and then Zelensky finding him at the pope's funeral. I think he took his chance to get Trump's ear when he didn't have any of his advisors around. Something like ""Hey Trump, Putin doesn't respect you and look at how he treats your offers of peace. How about we make that mineral deal and you can signal to Putin you're pissed off? This big beautiful deal will show him that you're a man who gets things done and aren't to be trifled with.""  Now Trump can claim all the equipment going to Ukraine isn't free because the deal pays for it in mineral rights, meanwhile Ukraine just needs to outlast this administration.",Orzorn,2025-05-01T15:27:37,1
"Played how?  \- Pre ""deal""; USA would be sending armaments and money at tax payer cost.  \- OR pre ""deal""; USA would just stop supporting Ukr.  The world hates USA (which they seem to do either way).  \- With the ""deal""; USA has some extra benefit for UKR to regain their borders.      The deal is not strong for the US, but it also does not require US to provide any protection.",johnnybayarea,2025-05-02T01:24:14,1
 What are you even on...as if Democrats don't like money as well?  You think if a dem president came into power they would undo this deal?  They would also take the minerals and the decoupling from China minerals and call it a W for themselves.,johnnybayarea,2025-05-02T01:30:32,1
"If Trump stops supporting Ukraine, he will be hurting the commercial enterprises in the US that are counting on mineral extraction.",opinionsareus,2025-05-02T13:48:45,1
"That's not getting played, that's exactly what ""we"" wanted.  Depends on what camp you are in.  If you were of the mindset that protecting UKR (or defeating RUS) is an American ideal and something we must do, getting some financial guarantees on the backend (however small) is better than nothing.     If you are of the mindset that USA should not protect UKR as they are not allies, then sure we're getting roped into the conflict for some minerals we may never even get.  In that case, we should abandon UKR (or give minimally cause every day/month/year this drags on it only stands to hurt RUS) and they invest more heavily in other poor less conflict countries that also have minerals.",johnnybayarea,2025-05-02T14:06:47,1
