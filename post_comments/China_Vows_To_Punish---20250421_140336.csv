Welcome to the Faustian bargain of getting everything from China,woailyx,2025-04-21T14:12:51,221
"For decades, people thought opening up China to the West was one of Nixon's biggest accomplishments. Funny how more than 30 years after his death, it's pretty widely regarded as a bad move.¬†",nowaygreg,2025-04-21T14:21:20,205

"""China, however, continues to push back against the Trump administration‚Äôs tariffs, vowing to fight the trade war against the United States ‚Äúto the end.‚Äù  They're a manufacturing nation and we're a buying nation. They won't like ""to the end"" very much.",LatterShake6728,2025-04-21T17:30:23,28
"For a country that swears that the US will be hurt much more than they will be by the trade war, they sure seem pretty scared right now.   I thought they didn‚Äôt need us, they‚Äôve been here for ‚Äú5,000 years‚Äù etc..",detestableDan,2025-04-21T15:24:29,13
Wow they really are scared.,Unlucky_Buyer_2707,2025-04-21T17:06:25,18
Are they planning on sending them more cheaply made crap that will break in about a week.,force4good390,2025-04-21T15:41:09,2
It‚Äôs a lot easier to find a new supplier for cheap shit than it is to find a replacement for American consumer spending.   This is a paper tiger lashing out - a sign of weakness and not strength.,SlartibartfastMcGee,2025-04-21T15:35:03,7
"Where are the ""Trump will stop the wars"" people when we entered this trade war?",TooMuchButtHair,2025-04-21T15:02:16,-18
That's a good plan. I think Trump made mistakes on his tariffs. I wanted to see Europe targeted first. They're the more importantly unfair trade partners. China should have been the big bad end goal after getting through tariffs with everyone else. They're one of the only countries that tariffs would have an impact on most consumers.,kaytin911,2025-04-21T15:48:49,-5
"If we go back to pushing 80% tariffs, I don't think China will have to worry about that.",cathbadh,2025-04-21T19:52:11,-2
"I've been avoiding buying China-made products for years now. Do I still end up getting them? Yes, but I absolutely try to support other countries OR the US if possible.",LordRattyWatty,2025-04-21T14:19:23,97
"Here's the other wrinkle for the EU to think about, in terms of a ""Faustian Bargain""    Trump is absolutely committed to stopping the fentanyl crisis in America. It means the Mexican drug cartels are going to be hit hard. What is the CCP going to do with all that precursor material that formerly went to Mexico to be processed into fentanyl to be pumped into the United States?   The EU, if they cut a deal with China, will see mass dumping of Chinese goods into those countries, and probably along with a ton of fentanyl too.   That's the real problem, China will punish these countries anyway. It's only a question of when, not if, and I think the CCP's brand of being ruthless beyond measure will finally catch up to them.",TheLaughingRhino,2025-04-22T01:50:12,10
"At the time everyone thought it would Westernize China and they would eventually drop communism and authoritarianism. Clearly that way of thinking has proven to be false.   Still not a bad move to use the Sino Soviet split against the Russians, but yeah, it's had a lot more negatives since the end of the Cold War and China not changing their ways.",War-Damn-America,2025-04-21T14:43:36,94
"it was a great accomplishment.  But then in the 90s, we should have started moving to isolate the last strong bastion of communism.  But since they started liberalizing their market, we were like ""see we're winning.""  What they didn't realize was they just pivoted to something akin to fascism and liberalization.  When the Chicoms did nothing to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons to their little puppet in North Korea, that was when we should have hit the breaks.  The second big red flag was when they started militarizing the South China Sea.",ObadiahtheSlim,2025-04-21T15:05:55,29
Nixon was bad all over for foreign policy.,kaytin911,2025-04-21T15:50:32,5
"I'm with you on this. Everyone always counts out the USA, especially like how they said the USSR was overtaking the US at one point, or Japan was going to demolish the US in the 90s and beyond.   There will always be very nosy people in the US who want to stick their noses in everybody's affairs and talk down the nation, because they love a weak US, and they hate us when we're strong.   But the US will always come out on top. China knows this which is why they're being so vocal. It's what communists do when they're panicking.",AldrichOfAlbion,2025-04-22T07:03:47,1
I have a feeling you‚Äôre being serious and that‚Äôs a little worrying lol,MiceTonerAccount,2025-04-21T16:52:56,24
"Mate, you're comparing an apple to a freaking ribeye steak.",TheThunderOfYourLife,2025-04-21T16:49:18,20
China would become an antagonist even if they became a democracy. They are just too big of a country to not want an independent policy.,dankhorse25,2025-04-22T02:54:00,11
And Biden recently undid all of that and pushed the Russians and Chinese into a close partnership. He was one of the worst presidents of all time.,kaytin911,2025-04-21T15:51:23,30
"Yes and no, they would certainly be a rival if they weren't communist, but I don't think they would be antagonistic in the same way. We wouldn't be focused on the potential for war with them if say the ROC had won the Chinese Civil War and the communists were on Taiwan.",War-Damn-America,2025-04-29T08:42:21,1
