"Maybe I'm alone in this, but I can't make sense of this. I thought at first this was an event for May Day, but it's not, right? It it 24 hours a day, every day, starting on May Day. Am I right about that? Love the idea, but it's confusing design... although very attractive, and awesome.",MarkMaynardDotcom,2025-04-18T14:04:55,1
"Bring along family and friends. Let’s show up large to defend our constitution, the rule of law & our federal agencies. Lady Liberty is counting on us",Lumpy-Platypus4653,2025-04-30T00:17:43,1
Umm…not one single day dedicated to women’s rights or reproductive rights? Not one?? That’s…interesting.  I’m guessing this is run by all men 😒,streetNereid,2025-04-17T17:27:41,-12
May the 4th be with you. I’m guessing a star wars resistance theme costume party? What are we even doing?,No_hero_here,2025-04-18T02:48:15,2
"Correct. It happens to coincide with MAY DAY, but the event is being coordinated by a coast guard vet. MAYDAY as in we are in an emergency.",justokcheesesteak,2025-04-19T20:19:14,1
"Illinois Gov Pritzker urged Democrats to stop listening to ""do-nothing political types"" who are calling for caution at a time when Americans are demanding urgent action, and to ""fight-EVERYWHERE AND ALL AT ONCE.""",Lumpy-Platypus4653,2025-04-30T00:18:38,1
"I believe it's lumped in with ""Gender & LGBTQIA+""",quesigirl,2025-04-17T18:29:15,10
That’s ridiculous. Four months worth of dedicated “theme” days and they couldn’t think to put in ONE day for womens/repro? Just gonna lump it in around the edges of other things?  Major side-eye and skepticism from me. This is a very bad look.,streetNereid,2025-04-17T18:55:36,-4
Hey - THey are coming out with an updated theme schedule. Also - the main goal is impeachment and conviction and removal of Trump. That is the singular goal. The themes are secondary support for the main goal. Don't overthink it.,justokcheesesteak,2025-04-19T20:18:04,1
"“Don’t you worry your pretty little head about the details, just show up and do what I want.”  Seriously no. It’s too late. It’s literally insane that it was left out from the start. Again, seems clear this is run by a bunch of men.",streetNereid,2025-04-20T06:13:43,0
"Jesus, do you blow everything in your life completely out of proportion?  Edit:  Lol wow… poses a completely disproportionate straw man—equating not specifically having a day dedicated to women, while having gender and LGBTQ+ issue days, to downplaying the risk to Roe v. Wade—and then blocks me so I can’t respond?  Get help, nutso.",YurtMcnurty,2025-04-20T23:57:55,0
You mean like when we worried about Roe v Wade being overturned? That kind of blowing out of proportion?,streetNereid,2025-04-21T20:22:58,1
