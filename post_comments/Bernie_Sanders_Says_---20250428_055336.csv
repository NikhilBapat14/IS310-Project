"From the piece:  >“We are living ... in the richest country in the history of the world and yet you have one person, Mr. Musk, who owns more wealth than the bottom 53% of American households,” Sanders said. “That is insane. That is oligarchy on steroids.”",zsreport,2025-04-28T05:54:13,86
"I’m in Japan for two weeks and I’ve been so impressed with how easy it was to get around from Tokyo, Hakone, and Kamakura purely through public transportation.  There’s vending machines and convenience stores every block or so if I need a drink or snack.  The trains and busses are decently clean considering how often they’re used.   Im from the Bay Area, one of the wealthier parts of the US and it feels like our infrastructure is stuck in the early 2000s.  Really makes you wonder what are we even paying all these taxes for.",asayys,2025-04-28T06:01:37,67

"I like Bernie, but he's actually wrong. A true oligarchy, the direction we are heading, is so much worse.   A two tiered justice system, billionaires kid murders another family by driving drunk... 2 months probation.   All public goods and luxuries will be reserved for the oligarchs. Your favorite artists no longer do concerts for the public cuz the billionaires can just pay more for private parties. Beaches, national parks, divvied off to the rich. Everything remaining is now even more overcrowded.",ares21,2025-04-28T15:55:34,1

"I couldn’t help but laugh. If you go to northern Maine there’s parts of it that are stuck in the *1950s!* It’s so painfully obvious that we stopped investing in this country, the rich funneled all the money to the top and it’s gotten to the point that you can point to just about any part of society and see the depreciation. It’s amazing how developed and underdeveloped this country is at the same time",Vel0clty,2025-04-28T08:22:03,29

"Yup also from the Bay. Wife and I did a Europe trip (Amsterdam, Paris, Interlaken, Venice, Munich, Prague, Berlin) and we never used a car, everything was public transit or walking. Not only were the services easy to navigate and affordable but they were reliable and well kept and never felt dangerous (unlike BART).    The Bay always seems 20 years to late when it comes to highway infrastructure let alone public transit.",therapistofcats,2025-04-28T06:31:41,7

"Candidates running against each other is the definition of a primary. I don’t hear you dragging the other candidates from that primary, and, should you recall correctly, Hillary received Bernie’s endorsement and the vast majority of Bernie voters cast theirs for Hillary in the primary.

"Paying for a service doesn't make you an oligarch. Paying to win elections does. How the fuck is flying first class with your own money helping her influence an election? Goddammit it's so infuriating that working class people such as yourself can't grasp the fact that parties don't matter anymore. It's what class you belong to. And if your not one of the richest people in the world, your part of the same class as everyone else, the working class. So stop sucking rich people dick, and start acting your wage and show some class solidarity.",MRBEEFnCHEDDR,2025-04-28T07:05:54,8

"The whole “fight oligarchy” shtick reeks of controlled opposition to me… where were AOC and Bernie during the last 4 years while all these major capitalists expanded their wealth to obscene levels? They were making milquetoast statements and voting along with Nancy Pelosi, defending Israel and justifying the U.S. military industrial complex.  It’s not “fight oligarchy” it’s “end the dictatorship of the bourgeoise”. Bernie and AOC feel like they’re just there to siphon progressives back into the fold (ie vote dem). I’ve lost all faith in them. Their voting record during the Biden administration was the nail in the coffin for me. I guess all this theatre just feels like they’re welding the coffin shut lol",SSR_Id_prefer_not_to,2025-04-28T12:50:37,1
"And God forbid we try to build anything in maine.  Every time the idea comes up to build a new road, or add more commuter rail between Portland and central Maine, or add more housing, people start screeching about their land being taken over by the state, liberals costing the state money, and ruining their third or fourth vacation homes view.  ",Ok-Focus-5362,2025-04-28T10:33:18,9

"Notice what else was going on during those years? The cold war. The oligarchs, aka the capitalists, made some concessions to the working class because of they were threatened by a communist revolution. They had to sell capitalism, a system that had led to two world wars, and the exploitation of most people on earth against a system that despite it's flaws was lifting millions out of poverty. They had to prove that they weren't just as racists as the recently defeated Nazis so they allowed some concessions for civil rights.  However once the Soviet Union collapsed and China liberalized, the oligarchs were suddenly safe from the working class revolt, so they took back the concessions they had made during the cold war.",DEEP_SEA_MAX,2025-04-28T16:18:47,2

"Lifelong resident, NIMBYism also known as “not in my backyard” has a chokehold on the state for sure. People are so quick to complain about the lack of anything in their town but are also the same people that refuse to let any new developments happen.  I was looking at google maps of the northern border recently out of general curiosity and was astounded at what the US/Canadian boarder looks like. On one side is beautifully designed neighborhoods, towns, urban development, then right across the boarder, same climate, same resources, and it’s just fuckin acres of forest. Blew my mind how left behind we are up here. But in a way that’s sort of what makes Maine so special. It’s one of the last “great frontiers untouched by man”.",Vel0clty,2025-04-28T11:03:42,3
