Who to believe? The country that literally has no reason to lie or the administration that can't seem to tell the truth to save its life....ðŸ¤”,Crazy-Nights,2025-04-28T14:26:59,6
Seattle Harbor is empty of all cargo ships. Go to r/pics.  Apparently China has stopped all Cargo ships.  Get ready for empty shelves.,morbob,2025-04-28T14:13:13,6
Bullshitter caught bullshitting. More bullshit at 11.Â ,overfiend1976,2025-04-28T14:14:25,4
If they were having talks and outwardly denying them it wouldn't be hard to play the tapes to show the world. What's that? The tapes are where? On hunters laptop? Darn sleepy Joe!,Sir_Ruje,2025-04-28T14:12:40,3
Trump is negotiating the China tariff with Russiaâ€¦perhaps.,ranchoparksteve,2025-04-28T14:08:51,7

"Trump is hallucinating.   Ok republicans, when are you going to step up, here?",keyjan,2025-04-28T14:22:14,3
"Amazing that the choice of whether to believe Trumpâ€™s administration or [x] on a simple point of fact, the answer would always be [x] *even if* [x] is China.",AINonsense,2025-04-28T14:13:00,2

"There will not be any other trade deals until the China deal is signed first. If you were India, would sign a deal with possibility of China holding out for a better deal?",TomatoesB4Potatoes,2025-04-28T20:59:44,1
"Why don't the White House just release the tapes of these conversations? Surely they are recorded. This way, we can expose the Chinese for being lying POS.",xibeno9261,2025-04-28T17:45:04,0

I think China holds so many of the cards (to use his terms) that he wont get to talk to Xi at this point. He might get the new intern just to piss him off.,StrikingAnxiety5527,2025-04-28T14:21:52,5
"He had focused on china only, then he would have had allies , HAD to support his tariffs. Instead he declared himself king of stupid and alienated all potential allies. All, except Russia ffs.  This is the dumbest economic policy since Chairman Mao. The irony is both sad and hilarious.",oroechimaru,2025-04-28T23:11:40,2
