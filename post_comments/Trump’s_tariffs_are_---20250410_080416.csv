"such a classic headline.  ""heres how thats bad for democrats"" lol",BenMullen2,2025-04-10T08:14:18,84
"Articles like these annoy me.  If a thing is bad, it's bad.  Why should it matter so much who explains it.  If anyone's fumbling anything it's journalists, not politicians.  It's their job to report the truth.  But in the end citizens aren't children, they shouldn't need spoon feeding.  We're all trying so hard to make sure someone else has responsibility, rather than taking it on ourselves.  Like adults.",ziptasker,2025-04-10T09:47:07,37
How? The best we can do is elect more democrats but the midterms are a year away. History has proven all this is a bad idea and House and Senate will likely turn blue next time around.,LLFD1982,2025-04-10T08:09:40,15
Idk I've been seeing democrats raking Republicans over the coals over this in the house and senate. Seems like the media is intentionally misrepresenting this for some reason though,Dirk_McGirken,2025-04-10T11:39:49,7
"Stupid headline, stupid article. All this stuff is being done with executive orders and executive branch. Democrats don't control executive branch and they don't  control the legislative branch either.",homebrew_1,2025-04-10T11:14:39,10

of course they are. all they do is complain “we must not this and we must that!” we are living in air bud where the losing team keeps yelling DOGS CANT PLAT BASKETBALL! And the dog just keeps dunking on them and the points still count.,SuperModes,2025-04-10T12:54:20,2
"And Democrats should point out that Trump is about to pull a ""liberal"" trick by bailing out farmers:[https://sentientmedia.org/usda-signals-possible-relief-for-farmers/](https://sentientmedia.org/usda-signals-possible-relief-for-farmers/)   Not that it, by itself is wrong, but his tariffs are causing it, he's slashing the government assistance, his new budget pulls out the funding for Medicaid, but he's willing to spend government funds to help red states thank him. We should be out front on this one for sure",WearOk4875,2025-04-10T19:08:09,2

Democrats need to stop reacting to what Trump does and create their own messaging. They have been the anti-Trump party too long. They have no identity beyond that.,WeenFan4Life,2025-04-10T12:31:24,2
"No. They have to wait til unemployment spikes, then take advantage. Talking about what COULD happen sounds more like whining. Let Trump burn it down and then go hard.",Operation-FuturePuss,2025-04-10T09:36:34,1
"I mean, they have a point.  Too many Democrats are trying to both sides this issue instead of forcefully saying “tariffs are bad and the President is a dumb fuck.”  It’s all happening because too many Democrats are unwilling to accept that they’re the party of the educated middle class who mostly benefits from global trade and continue to bend over backwards for people who aren’t going to vote for them.",tc100292,2025-04-10T10:10:29,2

"It's hilarious how the Republicans have media that will die on the stupidest of hills to support their candidates claims, including Fox losing hundreds of millions of dollars in lawsuits, but the ""liberal media""  is just a stream of ""democrats cure cancer, how this is bad news for Democrats.""",Messyfingers,2025-04-10T09:41:02,40
The democrats are Charlie Brown and the media is Lucy holding the football. WTF.,G-Unit11111,2025-04-10T15:24:50,3
"I disagree. I do think people want to be spoon-fed. And I think people want dopamine hits. And the Democratic party is not doing a good job of either. Instead of having The Squad jump down from the sky ""choose your fighter"" style, how about having everyday Americans on telling us how much money they lost on the stock market. How they're going to have to put off retirement.  They have to make it easy and hit that emotional trigger.  ""I could have bought 5,000 cartons of eggs with the money I lost."" Democratic ideals appeal to people. We are losing because we're not effectively reaching people.  And we are so far behind the Republicans in messaging I don't know how we're ever going to catch up.  ",ThisisBetty04,2025-04-10T12:14:33,2
I'm not too confident about the senate in 2026. But the house is looking good.,Far-9947,2025-04-10T10:30:13,4
This is the right answer.  Because this insanity has not led to food or part shortages yet.  It has not created a recession/depression yet.    The best move right now is for the Democrats to bide their time and wait.  Never interfere with your enemy when he is making a mistake.,not_that_planet,2025-04-10T10:11:17,2
Can you let us know which Democrats are bothsiding this?,blueindsm,2025-04-10T11:56:22,3

"That’s the million dollar question. How do Democrats dumb down the messaging while still appearing competent?  The big difference between each side of the aisle is the constituency. On the right, they’re looking for something to hate and a way to say they won. If it pisses off the other side they’re good to go. On the left they want something to believe in, somebody to fight for them, AND they want to see results.  The GOP can promise to fuck shit up and deliver with the simple message of, “we will fuck shit up and liberals will be miserable.” No plan needed so no plan offered. All red voters want is an issue they can agree with and everything else can be forgiven.  Democrats want that detailed plan because we keep the receipts. Most Democrats don’t care about single topics with a great deal of them wanting all of their wants met by a candidate with no room for compromise.  It’s like ordering up a pizza for a group of people. One side wants sardines. The other side can’t decide between pepperoni, hamburger, or Canadian bacon and pineapple. While they’re all perfectly fine with pepperoni but they’re tired of just going with the group so they dig in and vote for their rando topping. The other side all votes sardines like they said they would and that’s what arrives. An extra large sardine pizza for everybody to eat because of principles or whatever.",PaulClarkLoadletter,2025-04-10T13:52:20,3

"The GOP has think tanks constantly doing customer surveys on people's hot buttons and what works ... like ""sleepy Joe"", abortion, Pizzagate, ""Democrats soft on crime"", etc. so, all their members are given instruction plus passed to Fox and they seem like a force to be recogned with while a minority have big portion of the media attention.  The Dems have hundreds of people with different plans and outlooks that seem confusing to the public.  So, would you rather be in a cult that helps people, loves diversity, values health and education or lose all of that because you are afraid of what people might think?",ncdad1,2025-04-10T13:54:08,2
