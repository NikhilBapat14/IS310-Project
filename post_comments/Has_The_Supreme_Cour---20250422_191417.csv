Alito and Thomas are scavenging for the sloppy seconds,steve_ample,2025-04-22T19:27:41,8
"If they're on the right side of history for the time being, even if it's due to self preservation and nothing else, I welcome it.  I sincerely do not like this court, but we need someone in power to *fucking do anything* to help us. Because Democrats can't (and won't anyways), ex-presidents have barely existed to denounce what's happening, and other countries.. well the US in basically untouchable for about 400 reasons, outside of economic policy that is a long term play and won't actually help because Trump is stupid, stubborn, and, ya know, doing this all on purpose anyways.",Spam_Hand,2025-04-22T19:16:59,11
"From reporter Paul Blumenthal:  Over the Easter weekend, the Supreme Court issued a remarkable order in the wee hours of Saturday morning blocking President Donald Trump from immediately removing a group of Venezuelan immigrants from a detention center in Texas and, potentially, sending them to a notorious prison in El Salvador.  The court’s intervention here is remarkable due to its speed, its rebuke of the administration and the court’s seeming belief it had to issue an order without even waiting for Justice Samuel Alito to write a dissent. That dissent, released later on Saturday and joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, nitpicked at procedural issues that Alito ultimately got wrong.

"Anyone who think this Supreme Court will save this country from fascism has not realized that we are already a fascist country and have been since the Nazi in chief was sworn in. We have already been disappearing people, arresting and holding US citizens with no due process, we are sending people to other fascist countries to be imprisoned indefinitely without due process. The president flauts judicial orders. Congress tacitly approves of all this. Oligarchs can purchase exemptions from tariffs. Universities are being defunded. The Department of Education was eradicated. The government is being gutted if any and all programs that help people. Legislation is in progress to take the vote from married women. Trump is removing legal assistance for any that oppose him. It’s still April people. This is all happening because the Heritage Foundation carefully laid the plans for it, and Trump is their useful idiot. We have been overtaken by religious zealots.",Perle1234,2025-04-22T19:41:06,4

"It's only ""on purpose"" until it's directly contradicted in the next impending moment. Like all the hullabaloo about him publicly and openly wanting to nix J.Powell until earlier today he claimed he has no intention of doing that saying something to the effect of ""Stop making stuff up liberal media!"".",its-a-baka,2025-04-22T19:52:41,2

"While I don’t disagree with everything you said, I don’t think America will stay a fascist country. Trump is incompetent, his admin is incompetent and already turning on each other. Big tech companies who supported him are slowly backing away because he has proven that while one day you may be in his graces and the best person he’s ever met the next day he will feed you to the lions if it suits his needs. While he has given off the facade of being confident in his tactics I think it’s the opposite. His policy is practically crumbling under neath his feet before he even signs the executive order. The bigger problem is the damage he has done after he’s no longer in office. It will take years if not decades to rebuild the infrastructure he has destroyed. Meanwhile countries will leave us in the dust. We will fall behind in technology, education, and population will continue to decline due to health and who wants to brith a child into poverty that most Americans are living currently or will be in the next few years. All empires fall, this is America’s version of the Roman Empire. It’s been a hell of a ride. I suggest you lay low and hopefully there’s something left on the other side when we get out of this tunnel. Smoke em if you got em and if you don’t smoke i may I suggest edibles. It may not solve the problem but you will feel a hell of a lot better while the ship sinks around us.",a_rabid_buffalo,2025-04-22T21:41:49,2

I’m lucky to be in Washington where said edibles are available lol.,Perle1234,2025-04-23T20:13:19,1

I’m torn between buying a house in MN vs WA. I’ve been considering it the past few years.,Perle1234,2025-04-23T20:34:04,1
I’m in the process of buying a house right now in MN. The sad truth is while there are many things MN gets right the cost of living is not one of them. While buying a house is still cheaper in the long run than renting an apartment right now it’s still somewhat of a nightmare compared to what you can get in other states. However those other states tend to be red leaning and MN is technically a purple state with a GOP base right now that has a one seat majority in the house (that tried to stage a coup by holding session and electing house representatives and trying to push through legislation that was deemed illegal by our Supreme Court) luckily I think Walz will get a third term and in 2026 we will lean heavily into blue again.,a_rabid_buffalo,2025-04-23T20:37:24,2
Housing is far higher in the Seattle area than in MN. This unrenovated 1970’s split foyer is $2.5M. It’s pretty prohibitive. In contrast I bought my house in Wyoming in 2017 for $350K at 1.7%. It’s so cheap I’ll probably never sell it lol. It’s worth $750 now.,Perle1234,2025-04-23T20:40:23,2
The place I’m buying has more than doubled in price in less than 3 years. I was able to secure the lowest interest rate the mortgage manager said they have seen in 15 years of 5.2%. My house is only 800 sq feet. To put in retrospect my apartment 7 years ago was 1300 sq feet at 1200 bucks a month. When I moved out 3 years ago it was 2000 a month.  But yeah if imagine in major cities it would be a nightmare as well.,a_rabid_buffalo,2025-04-23T20:43:25,1
The problem in Seattle is that there are so few small houses on the market. My Wyoming house is 4 br/3 ba. I think it’s about 4000 sq feet. I live alone with two cats lol. I got the big house so my dad could live in the basement but he got dementia and is in a care home. I just want a 2br but that’s hard to find. I’m going to come to MN later this year for work and look around again. You’re right about getting a move on it though. Prices will continue to rise in MN. And WA lol.,Perle1234,2025-04-23T20:47:46,2
