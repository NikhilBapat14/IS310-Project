"Throw presidents in there too. And make giving out insider info, or intentional market manipulation a basis for impeachment.",Constant-Kick6183,2025-04-11T11:45:34,14
"Some context:  >**Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene bought stocks hit hard by Trump tariffs during market meltdown**  >Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, an avid supporter of the Trump administration's trade policies, not only bought stocks last week as others dumped them in a panic — she scooped up some of the biggest losers.  >Lululemon, Dell Computer, Amazon, the parent of Restoration Hardware and a few others hit hard by President Trump's tariff threats were down 40% on average late last week when the Georgia Republican pounced.  >...  >But however much she spent, some of her bets are working out so far, at least as of Wednesday's close, after markets soared on Mr. Trump's decision to pause most of his ""reciprocal tariffs"" on nations other than China for 90 days. Markets fell again Thursday, but remain above Wednesday morning's levels.  >RH, formerly called Restoration Hardware, is Greene's clear winner. It jumped more than a third since Friday's close, when she bought it after a stunning collapse in price that shook even the head of the furniture retailer.  >https://www.cbsnews.com/news/marjorie-taylor-greene-stocks-trump-tariffs/  and:  >**Democratic senators call for probe into possible insider trading over Trump tariff reversal**  >https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democratic-senators-call-probe-insider-trading-trump-tariff/story?id=120679375",progress18,2025-04-11T07:00:26,10
"I don't expect Congress to police themselves, and passing a law on themselves can be easily undone anyway. Does it take another Amendment like the 27th, or can this be effected another way?",GMeister249,2025-04-11T08:42:25,13

"Since we're talking about pipe dreams that'll never happen, we need to stop having ""basis for impeachment"" be the only way to get someone out of office. What we need to do is establish conditions under which the president, Supreme Court Justice, Senator, etc. where If they are found to do something illegal and convicted (which they should be able to be) they should immediately be removed from office without impeachment being necessary. It shouldn't take 2/3rds of Congress agreeing to kick the president out for the president to be able to be kicked out. Either they're guilty and they lose their job at the least or they're not and they keep their job.     At the very least, there should be impartial conditions under which someone like Trump has their ability to make executive orders frozen until they are tried and convicted when they commit a crime in office. When Trump breaks the law in the oval office in front of millions of people, it shouldn't take an impeachment proceeding to keep him from being able to rapid fire executive orders so fast the courts and Congress can't even address them all, like he's been doing.",immortalfrieza2,2025-04-16T19:44:00,1
"Would be helpful to amend the Stock Act of 2012 so that transactions are visible online (repealing the 2013 amendment), and so that there are additional restrictions on insider trading:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STOCK\_Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STOCK_Act)",socks,2025-04-11T07:26:20,8
"A real law passed by Congress would do it. It would just need to have real teeth and a good way to enforce it, as well as a DOJ willing to actually do that instead of just using the threat as blackmail.   Either the House or the Senate could change their rules to cover just their own members I believe. I mean they'll banish people over a dress code (they still get to vote, they just can't come on the House floor or whatever). Some members of congress have been permanently expelled by their own branch for various reasons.",Constant-Kick6183,2025-04-11T11:50:34,3
"Right, no trading stock directly or indirectly, and if government officials were solely allowed to own mutual funds, then they'd have a financial incentive to improve the country as a whole, as is their job to do, rather than deliberately screwing up the country, buying stocks from the companies that lowered as a result and then ""fixing"" the problem they created in order to raise stocks so they could make money off them.",immortalfrieza2,2025-04-16T19:35:47,1
