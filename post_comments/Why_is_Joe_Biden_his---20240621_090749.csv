"One thing I think gets overlooked with approval ratings is that a large part of your own party can disapprove of the person, but that doesn't mean they won't vote for them.  So, you're going to have people that disapprove because of one issue that's important to them, but it doesn't mean they won't vote for the person or don't approve of 10 other things they do that don't matter as much as the one big thing they disapprove of.",HaveaManhattan,2024-06-21T12:07:09,47

"There's tons of reasons. First off he's not very charismatic. Even accounting for his stuttering which IMO isn't a problem, he's just not a dynamic speaker or someone you really want to go out of your way to listen to. Second, he was really forced down people's throats. Despite an entire party of younger and more charismatic members, he became the candidate and for many Biden vs Trump was no choice. Third, he hasn't really been very present. While I don't blame him for crime, the economy, immigration...in the face of a disfunctional congress he could have done more to put them on blast or make executive orders. Instead, it seems like we rarely hear from him.  Possible most import, the media is terrible these days. So much opinion masquerading as news and making so many of us feel like we're pundits or in the know.",randonumero,2024-06-21T12:42:05,29
"Your premise is a bit faulty. The pandemic is old news, we didn't ""just"" come out of it, and only looking at ""covid recovery index"" doesn't exactly give you a good look of the overall economy.   The US is fighting inflation, most voters are citing increasing cost of life, shaky job prospects, and the perception of Biden focusing on foreign interests over domestic policy as their concerns. Interest rates are also rising and the housing bubble is getting worse.  The pandemic doesn't really matter when a lot of people think times are worse than pre-pandemic times. So it's not necessarily what Biden did, it's what he didn't do. If you've been running the country for 4 years and people don't really see tangible improvements, you will end up with a bad approval rating.

"He’s not historically unpopular. Bush Sr. went into his re-elect with approvals in the low 30s. His son left office in the 20s. Biden is in the low to mid 40s. Not great, but enough to beat Trump, who has worse negatives.   Bigger picture, every Western leader has their approvals below 45%. The reason why? We just went through a major pandemic with significant supply chain disruptions that created moderate price hikes throughout the world. Housing, food and fuel were all particularly impacted. Those costs hit the lower and middle classes the worst. Naturally this is a period where challengers looking to upend entire orders can gain traction. A lot of voters are fearful and worried for the future, all of which doesn’t benefit incumbents running for reelection.",miaminaples,2024-06-21T14:18:56,9

"All Republicans hate him because he is a communist who is also racist and anti-Christian and antisemitic and wants to tax like crazy and take our guns and put all white people like jail, plus, you know, he's a pedophile who drinks the blood of infants and all that. Plus, he is senile and incompetent and used complex, nefarious evil genius methods to steal the election in '20.  Most democrats disapprove because he is none of those things  and is frustratingly prone to compromise and work with Republicans and maintain the status quo.  How is he possibly supposed to make those two sides approve?  Look at the Israeli Palestinian conflict. 50% of the country wants us to support Israel no matter what, and the other 50% wants us to support the Palestinians no matter what. Both are wrong, and we need to oppose hamas and Iran while also trying to prevent chaos and death in Palestine - which seems to he Netanyahu's goal. Amercian interests demand a middle road, and thankfully, the president has the courage to take it, and that has literally everyone angry.   I believe Netanyahu is being overly brutal in part because he knows it angers Biden's base, and he wants to see trump elected and subsequently loses all restraint.",rogozh1n,2024-06-21T15:52:25,2
"Polarization and perhaps unrealistic expectations. People who probably would've answered ""don't care"" before have now formed extremely strong opinions, informed or otherwise (on either side).  Also, as a person who's always voted left, I can definitely say that there's nobody who can fill the shoes of Obama, for good or for ill. He continues to loom large over the party whether you agree with him or not, and as someone who supported him his departure from the Presidency was bittersweet in a lot of ways. He on one hand was incredibly popular (ya know, considering) and on the other, fell short of a LOT of the hopes that launched him into the presidency.   So Biden is fighting comparisons to Barack (who also, being realistic is more attractive charismatic AND compelling than him), AND to Trump, on top of essentially being in the job only because people hate the orange guy so much.  Like does anybody remember what Biden's actual platform was before getting elected? Cause I just remember ""I'm not that guy."" It was good enough to get votes but is not good enough to win loyalty, especially with the right wing media machine (and left wing skeptics) constantly angling to make him out as ineffective.",BellonaViolet,2024-06-21T13:09:35,0
"(Libertarian)  The short version is that life is more expensive and people can't afford groceries and other things as much. There is debate if this is entirely Biden's fault but he is in charge so he is going to be blamed.  There are many other reasons like the border crisis, multiple wars, and questionable foreign policy and energy policies.  And many think he is in mental decline too.  That doesn't mean that they are rushing out to vote for Trump but they might be. Trump isn't loved either though.  I will probably vote for neither.",brinerbear,2024-06-22T08:51:29,1
"The cost of living has become outrageous. Inflation is felt by just about every regular person every time they buy groceries, pay rent, or do anything. While both parties have become big spenders, the current administration has touted programs that profess to curb inflation while precisely doing the exact opposite. Good politics but bad policy. Continuously printing money for short term gains has had a long term impact on regular people. Like it or not, Biden (or his handlers) and the tsars that have been put place around him seem more out of touch with the realities of the commoner compared to the more populist right-wing candidate.  Foreign policy-wise, the Biden administration has not done themselves any favors either. The chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan ended in catastrophe and the entire nation, and world, watched it unfold in real time on television. The perception of weakness followed, and Russia invaded Ukraine. China has begun to lay the foundations for moving on Taiwan. Iran has funded and activated regional terror cells and puppets to attack Israel. All of this is correlated to the perception of foreign policy weakness and predictability that, like it or not, Trump did not give off. Trump was a lot of things, but predicable was not one of them — this served as a foreign policy strength.   People also see the numbers at which illegal border crossings are occurring at the southern border now versus when Trump was in office. Normal people see Biden and his mouthpiece Alejandro Mayorkas as intentionally letting the border get out of hand on purpose for political reasons which, ironically, have had bad political repercussions. There is a definite possibility that part of why Trump and the republicans didn’t come together at 11:59pm to pass a last minute bipartisan border bill because they wanted to run on it, but they wouldn’t have to if Biden hadn’t come into office on day one and overturn all of the border measures that Trump had enacted to prevent the border crisis. Messaging and bad policy are the roots of the humanitarian issue at the southern border and people see how much worse it is now. They believe that Biden and the democrats want uncapped immigration to both garner eventual voters and turn key states and districts blue, as well as drive down the wages of working class people, furthering the decline of the middle class.   Additionally, keep in mind the specter of the botched Pandemic response that hurt small business owners  and propaganda coming out in defense of lockdowns and government overreach. People don’t like being demonized by politicians, their bought-and-paid-for media mouthpieces, and celebrities.  Looking at all of these things that impact regular people, who do not like the overly-progressive messaging and possible threat to the nuclear family that they see everyday on social media, and in conjunction with Biden’s obviously declining mental faculties, I’m a bit confused why so many people still CAN’T seem to grasp why Joe Biden has this historically bad approval rating.",[deleted],2024-06-21T13:08:44,-2
"I'm not sure what you mean by ""historically"" unpopular.

"I think it has more to do with neoliberalism and the New Democrats failing to deliver on their laissez-faire promises. NAFTA, free trade, the destruction of the welfare state, all happened under Democrats. Incomes started stalling under Democrats (even though those issues were initiated under Republicans). Today Democrats are the more hawkish party, which is generally unpopular in the US as it becomes more isolationist.

"This is a fairly condescending and pandering take that implies anyone against Biden is just plain wrong - I bet it does fairly well with the usual crowd here.  The truth is - people do live in reality, and economic indicators don't always reflect the people's day to day lives. Your average American doesn't hang out on the internet all day. They're too busy working their a\*\* off and not seeing much in return.  So ironically, it's the opposite. People are seeing what they get in reality, and what the POTUS is saying and they see a disconnect.  US voters are unhappy with the economy in general, and that unhappiness will translate to the guy in charge of the country regardless of who he is. The COL has increased, the wages haven't followed, there's some fairly expensive wars the US is funding which created a perception of Biden not caring about the average voter.  His lack of mental acuity, along with his admin not clearly communicating his economic plans have also added to this.

They say that the definition of a machine gun is what the case is about, and they give the Court's reasoning for why bump stocks don't meet that definition.
