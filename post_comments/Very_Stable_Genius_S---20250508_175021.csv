[Trump threatens toymaker Mattel with 100% tariffs.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-administration-britain-tariffs-immigration-doge-live-updates-rcna204764/rcrd78862?canonicalCard=true),wenchette,2025-05-08T17:54:04,1
"I saw someone else say the targets are all on toys to focus the discussion of the hurt tariffs cause to be on childish things. Wanting a good economy should sound like whining about stuff you don't need, for the GOP to continue controlling the narrative.",BorntobeTrill,2025-05-08T17:57:25,30

"A 100% tariff would be a reduction from the 145% tariffs on China. Unfortunately, I believe it would be an ADDITIONAL 100%. A basic Barbie doll costs about $6 at Wal-Mart. The price will increase to $14.70 with a 145% tariff added, then to at least $20,70, presuming that the tariffs are not subject to additinal tariffs as the""new"" price of the item.  If Mattel shifts production to India as they plan, the tariff would be about 125% if the tarff on Barbies ges into effect.   The ban on Barbies goes on.",No_Philosopher_1870,2025-05-08T18:30:19,11

"This market manipulation. I guarantee people in trumps orbit bet against Mattel yesterday and will buy right before trump says publicly that made a deal or whatever. ¬†This has just been one big stock market scam. This isn‚Äôt about better trade deals or bring manufacturing back to America, it‚Äôs about insider trading. Period.¬†",Ashamed_Job_8151,2025-05-08T22:02:04,4

"I've had issues with the Orange one from the start, but I want to respect him and the office. Im not sure how he has all the issues with odd things he says, and there is no one there to make sure he doesn't.  He needs to be impeached and removed. The world already had a little dislike of America, now hes the one who is making sure they know that they really have to dislike us.",MethBaby75,2025-05-08T20:26:05,4
Let‚Äôs plan to call the Whitehouse as the ambassador demanding to speak to The Donald about tariffs so we can make a deal on behalf of the State of Mattel? Who‚Äôs in?

That strategy will fail.   1) Because most parents will be especially in tune with how children respond about what‚Äôs going on when shelves are empty and how empty the Christmas looks come next Christmas.   2) The government literally telling us we should only buy a couple dolls rather than however many we want is entirely unAmerican.,GeneralZex,2025-05-08T19:11:02,19

"I would expect the tariff to be based on the wholesale price of the item. However, as sales decline because people don't buy as much, the goods that are sold have to be sold at a high enough price to allow the retailer to maintain their usual profit.  This means that sales ALSO must pay a higher share of fixed costs.  Consider a store that buys items for $5, sells them at $10, and has to pay a 100% tariff based n the wholesale price of $5 ,Presume that demand is elastiic, meaning that as price goes up 10%, the amount sold will decline by some precentage. Suppose that normal sales are 10,000 units per month for income of $100,000. At $15, the store can expect to sell roughly 6667 for revenue of $100,000, but they will need to pay tariff on all items ordered. To keep income the same, the item has to be marked up to $18-20..  Another consequence of the tariffs is that order size will get smaller for at least two resons: tariff has to be paid at the port of entry and recovered from customers as the items are sold, and there is a risk that the tariffs will be redced or eliminated at some future date. amd companies don't want to be stuck with goods where they ad to pay atariff tat no longer applies.",No_Philosopher_1870,2025-05-09T08:31:41,1
