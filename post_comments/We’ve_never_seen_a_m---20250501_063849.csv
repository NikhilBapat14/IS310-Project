Well hold on a second.   Trumps first term got over 1 million Americans killed due to his negligence and completely tanked the economy. We are only 100 days into this one and he's not quite lived up to that just yet.,FreshRest4945,2025-05-01T06:43:53,389
"**TL;DR**: In his first 100 days, Trump‚Äôs second term has been marked by repeated blunders, from mistakenly threatening Harvard‚Äôs funding to wrongfully deporting immigrants and sending false deportation notices‚Äîeven to a U.S. citizen.

Critics argue this chaotic governance‚Äîdubbed ""rule by error""‚Äîreveals incompetence, as polls show record-low approval.",pharrt,2025-05-01T06:43:25,68
