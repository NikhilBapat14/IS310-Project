"Then Biden is next in line to be President if something happens to Harris. That just kicks the can on the age problem. Plus, as VP, he will be front and center on leadership in some delegated areas.",ParticularGlass1821,2024-07-13T05:54:58,8
"Are you asking *is this a good idea* or *is this politically possible*?  Either way, the answer is no. If Biden were to step down (even self-demotes to VP), then that's an acknowledgement that he's incapable of leading. If he's incapable of leading, he shouldn't be on the ticket.  And someone doesn't need to be VP in order to advise the president.",cossiander,2024-07-13T11:33:24,3
Biden has problems but Harris just isn't good at being front. There's zero charisma or anything she did on her own to sell to people.  Michelle Obama's who we need as first woman president and a person of power and grace,-Tasear-,2024-07-21T18:27:26,1
Because then cameltoe Harris is the president. Which might be worse then Biden wait. Wait till the vp debate and you’ll see. Or you are just so brainwashed you won’t,Responsible-Bad8583,2024-07-16T12:52:11,0
I want Biden front and center on foreign policy. He can handle that with grace.,az78,2024-07-13T12:15:50,0
