"I honestly think, if there's enough integrity left on the Supreme Court, that they should refer to congress an official request to hold an impeachment inquiry over Trumps complete disregard of their ruling regarding Abrego Garcia. There are many other impeachable offenses that he has committed, but this is one which the Supreme Court itself is directly involved because they made a ruling and Trump is refusing to follow it.   Since the court doesn't have direct enforcement powers, and Trump controls the Executive Branch, the only recourse the Supreme Court has is to make a formal referral to Congress for impeachment, otherwise they lose all power.",Reviews-From-Me,2025-05-09T14:45:04,27

"The Writ of Habeas Corpus Status: At Risk of Executive Suspension Date: May 9, 2025   Primary Source: U.S. Constitution – Article I, Section 9, Clause 2 (archives.gov)    [https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript#toc-section-9](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript#toc-section-9)    What it is: Habeas corpus is the constitutional right to challenge unlawful detention. It allows individuals to be brought before a court to determine whether their imprisonment or custody is legal.    Constitutional Text:    >“The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.” — U.S. Constitution – National Archives     Recent Statement: Stephen Miller, senior adviser to Donald Trump, stated on May 9, 2025, that the administration is “actively looking at” suspending habeas corpus, citing the constitutional clause and describing immigration as a form of “invasion.”    Historical Precedents:    Ex parte Milligan (1866): Habeas corpus cannot be suspended where civilian courts are operating.    Boumediene v. Bush (2008): The right applies to non-citizens held under U.S. authority.    Implication: Redefining “invasion” to include immigration could expand executive power to detain individuals—including civilians and non-citizens—without judicial review. Such a move would test the outer limits of constitutional authority and due process protections.",vucubcame,2025-05-09T14:36:16,42

That might actually be the *most* unconstitutional thing they could do.  Suspension of habeas corpus was a HUGE reason for some guys in 1776 getting together and declaring some self-evident truths.

"From the [Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/magna-carta-muse-and-mentor/writ-of-habeas-corpus.html): > King John’s Magna Carta guaranteed to all free men immunity from illegal imprisonment, a guarantee that has traditionally been invoked by way of the writ of habeas corpus. Under the concept of habeas corpus in Anglo-American jurisprudence, persons who are deprived of their liberty have the right to challenge the legality of their arrest or detention through a judicial inquiry. Habeas corpus is a Latin phrase meaning “produce the body.” By means of the writ of habeas corpus a court may order the state to “produce the body,” or hand over a prisoner so that it might review the legality of the prisoner’s detention.  > Although King John’s Magna Carta did guarantee protection from unlawful imprisonment, it did not establish a process by which a person might sue for his freedom. The association between Magna Carta’s protection and the writ of habeas corpus only took root in the seventeenth century following the conflict between the House of Commons and King Charles I, after which the writ of habeas corpus became one of the most important privileges associated with English liberties. It was reaffirmed in the Habeas Corpus Acts of 1640 and 1679 and appears frequently in discussions of constitutional rights throughout the era leading to American independence. It is one of the fundamental liberties mentioned in the body of the United States Constitution.",aleph32,2025-05-09T14:52:55,4

"The America we all grew up in is dead.  The one we convinced ourselves we were living in is gone.  America being the leader of the free world is done now.  We need to deal with the hurt, shake it off, and fight like hell to build something better than what we are being offered.  The oligarchs vision for the future is a perversion brought on by their disgusting worldview.  These are small men playing out pathetic god complexes at everyone's expense.  We are in the middle of a class war that most Americans are too stunned or propaganda sick to even notice and we are losing badly.  Everything happening right now is a coordinated dismantling and sale of our federal government to the would-be oligarchs.  The erosion of checks and balances, whereby Congress has ceded its power and SCOTUS stands impotent.  They are purposefully disregarding the courts to test their limits.  The destruction of government agencies in order to encourage poverty, illness, and crime in our communities to weaken our resistance. There will be no federal aid for the noncompliant.  The threatening of our lives and liberty with disgusting shows of force against those who speak out or simply seek refuge.    They have allowed American citizen children to be removed to test the public's reaction.  The disruption of global trade and domestic supply chains.  Nothing provides better cover for a massive upward transfer of wealth than a financial crisis.  We will be made to own nothing.  They have installed puppets at all levels of government.  Bondi and Patel are his personal attack dogs.  Miller provides the meat for the white nationalist base.  Hegseth is a drunk with a crusader fetish, but the reordering being done in the military command structures should alarm everyone.  Anyone with loved ones in the military should reiterate to them their oath includes not following illegal orders.  That they should refuse to deploy within US borders.  The destruction of our military alliances and global soft power serves to isolate us from the world and make domestic security worse overall.  While all of this is happening, they will begin to sell what is left piecemeal in the name of privatization. They are going to sell federal land to allow more technocratic company towns like ""starbase"" in TX.  I need everyone to really look at what is going on in our country.  Think about the implications carefully.  So many are still talking about this as if it is just politics.  ""We'll get em in the midterms"" is not good enough because unless we have drastic changes in policy, I don't see us having free and fair elections by then.",Oi_cnc,2025-05-09T18:04:20,5

"Declaration of Broken Contract When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for the people to dissolve the political bonds which have connected them to a governing body that no longer abides by its own Constitution, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all persons are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Justice. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to withhold consent, to demand redress, and to seek the restoration of lawful and just governance. The social contract has been broken. The government has failed in its most fundamental obligation: to protect and represent the People, as required by the Constitution. The sacred promise of representation (Article I, Section 2), due process (Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments), and equal protection under the law (Fourteenth Amendment) has been violated. When leaders defy constitutional limits, disregard judicial authority, and use public funds to abuse, neglect, or silence the governed, the moral and legal legitimacy of their authority collapses. In this condition, taxation becomes exploitation, a direct violation of the founding American principle: ""No taxation without representation."" This principle, enshrined in the Declaration of Independence and echoed in the Petition Clause of the First Amendment, affirms the right of citizens to withhold consent when governmental legitimacy is lost through systemic violation of the Constitution. Therefore, we assert that We the People cannot be compelled to fund a system that no longer honors its constitutional duties. To do so would be to participate in our own oppression, and further enable the erosion of our liberties. Until justice is restored, representation honored, and constitutional protections upheld, we reserve under our First Amendment rights, the right to withhold consent, demand redress, and pursue all lawful means of restoring a government that serves its people. LIBERTY OR NOTHING AT ALL --- GRIEVANCES --- 1. Violation of Due Process Rights (Fifth & Fourteenth Amendments) - U.S. citizens have been wrongfully detained and deported without legal hearings or access to counsel. Examples: VML, a 2-year-old U.S. citizen, deported to Honduras. A 4-year-old cancer patient, deported with family. Kilmar Abrego Garcia, deported in defiance of court order. 2. Violation of Equal Protection (Fourteenth Amendment) - Citizens of specific ethnic or national backgrounds disproportionately targeted for deportation or data surveillance. 3. Illegal Disclosure of Personal and Financial Data (Privacy Act of 1974 & Fourth Amendment) - Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) accessed IRS and Treasury data (SSNs, bank info) without legal basis. 4. Violation of ""No Taxation Without Representation"" - Citizens are being taxed by a government failing to uphold constitutional duties. 5. Suppression of Redress and Petition (First Amendment) - Citizens who speak out or file complaints face retaliation or are ignored.",These-Photo-5731,2025-05-09T17:52:40,2

"Just another step that the Trump administration is taking towards full blown authoritarianism.  The only thing that Trump has done since ""day one"" is flout the law.  He has literally set a record for executive orders signed and a vast amount of them have been challenged by the courts.  He continues to live up to the criticism that he is a dictator; sidestepping congress; ignoring checks and balances; threatening anyone who presents an obstacle to his administration's agenda, and all while he plays coy in the face of scrutiny from critics, judges, journalists, and the media, all of whom have tried to hold him accountable for his unlawful and unconstitutional actions.  In his first 100 days, Trump has signed over 140 executive orders, setting the record by far.   FDR held the previous record with 99 EOs, Joe Biden signed 42.  This is also concerning because Republicans aren't really passing any meaningful legislation in Congress. Instead, they're unquestionably yielding their power to Trump, allowing him to assert his unitary executive powers—as outlined in Project 2025 of course—so he can enact the party's agenda via these unconstitutional EOs.  The more that Republicans capitulate to Trump and the more that he continues to overstep congressional authority, the more likely it is that he will help the party consolidate power for the foreseeable future. Meaning that their jobs will be less at risk.  This will also help empower Trump to pressure congress to fund his mass deportation raids and migrant camps.  And Stephen Miller—the little shit weasel he is—has been enabling this all along the way,.  After Trump won the election, Miller moved himself and his family to Palm Beach to both be closer to Trump and play a closer role in his presidency.  Miller has played a sizeable role in helping craft policies like the ""zero tolerance"" policy and Muslim travel bans. He's also been involved in efforts to end the DACA program.  Miller and his team are actually responsible for drafting some of these EOs over the years, including orders to end birthright citizenship, to institute travel bans, to separate families, to declare national emergencies, to make it near impossible for some migrants to obtain green cards, to designate drug cartels as foreign terrorists (which wouldn't sound as severe if Miller didn't have ulterior motives), and to reinstate title 42.   Title 42 was that COVID emergency policy that allowed the Trump administration to swiftly deport or expel all types of migrants without processing.  This policy helped Trump fudge his immigration numbers and also created a backlog of border crossings for the next administration to handle.  Trump's reliance on title 42 was pretty hypocritical considering how him and his supporters downplayed COVID constantly, yet still used it as the sole basis for the policy.  What's more, it's also been reported that a team of Trump advisors, likely including Miller, have been trying for months to identify a disease that they can use to reinstate Title 42. A move that is very similar to the kind of conspiracy theories that Trump supporters have accused Democrats of being embroiled in.  Miller has had a major influence on the Trump administration, especially when it comes to how these executive orders are being drafted and implemented.  For example, when it comes to the process of drafting an EO, the presidential administration is supposed to send them to the DOJ's office of legal counsel where an independent career lawyer reviews them to determine their legality.  But here's the slimy part. Miller has been using his own team of lawyers from outside the DOJ to examine and review the orders. Sometimes his own orders.  This is particularly corrupt because the lawyer that normally fills this role is hired to be impartial and is also deliberately sectioned off from any influences within the administration.  So Miller's job here is to eliminate all roadblocks to Trump's immigration agenda.  Miller has also accomplished this by lobbying for his equally insufferable allies to fill positions within the Trump administration where they will be responsible for arranging mass deportations to other countries.  He's also used his power and leverage with Trump to form relationships with prominent lawmakers who will see to it that Congress appropriates funding for more sweeping immigration raids, harsher national security measures, the use of the military to conduct arrests and build massive camps to detain migrants. These are all things that Miller supports.",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-05-09T17:52:17,4

"Study the political career of Ferdinand Marcos Sr. and you’ll see where American is heading under Trump and his minions.    The nexus between Trump and Marcos is Paul Manafort who Marcos hired in the late 1970s and who was reportly the ‘bagman’ for a 4-8 million dollar illegal contribution to Reagan during is campaign against Jimmy Carter in 1980 which was overshadowed by the Iran-Contra scandal from the same election.    I was serving at the US Embassy in Manila in 83-87 during the slow-roll overthrow of Kleptocrat Marcos which started during a live broadcast of the TV Show Nightline when Ted Koppel asked him when he was going to hold an election after having suspended the writ of habeas corpus by executive order in 1973 due to what most believed where manufactured ‘false flag’ terrorist acts / assassination attempts.  Marcos, who had been convicted of murdering his political rival in 1934 but acquitted by corrupted judge, was very charismatic and popular with the people. After being acquitted he got elected to the Philippine House, Senate and then the Presidency in 1959 after which the systematically corrupted the top leadership of the Military, members of his party and the Judicial branch modeled on the US system with classic ‘machine’ patronage politics.  His downfall was the result of kidney disease which shattered the illusion he was invincible and dissent and rebellion at the Colonel level and below whose careers had been stifled when Marcos, during Martial Law, nationalized large companies and put his loyal Generals in charge of them while also retaining their military jobs, freezing promotions for everyone else.  I had an insider’s view of what happen in the Philippines.  I was watching Nightline in 1983 when Ted Koppel asked Marcos on live TV when he was going to hold another election and arrived for my first overseas assignment as FP01 / GS-15 level Deputy Director / Production Manager of USIA’s Manila 147 employee Printing Center on the US Embassy Compound in August 83, just a week after Ninoy Aquino was gunned down at the same airport gate I arrived at. The following year I wound up taking SCUBA lessons from the well connected daughter-in-law of a Marcos cabinet official, and one of my printing center colleagues was next door neighbor to and friends with the Aquino family in one of Manila’s gated communities. From that and my Embassy contacts got insight into what was really happened. I returned to Manila from 90-95 as Exec. Officer and 99-01 as Director and witnessed first hand what happened afterwards.  The only real difference here in the US is that the ‘Military/Industrial Complex’ Eisenhower warned the country about on is way out in 1960 has corrupted the top ranks of the government, not the President, but it also pulls his puppet strings. The incentive for the top military brass all the way down to the Lt. Col level are very remunerative ‘revolving door’ board seats and defense contractor jobs.    I had a Virginia next-neighbor who was a Marine Lt. Col involved with the development of the F-35 fighter who retired and was immediately hired by a defense contract at six-digit salary. John Solomon, the Fox TV pundit who broke the Ukraine Ambassador story while setting up The Hill TV was my neighbor on the other side. The TV remote truck would pull into his drive and he’d get in and sit in front of a green screen to do his Hannity segments.   I grew up he son of a Daley Machine Block Captain on Chicago’s South sided and became a Zen loving long-haired, bearded hippie photographer at college who understood by age eight politics in both parties runs on Patronage with the prize at all levels—City, County, State, Federal being the Executive branch which in the Federal Govt. allows the President to appoint 30,000 top level “Schedule C” political operatives in the top policy and management levels of every department and agency. They are in my experience the real source of waste and inefficiency in the government but untouchable politically because both parties benefit equally.    I’ve had an ‘insider’ view since moving from Chicago to Washington in 1972 during the middle of the breaking Watergate Scandal when it was still like a sleepy Southern town in the summer with men in seersucker suits and straw hats and Col. Sanders regularly seen on K street were the KFC HQ was wearing his white suit and black string. I was a wannabe photojournalist and during the summer of 72 worked for a Capitol Hill freelancer who regularly shot ‘grip and grin’ photos for lobbyists with Senators and Congressmen in the Capitol, Senate and House office buildings.   What motivates most of Republican financial bundlers and Democrat community organizers who take the Sch C. jobs isn’t patriotism it is the prospect of being rewarded with an easy job with a six-figure salary.  They are the real Swamp Creatures.    By the time I reached age thirty in 1980 I realize the only way to beat the system was to join it “asking not what my country could do for me, but what I could do for my country.” when seeing an ad in the Washington Post placed by USIA seeking printing production managers, what I was doing at the time for a large DC printer.  Over  my 28 years with USIA and State I printed and distributed hundreds of thousands of copies of the Declaration of Independence and Constitution to every country in the world with a US Diplomatic presence to be given away to ‘influencers’, teachers and students in the ‘second’  (Communist) and ‘third’ (Non-aligned) world giving me  ‘bigger picture’ perspective than most.  The reality is that the Constitution has very little to do with Democracy.  It is instead a ‘Rule of Law’ framework designed by the white elite founding fathers to keep their socio-economic Capitalist spawn in power in perpetuity. It pandered to the Southern States by giving every State two Senate seats and letting the State Legislators not the voters pick them, something not changed by amendment until the early 1930.  The founding fathers were so myopic about the future growth of the country they called for one House seat for every 30,000 warm bodies (not citizens) counted every ten years in the Census which if not changed in 1929 —by Congressional bill, not Amendment—would have resulted in a House of Representative with 1,100 members!  Even in 1789 the House members were not ‘Democratically’ representing their citizen constituents because non-citizen residents and black slaves counted as 3/5 a person where included in the tally used to decide how many seats each state got with the districts being redrawn by the partisan legislators in the states which resulted in me being ‘Gerrymandered’ after the 2020 Census NoVA from a District represented by Democrat Gerry Connolly to one represented by Republican Rob Wittman which I only discovered in 2022 when I saw Wittman campaign signs.  Both parties are inherently corrupted by greed and meglomania in my experience but at least the Democratic Party seems willing to abide by the Rule of Law and modify it as necessary to make it more equitable.  But it went too far pandering to minorities who grew up depending on government welfare, un-regulated immigration and the fringe left to win elections that it it lost the support of the few remaining moderates and independent swing voters who since 2000 have determined which party wins elections.  The Democratic Party strategy now seems to be one ineffectual ‘jawboning’ while letting Trump and MAGA drive the country to the edge of the abyss of Fascism in the hope the backlash will help it win back control of the Senate (where the real power is) and the House (which is just the ‘snake-oil selling’ Carnival side show the founding fathers intended it to be).",VA_CHP,2025-05-10T12:10:13,1

He stopped Texas from defending the border.   The media waged a disinformation campaign.   And social media company let people like you continue that same disinformation campaign.    Biden funded the NGOs bringing people here and his administration had CBP babysitting this illlegal migrants instead of preventing them from coming.   None of them were caught and sent back even when their arrivals into waiting cars were caught on film.   Deals were setup with hotels to book out for these illegal migrants.   It also has been happening to other countries all over Europe.
