"Can you imagine for a second a US elections outcome being the result of another countries president? That’s so patently absurd to even think about isn’t it? Yet that’s what happened here. Some think it’s great, some don’t but nobody is denying this happened because of Trump.",chillthrowaways,2025-04-30T04:54:07,34

"This is the SAME Canada that held joint military drills IN CANADA with China, the worst enemy of the U.S. Spare me the bullshit of, “Canada has been a great ally of the U.S., and they (the U.S.) stabbed us in the back by applying tariffs on our goods.” Canada has been a shitty neighbor. I hope Trump applies more pressure until they have to admit defeat.",VerusPatriota,2025-04-30T00:24:30,18

The Canadian dollar is already at a low.  They are going to inflate their currency and sink it further.  4-5 years from now they will be begging to become #51,Aronacus,2025-04-29T18:57:33,-45

Why did people vote for this? In what world does it make any sense to do this and continue the destruction of your nation? Just because of Trump?,krazyellinas23,2025-04-29T18:08:17,17
Here’s the funny thing about Trump. It always seems like he’s doing something crazy but in the end it works out. I don’t know how but it does.  So do I see any benefit to the Canada stuff? No. But I also wouldn’t be surprised if things did work out in the end. Not saying it will but just wouldn’t be surprised,chillthrowaways,2025-04-30T16:07:28,1
"Everytime this topic comes up these Canucks think it'll be an epic war to take Canada.   It won't be.   Native Canadians have a near zero birth rate.  They are mass importing foreigners, mostly from India.  By 2031 Canadians will be a minority in their own country.  What will happen next?  Will the USA go in with all its military might?   Nope,  the Canadian economy will have collapsed under its social programs.  They will be asking us to save them.   Just think,   this was a nation who is pro-worker who couldn't stand with their Truckers. You know,  the people who haul their food",Aronacus,2025-04-30T05:37:22,5

"The vast majority of Canadians are completely asleep, and terrified of social disapproval. That's what I think it comes down to. We deserve what we get if we're that scared of observing reality, like 93% of population growth being from immigration last year...  Also for what it's worth, that Pierre Poilievre guy is not any better either, since he's a fake conservative. He knows how to say all the right things, but if you dig into his policies, he segways towards larger government and less provincial autonomy. He's a WEF shill all the same.  The only real anti-globalist candidate, IMO, is [Maxime Bernier](https://x.com/RealAlexJones/status/1903240151049867775). He states facts openly and brazenly like Trump, and his name is HEAVILY censored everywhere. That fact he's censored suggests to me he's his own man, and not a WEF puppet (plus he's based enough to appear on the Alex Jones show lol).  So we were screwed either way in this election, since the choice was effectively between just Carney and Poilevre. The question now is whether enough people will wake up to let us bounce back, after things inevitably get worse...",NoTime_SwordIsEnough,2025-04-29T18:27:40,3
Canadians are brainwashed and just follow social proof / authority. All their media is under massive gov funding so the incentives are backward and support the bad guys. Also they import millions of new canadians a year who replace any votes for change. And even if they could get fed up enough to support real change the courts and senate are completely stacked with the old guard establishment loyalists on the left so there is zero chance they can be challenged. If you leave a group in power for too long they can stack everything with their loyalists and consolidate power and that's what's happened in Canada. They can control public opinion because anyone who steps out of line gets punished.,day25,2025-04-30T01:59:38,1
