"Let's see if it has any teeth. I really hope it does. To Kid Rocks credit a few years ago he did a tour where he charged $20 per ticket, that's it. If the show sold out he just added another date to that venue and sold more tickets. He ended up doing like 17 straight shows in Detroit. Started with 8, added 2 more, then added like 5 more after that and a couple extra IIRC. So he is actually one of the people that can stand up there and talk about sticking it to the man on ticket prices. Idk if he's changed since then but I've never seen someone repeatedly fuck over scalpers like he did on that tour.",rendeld,2025-03-31T21:10:06,2
