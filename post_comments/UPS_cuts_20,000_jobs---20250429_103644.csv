"The slowdown in shipping is one thing, but it's looking like we're going to have a helluva time bouncing back in the future if there are massive layoffs happening this early.

If possible can you link a source for that percentage? Most data I have seen myself has been forecasting a 10-35% drop in expected traffic this coming quarter. Just trying to pool all relevant studies and sources,Nickpb,2025-04-29T17:19:35,1
