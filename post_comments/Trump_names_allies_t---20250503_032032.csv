"WITKOFF: ""We must ... fight hatred wherever it exists""  Right.  NEVER Again, right...?   US celebrates retaliatory appointments to the Holocaust Memorial while spitting lies at the ICJ DEFENDING Israel's genocide-in-progress: aid blockade of Gaza, weaponized starvation, and forced displacements of Palestinians in the West Bank.    [https://www.npr.org/2025/04/30/nx-s1-5382383/international-court-of-justice-israel-unrwa-palestinians-us](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/30/nx-s1-5382383/international-court-of-justice-israel-unrwa-palestinians-us)  After claiming he'd end the 'war' in 24 hours, and failing to continue the Ceasefire Biden setup, Trump has shown - once again - that he's a feckless liar who likes nothing better than buddying-up and aiding fugitive War Criminals.  Victims of War Criminals?  Not his problem.  THey don't have 'the cards'.  If anti-semitism is growing, it can't POSSIBLY be due to a ""Roman-Saluting"" coPresident whose platform has multiplied anti-semitic comments since he took over, or his AfD support, or the ""Jews Will Not Replace Us"" Trumpies who are ""very fine people""?  How about the J6 ""tourists"" w Adolf's flags on display?  Trump's latest message to ""be good to Gaza"" while they're literally dying of STARVATION?  Must be felon-to-war-criminal code for something else.  Kind of like Leon's holocaust jokes - all in good fun.",XSinTrick6666,2025-05-03T05:17:51,5
">In a social media post late Thursday, President Donald Trump announced eight new appointees to the board of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum to replace the [board members he ordered removed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/2025/04/29/holocaust-memorial-museum-board-trump/) days earlier, all of whom had been appointed by President Joe Biden. Many of them are allies or supporters of the president, including two conservative media personalities and a lawyer who represented him.  >“It is my pleasure to announce the appointments of Betty Schwartz, Fred Marcus, Rabbi Pinchos Lipschutz, Sid Rosenberg, Ariel Abergel, Barbara Feingold, Alex Witkoff, and Robert Garson to the United States Holocaust Memorial Council,” [Trump posted](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114436165701323476) on his Truth Social account. “This Council has the important task of preserving the memories and stories of the loved ones whose lives were robbed in one of the darkest moments in History. NEVER FORGET!”  >Witkoff, a real estate developer, is the son of Steve Witkoff, a friend of the president and real estate lawyer who now serves as his envoy to the Middle East and Russia. In a[ post on X](https://x.com/Alex_Witkoff/status/1918305557301121179), Witkoff said he was proud to be appointed to the council by Trump.  >“As a Jewish American, this fight is personal,” he wrote. “Antisemitism is rising — we must remember, act, and fight hatred wherever it exists.”  >Rosenberg, a personality for New York’s WABC, a conservative talk radio station, said [in an Instagram Story post](https://www.instagram.com/stories/rosenberg.sidney/3623375754088373171/?hl=en) that Trump “bestowed me with the honor of a lifetime.” He then shared multiple posts from others congratulating him on the appointment.  >Rosenberg told [Arutz Sheva-Israel National News](https://www.israelnationalnews.com/news/407734) he was in Israel when he received the appointment. “Finding out about this honor while standing in Israel — on my third mission here since October 7th — was surreal. I’ve always used my voice to fight antisemitism, to defend Israel, and to speak the truth when too many stay silent,” he said.",Amazing-Buy-1181,2025-05-03T03:22:32,2

"There is no record of Romans using such a salute.  It only appears in one Renaissance painting of Romans, the oath of the horatii",Admirable_Link_9642,2025-05-03T08:02:42,5

In the usa it was called the Bellamy salute before the war and it has a Wikipedia page.,Admirable_Link_9642,2025-05-03T15:54:30,0

"That’s the bs Joe Rogan tried to claim and it’s not at all true. The bellamy salute looks nothing like hitlers salute aside from using a right hand and lifting it, which is basically all salutes.    You can’t look at those two salutes and confuse them unless you’re looking at just a photo and squinting your eyes",khronos127,2025-05-04T05:28:26,1
