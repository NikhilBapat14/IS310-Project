Skeptical? They are STEALING from the public coffers... the rich are pillaging the poor you low IQ oxygen pirates.,addled_and_old,2025-04-28T10:59:14,27
"They made cuts without any due diligence. They did no formal analyses and therefore did not prove that there was waste. The $160 billion figure, and any figure they quote, is made up nonsense. Anyone with an ounce of critical reasoning knows how much legwork would be necessary to justify the cuts they made. DOGE is a farce.",irishnugget,2025-04-28T11:11:18,9
"Even DOGE’s inflated self reported figures are nowhere near the $1 trillion in savings promised (which was itself revised down from $2 trillion promised on the campaign trail).  Musk has constantly accused completely innocent Americans of committing fraud, despite the fact none of these claims have lead to any actual charges being filed.  Musk has routinely mischaracterized the projects being cancelled, and has to be regularly corrected for making false claims.  Musk and DOGE have been an unmitigated disaster for the administration. It honestly is looking like Trump is just giving Musk this pretend job so he can feel important and continue propagandizing for Trump, and it keeps him busy and gets him out of Trump’s hair.",epicredditdude1,2025-04-28T11:02:11,4
"I'd like to know what these people think ""waste"" is that DOGE was supposedly targeting?  Aside from the obvious pork (and even that has benefits) government spending is an investment in the country and the country's future.  For the credentials government employees have they're largely underpaid, and quite a bit of their salary returns right into government coffers through income taxes. These people are ""cheap"" and there's no one skimming a profit off the top.",CockBrother,2025-04-28T11:07:13,3

"They've ""saved"" a miniscule amount of money relative to the budget and the cost has been to ruin the lives of thousands of families with blanket layoffs.",Searchlights,2025-04-28T11:04:53,1
Could have focused on all the waste in the military. Instead they just happen to cut all the programs that were investigating Musk for crimes...,ActualModerateHusker,2025-04-28T12:16:52,1

Didn’t realize a powder room at the pentagon for a tv host cosplaying the head of the pentagon was “essential.”,dakotanorth8,2025-04-28T18:04:15,1
"He saved like a billion dollars by making hundreds of thousands of Americans jobless while Congress wastes trillions on BS, and Musk steals 50 billion in government contracts.   Art of the deal and so on…….. lol  Who does this deal benefit again? The MAGA in Idaho whose going to lose his farm?",Mars8,2025-04-28T21:43:29,1
"Government is cutting waste , every department that was wasting time on investigations on Elon has been close , costly negotiations for a faire market price for new contracts saved .. just cut the deal with Elon and jobs  done",nobackup42,2025-04-28T12:40:31,0
The CFPB was particularly bad. We need the budget people to figure out how much more debt you create when you cut a program that cost 800 million but delivered over 30 billion to Americans. Without that 30 billion you get less spending on goods and services and less taxation as it revolves through the economy. It ends up costing the government more money in lost revenue than it saved.   To some extent that is true with every program that was cut. DOGE won't look at this higher level analysis at all ,ActualModerateHusker,2025-04-28T12:19:01,2
If you add in the costs of firing all those govt employees and lost revenue and productivity DOGE actually cost the US govt like $118 billion AFTER you take their “savings” into account.,RustToRedemption,2025-04-28T11:37:26,4
