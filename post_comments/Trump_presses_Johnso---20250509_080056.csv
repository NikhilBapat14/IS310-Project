I think Trump is coming to terms with the fact that DOGE cuts aren‚Äôt going to be anywhere near what he expected and he‚Äôll need to raise taxes on some of the wealthy to afford his tax cuts. Medicare and SSA reforms need to be made to balance the budget.¬†,roaming_art,2025-05-09T08:42:14,330

"Because the impacts and justifications of this tax code change are identical to the impacts and justifications for removing the long term capital gains tax rate in general. That would be an insane proposal for a wide variety of reasons and the only difference here is just the scope of the impact.  > The group that needs direct relief from tax cuts is the middle class.  The bad news is that all taxes end up in transactions. When you increase the risk of private equity management and decrease competitiveness, this is going to be reflected in how much capital private businesses have access to. This is primarily going to have consequences for small to mid-sized businesses that rely on this kind of investment. This means fewer middle class positions or at the very least worse paying middle class positions. This employee pay is ultimately where the majority of this tax will end up completely kneecapping the whole point of giving ""relief"" to the middle class.  And of course, it will certainly bring in less revenue than expected as funds will shift away from compensating long term, high performance and likely move to direct fees. I think everyone can see how bad of an idea it would be to make long term investments less desirable relative to short term performance.",cplusequals,2025-05-09T14:48:24,-30
