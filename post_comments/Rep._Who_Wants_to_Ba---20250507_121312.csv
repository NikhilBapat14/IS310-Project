"Rep. Rob Bresnahan introduced a new bill that seeks to ban members of Congress (and their spouses) from trading in stocks. “I have never traded my own stocks, but I want to guarantee accountability to my constituents,” the congressman insisted.   So imagine the surprise when a site monitoring trades by lawmakers showed Bresnahan to be one of the most active freshman traders in Congress during his first months on the Hill. The 35-year-old made 357 trades up until April 8 with a volume of $4.1 million, according to the site.

"Maybe I’m crazy but I don’t fault someone for playing the game by the rules as they advocate the rules be changed. He’d be a hypocrite if it said the laws should chance *and* politicians should immediately stop trading, then continued to trade himself.",jigsaw_faust,2025-05-07T15:01:24,3

"You could have just not lied about it bro.    Like a manager who voted against the universal DH isn't hypocritical for using one if he loses the vote, just be honest about it.",AverageSizePeen800,2025-05-07T16:23:00,1
"It is outrageous that he insisted he never traded his own stocks, only to pull this stunt (typically Republican I suppose) but in the defense of Democrats who eventually pull the same stunt, I believe earnestly that people like me should pay higher taxes and when we work in government should be required to invest in something like the world market/ national bonds appropriate to our risk profile.       But I will not stop holding random penny stocks (even if I became a politician) and refusing to pay a single penny more in taxes than I am legally obligated to until every other sort-of-wealthy person (and wealthier) are all required to do the same.",The_Baron___,2025-05-07T19:26:09,1
