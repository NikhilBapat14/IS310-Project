"The amount of sugar in products is just so ridiculous, a regular 12oz can of Pepsi has about 41 grams of sugar, around 83% of your entire daily value in a single can alone! There’s no way you can’t produce a Pepsi that doesn’t have nearly your entire recommend amount of sugar in a single day right?

"Not really. Many libertarians support government restrictions against harming individuals using violent or deceitful tactics. Sugar in massive quantities is a slow poison on the population.   Its use as an additive to many foods not just sweets increases their addictive qualities intentionally causing over consumption by the companies that provide these goods.  This isn’t the same as a consumer choosing to purchase drugs, this is equivalent of sprinkling crack on your hamburger without you knowing.  Companies often hide their use of sugar on ingredients lists too. They list ingredients they used which are often preprocessed ingredients that they probably requested have sugar additives so that it’s more invisible.",25nameslater,2025-04-22T23:19:28,18
