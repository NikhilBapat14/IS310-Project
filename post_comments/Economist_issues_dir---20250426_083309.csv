"The problem is that the left believes in the keynesian economic system. The system says to lower taxes in bad times which the democrats conveniently forget.  While Conservatives embrace the Austrian economic system, which is more closely aligned with Capitalism and Free Market economics.  The economists who are crying doom and gloom believe in Keynesian Economics.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-26T08:53:19,-46
"Markets go up.  Markets go down.  That is the name of the game and if liberals cared beyond MSM headlines they'd know this.  Bull markets make you money, bear markets make you rich.  By all means liberal, sell off.  Can't play the game with feelings>facts like an overly emotional baby.  Come with objective metrics and a plan or GTFO.",Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-04-26T09:44:45,-30
"IDK.  I remember when the media accused W Bush of ""trying to talk down the economy"" when he was running for Prez.  I guess it's OK to try to 'talk down the economy' when a Republican is President.....",arcanjil,2025-04-27T07:05:37,0

"The problem is that Keynesian economics has been driving economic policymaking since the 30s and accelerated massively in its takeover of the system in the 70s.  We are dependent on it.  Ripping it out will break a lot before anything gets fixed, and our current crop of congressman are more worried about their seat at the table then they are about the system failing.   They know they'll be able to blame the worst failures on the executive and skate by with a few seats moving one way or the other on the margins but most will survive no matter what happens, meaning the executive who tries for a long term fix with short term pain will just be replaced before their plan produces results.  Or worse, they just end up giing the economy temporary room to bear the burden of more wasteful empty promises backed by excessive debt and money printing.   Congress not committing to the change means, ultimately, we are stuck on these tracks until they cant be laid down fast enough to outrun the train and it derails.  But theyll never be held accountable so why bother volunteering for it. That was the whole benefit to them of delegating so much control over the economy to the executive in the first place.",Lina_Inverse,2025-04-26T11:01:04,12

"We are not dependent on it. It is more properly a THEORY.   Basically as it is a bit more involved and would take up books.  Keynesian economicsÂ advocates for government intervention to stabilize the economy during recessions and depressions. This intervention can take the form of fiscal policy, such as increasing government spending or reducing taxes, and monetary policy, which involves actions by the central bank to manage the money supply and interest rates.  While the Austrian theory is....  The Austrian Business Cycle Theory posits that business cycles are caused by distortions in the money supply and credit, leading to malinvestment and subsequent economic downturns. According to this theory, government intervention to mitigate these downturns can exacerbate the problem.  They are both theories. While I have spent a lot of time over the years learning about both since I have  been arguing for Austrian Theory, or basically Free Market, I have watched also in the last 45 yeas and it is obvious to me that the Democrats favor the invasive and damaging Keynesian theory while the Republicans, at least back in time have favored Austrian. The policies and laws passed by each side show how they bolster one over the other.   Only a few things need to be addressed and removed.   1: Federal Income Tax   2: Federal Reserve   3: The bloated government.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-26T12:35:22,6

"The Fed is about the only thing that would cause problems.  Taxes and Size of Government.  Hell they are shrinking government with DOGE and it is working by saving us money.   Taxes, well we survived on a tiny government and tariffs before they put taxes in.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-26T13:25:26,-2
