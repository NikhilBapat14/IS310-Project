"I used to be in charge of recruiting bus drivers at my old job, and part of my job was sending out the DEI hiring notices. Quick breakdown of what that actually entails:    Our HR dept would post the job postings internally to Workday, externally to our website, and also to places like Indeed.   They had a database of organizations that help people find jobs (Veterans, women, minorities, immigrants, LGBT, special needs, etc.). Part of my job was contacting them. I don't know why HR didn't do this part as well. I didn't work for HR.  When we opened a new job posting, I'd send out pre-gen emails to about a dozen of these organizations saying ""Hey, do you know anybody who would be interested in driving a public transit bus?"". I didn't have a minimum requirement, or if I did, I never got anywhere near it. I just went with however many organizations were available and within like 50 miles of us. Didn't really expect people to move a huge distance just to drive a bus.   Of all of them, none of the women-focused ones or LGBT ones responded. The special needs org did, but they were looking for jobs like janitors. The immigrant place got us 2 drivers, but one of them we had to let go because he couldn't pass the CDL exam.   You know what that left us with? The veteran organizations. I think at one point 40% of our applicants were retired veterans.    And importantly, this didn't affect who we hired. It just affected who saw our postings and applied. If you met the minimum requirements, we'd give you an interview, and we'd probably offer you the job because we were hella understaffed.   All this anti-DEI nonsense has done for that place is limit the amount of veteran orgs that see those job postings",AnNoYiNg_NaMe,2025-04-22T13:50:42,18
"Not sure your point. I agree without any DEI efforts or intent, both admins are statistically more likely to hire the white guy. My point was the goal was still typically to hire the qualified white guy, even if you picked someone more likely to agree with you, they still had standards of qualification that this admin has completely ignored at every turn casting it as ""anti-DEI"" when it's pro neopotism and cronyism.   Even his first admin had plenty of people fit for the role. Nepotism and cronyism have always been an issue, it has not been a literal political movement tied to anti-DEI efforts leading to the flagerant installing of the most unfit cabinet in American history.   His admin and movement this time is NOT like the previous time or previous admins. Nore was the openess in not only hiring unqualified white folks, but the heavy removal of qualified white folks across critical organizations and infrastructure.   It's a confederacy of dunces, actual morons.
