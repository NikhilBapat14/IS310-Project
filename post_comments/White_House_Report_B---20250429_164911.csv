This is going to kill a lot of us and I bet no one does shit. I can‚Äôt be without my hormones I will literally die. Google what happens to us when hormones are removed from post op trans.  Can we ramp up the outrage United States ? Because you doing nothing proves you hate trans people more than you hate trump or your just a coward. I‚Äôm marching every weekend let‚Äôs get this asshole out of office. Otherwise I‚Äôm making a YouTube documenting my death from not taking my hormones since I can‚Äôt exactly leave unless someone can help me transfer my teaching certificate to another country asap.,Special-Rough-3946,2025-04-29T17:04:25,19

"Every time they pass new bullshit restricting the rights of Trans people I think, ""Okay can we leave them alone yet?"" and the answer is always no because it's not about ""science"" or anyone's fucking safety.  I don't give a single fuck what you think about my use of the word after 10 years of being called alarmist.  This is fucking genocide.",obligatorythr0waway,2025-04-30T05:27:44,3

"Because they're weak.    I just turned 40 and when I was young, we used to casually use slurs to describe anyone who deviated from the heteronormative structure.   It is intellectually dishonest to say that we didn't mean it cruelly. The harm is inherent. It was more a question of exposure to different ways of being human and the slow creep of social norms towards acceptance.   Easy to describe someone as a f or a t. Hard to know someone that the label could be applied to and choose to hurt the real person in front of you.   I am ashamed of how I used to behave. That means in 30 more years, I will probably be ashamed of who I am right now. If we are lucky, we will find new ways to be kind and inclusive and welcome the deviations and that means I will look at how I behave now with horror.   That's a good thing. It means we are evolving and growing over time. I can allow myself to be confronted. I can make an effort to learn, apologize and correct as we continue to change. It is both uncomfortable and necessary.    Transgender people have always been here, but they feel new. New means change. Change creates an obligation to evolve and these bitter, brittle people are committed to stagnating and becoming irrelevant. They lack the courage to accept the part they play in what hurts them and so they blame you.",eaudetrash,2025-04-30T03:05:02,7
I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm so sorry. They think they have a right to judge people I guess. üòî It doesn‚Äôt help but I think you / we deserve better,RubArtistic4683,2025-04-30T00:02:04,3
"They don‚Äôt hate you, they love you. You are a very small minority that most people know very little about. They can use that uncertainty to create fear that turbocharges the algorithms to get people angry enough to vote. All those clicks make the tech bros even richer. You are just the poor unlucky ones in the wrong place at the wrong time. But remember, there are lots & lots of us that do not hate you & there are plenty of polls globally that show the vast majority have no hate whatsoever towards you ‚ù§Ô∏è",Angry3042,2025-04-30T07:39:37,1
