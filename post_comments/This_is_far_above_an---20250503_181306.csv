Stop calling it deportation. Deportation happens to foreigners. These are citizens being kidnapped by the State and expelling them elsewhere.,dairyqueen79,2025-05-03T20:48:37,11

"To be fair, he really fumbled the delivery of the line.

"They know their magat base is extremely violent and would absolutely come after them if they didn‚Äôt toe Trump‚Äôs fascist line.
