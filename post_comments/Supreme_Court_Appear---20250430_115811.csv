I wonder what excuse they'll use to oppose Islamic charter schools or a Temple of Satan charter schools while supporting Catholic and Fundamentalist charter schools.,KingKrasnov,2025-04-30T12:04:39,34
"I'm glad the supreme court has the authority to create these religious charter schools.  Oh wait, they don't. That's a problem isn't it?",Actual__Wizard,2025-04-30T12:04:52,16
"So let me get this straight — we’re moving toward letting religious schools get public funding, but DEI initiatives and acknowledging gender identities are being banned because they’re ‘ideological’? How is religion not ideological too? Seems like ‘freedom of belief’ only counts when it aligns with conservative Christian values. Hypocrisy at its finest.",kid-on-the-block,2025-04-30T12:42:53,12
Clear as day there is no more separation of church and state along with no more democracy.,2HDFloppyDisk,2025-04-30T12:18:03,10
"Everyone thinks this is about religious schools. That is a smoke screen and trick to get uneducated people on board.   **This is all about getting the poor and middle class to pay for private schools for the wealthy.** Those schools have numerous ways to deny access to the poor, middle class, and disabled so that all their voucher money is used for ultra wealthy students.",Captain_Aware4503,2025-04-30T12:30:42,13

"States will deny the creation of Islamic or Satanist schools behind a conveniently onerous approval and appeal process, stating the schools do not meet some nebulous academic guidelines. It will get sent to the Supreme Court eventually, where the justices will say the petitioners have no standing.",LiberacesWraith,2025-04-30T12:35:18,6

"But also about getting publicly-funded private Christian schools. Christian nationalist billionaires have been working on this non-stop for decades now.  That wealthy families get a voucher to defray tuition costs is an undeserved perk for them, but largely temporary as their private schools just up their tuition pricing by the voucher amounts.  NPR - [How Education Secretary Betsy DeVos Will Be Remembered](https://www.npr.org/2020/11/19/936225974/the-legacy-of-education-secretary-betsy-devos)  “DeVos used her bully pulpit to champion religious education, push for school choice and help private schools in financial turmoil.”  Mother Jones - [Betsy DeVos Wants to Use America’s Schools to Build ‘God’s Kingdom’](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/betsy-devos-christian-schools-vouchers-charter-education-secretary/)  “DeVos, who is married to Amway scion Dick DeVos (Forbes says his father, Richard, is worth more than $5 billion), was seen as a controversial choice because of the family’s history of heavy spending on right-wing causes—at least $200 million since the 1970s to think tanks, media outlets, political committees, and advocacy groups. And then there’s the DeVoses’ long support of vouchers for private, religious schools; conservative Christian groups like the Foundation for Traditional Values, which has pushed to soften the separation of church and state; and organizations like Michigan’s Mackinac Center for Public Policy, which has championed the privatization of the education system.”  “Asked whether Christian schools should continue to rely on giving—rather than pushing for taxpayer money through vouchers—Betsy DeVos replied, ‘There are not enough philanthropic dollars in America to fund what is currently the need in education…Our desire is to confront the culture in ways that will continue to advance God’s kingdom.’”  “In the mid-’90s, Mackinac leadership suggested a long-term strategy on how to make unpopular voucher policies more palatable for mainstream America. Its then-senior vice president, Joseph Overton, developed what became known as the Overton Window, a theory of how a policy that’s initially considered extreme might over time be normalized through gradual shifts in public opinion. Education policies were placed on a liberal-conservative continuum, with the far left representing ‘Compulsory indoctrination in government schools’ and the far right representing ‘No government schools.’  Charter schools, then, became a Trojan horse for voucher advocates: Once public school supporters got used to the idea of charters, activists would attempt to nudge public opinion closer to supporting tax credits to pay for private schools. In Michigan, Detroit has been at the heart of the charter push, which began when Gov. John Engler signed charter schools into law in 1993. Three years later, then-Detroit Metro Times reporter Curt Guyette showed how the Prince Foundation, as well as the foundation run by Dick DeVos’ parents, funded a carefully orchestrated campaign to label Detroit’s public schools as failing—and pushed for charters and ‘universal educational choice’ as a better alternative. Betsy DeVos has since written about the need to ‘retire’ and ‘replace’ Detroit’s public school system and pressed for expanding charter schools and vouchers.”",Arrmadillo,2025-04-30T12:45:52,7
"As an atheist, I would enroll my kids in a heartbeat. I'd rather them learn reason and logic instead of bigotry and how to obey. My kids go to public school and they still get force fed Christian trash constantly from all the staff. My son got yelled at by his c\*\*t teacher for saying he doesn't believe in god.",nerdrocker89,2025-04-30T18:02:55,4
