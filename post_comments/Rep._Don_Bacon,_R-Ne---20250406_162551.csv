Theatrics until the House votes on it. I'm sorry to be such a cynic but the GOP has lost their credibility to do the right thing,MrIrrelevantsHypeMan,2025-04-06T16:56:48,414
">Seven Republican senators have so far signed on as co-sponsors of a Senate bill that would require the White House to get congressional approval to impose tariffs, with Bacon telling CBS News he’ll introduce a companion bill in the House on Monday.  > With seven Republicans already backing the legislation potentially clawing back Trump’s tariffs, only a few more GOP senators would be needed to give the bill the 60 votes it needs to pass. Bacon acknowledged on CBS on Sunday that he thinks “it will be harder to pass this in the House,” but if the bill were to get a 60-vote majority in the Senate, “they'll put pressure on the House to look at this.” “So it will not pass tomorrow, or maybe in the next couple of weeks, but this will be in the queue that we can use, and it's time that Congress restores its authorities here,” Bacon told CBS about Trump’s tariffs. “The Constitution is clear, the House and the Senate, Congress, has the power of tariffs and taxes, and we gave some of that power to the executive branch, and I think in hindsight, that was a mistake.” It’s still unclear how many House Republicans could throw their support behind Bacon’s bill when he introduces it Monday.",DissentFR,2025-04-06T16:27:39,70

"> **House Republicans should “hold the line” on Trump’s tariffs and not oppose them, Johnson told his colleagues** on a call Sunday, as reported by The Wall Street Journal, **saying they should trust that Trump and his instincts will ultimately improve the economy**, and just give the tariffs “time” to play out. >  > Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., asked for House lawmakers to receive a briefing on the tariffs because **they haven’t been looped in on what the president’s plan is for them**, the Journal and Punchbowl News report, with Johnson reportedly saying he’d speak with Trump and get someone to brief lawmakers.  If that doesn’t tell you that the Republican Party is now a Trump cult, I don’t know what does. The members of his own party have no clue what he’s up to—they’ve not even been given the bare minimum respect as his allies in Congress—and Speaker Johnson, playing the role of lapdog, says, “Trust Trump.”",dmetzcher,2025-04-06T21:02:20,2
