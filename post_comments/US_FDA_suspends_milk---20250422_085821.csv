"Reminder:  >The 2021 budget put forward by Trump on Feb 10—only 11 days after WHO declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern—proposed drastic cuts to funding that could limit preparedness for pandemics in the USA and abroad. Trump proposed a 16% cut in funding to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and a 40% cut in the US contribution to WHO, as well as reductions for programmes such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Medicaid, which provide assistance to US citizens with low income. Although the budget is unlikely to pass the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives, public health professionals and analysts say the Trump administration has weakened institutions necessary to prepare for and prevent the spread of infectious diseases.  https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7270951/   >The Trump administration cut staff by more than two-thirds at a key U.S. public health agency operating inside China, as part of a larger rollback of U.S.-funded health and science experts on the ground there leading up to the coronavirus outbreak, Reuters has learned.  >The CDC’s China headcount has shrunk to around 14 staffers, down from approximately 47 people since President Donald Trump took office in January 2017, the documents show. The four people, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the losses included epidemiologists and other health professionals.  >Separately, the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the global relief program which had a role in helping China monitor and respond to outbreaks, also shut their Beijing offices on Trump’s watch. Before the closures, each office was staffed by a U.S. official. In addition, the U.S. Department of Agriculture(USDA) transferred out of China in 2018 the manager of an animal disease monitoring program.  https://www.reuters.com/article/world/exclusive-us-slashed-cdc-staff-inside-china-prior-to-coronavirus-outbreak-idUSKBN21C3NE/  >There's a glaring hole in President Trump's budget proposal for 2019, global health researchers say. A U.S. program to help other countries beef up their ability to detect pathogens around the world will lose a significant portion of its funding.  >The ambitious program, called Global Health Security Agenda, was launched in early 2014, aiming to set up an early-warning system for infectious diseases across the world.  >After the Ebola outbreak later that year the program was significantly ramped up with an additional $120 million dollars a year to expand the building of disease-detection systems to dozens more developing countries around the world. That ramped-up funding runs out in September 2019. And while Trump is keeping the original program he has not proposed continued funding at the current level.  https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2018/02/12/585119417/trump-proposes-deep-cuts-in-detecting-disease-outbreaks-worldwide",Infamous_Employer_85,2025-04-22T09:04:54,33

">An HHS spokesperson said the laboratory was already set to be decommissioned before the staff cuts and **though proficiency testing would be paused** during the transition to a new laboratory, **dairy product testing will continue**.  Can anyone break that down for me? Maybe someone who works in a relevant filed (manufacturing, quality, etc)?  That statement leads me to believe that the proficiency testing is not how they test the milk, it's how they test *how* they test the milk. Is that right?  So, at least for the time being, the milk will still be tested as before. But, the test to make sure the test is good will no longer be done. The implication being that, over time, testing the milk may become less and less accurate/informative?  Is that it?  P.S.

Do you realize that you are suggesting the testing done to insure the accuracy of the testing of the milk isn't something to be concerned about.  At my work I use a piece of equipment to measure people's eyes, if I stop calibrating that piece of equipment, I effectively do not have a piece of equipment to measure people's eyes in a reliable way.  You are trying to obfuscate the point by saying it isn't technically the tests they are doing away with, they're just doing away with the testing done to insure the tests are accurate.  Sure you are technically correct but functionally you aren't.  The end result will be unreliable tests that will ultimately end up with people dead.",MesmraProspero,2025-04-23T12:24:36,0
"I don't think it's a secret that the FDA has had its funding cut, and that this is a result of those cuts.  You are just choosing to ignore a report on the symptoms of a problem that is already in motion.  This is still not good news.  These fears were not present prior to the administration attacking government regulations.",KitchenRaspberry137,2025-04-22T10:23:00,8

"You realize that your idea of “decent” isn’t the same as everyone else, right?  She was definitely “decent.” And if decency is the thing you care about, well, she was a hell of a lot better than Trump, too, when it comes to decency.   Even if we had a full primary, there good odds that the nominee would support Israel to some degree. Because at the time of the primary the American public was largely supportive of Israel, as they had just been attacked.   Unfortunately, that’s how democracy works. If you want more people to agree with you, you need to raise awareness, lobby, etc, not refuse to participate.  And when you don’t get your preferred candidate, or the stance on your #1 issue, you then have to be strategic and look at the other issues and vote accordingly.  It’s unfortunate, but yes, we get the government we deserve. And that is 2 terms (at least) of Trump and fascist republicans, because the issue you cared about most wasn’t the same issue everyone else cared about so your contingent threw a tantrum and didn’t vote.  Now people are being disappeared, we’re in a constitutional crisis, the WORLD economy is shrinking, climate change will continue unchecked, and more people will suffer and die from a litany of issues that will get worse WHILE not solving the issue you cared about.  Stupid, yes. And here we are.",amanam0ngb0ts,2025-04-22T12:31:37,3

You don't give a shit about marginalized groups.  That's why you were fine with Dems turning into Republicans on immigration and that's why we have Dems turning on trans Americans.  You couldn't even be bothered to give a shit about Gaza being destroyed with our bombs.  Don't pretend you care about anyone else.,Overton_Glazier,2025-04-22T14:54:51,-3
">Even if we had a full primary, there good odds that the nominee would support Israel to some degree. Because at the time of the primary the American public was largely supportive of Israel, as they had just been attacked.   Well, then good luck winning the election.    It's funny how Trump is deporting students and sanctioning universities at the behest of Pro-Israeli groups. And yet here you are talking about how Dems will be pro-Israeli.  Israel just sided with Russia over Ukraine at the UN.  Israel is currently occupying land in Syria and Lebanon and is annexing more of the West Bank and Gaza.  They are openly calling for ethnic cleansing.  Yet here you are talking about Dems will remain pro-Israel.  You don't give a shit about us sliding into fascism, you just want it to be on your terms.",Overton_Glazier,2025-04-22T12:39:05,-1

"Yeah, I don't know where you got the idea that I'm a ""red fascist.""  I am neither conservative, nor a fascist, nor a Trump supporter.  If anything, I take offense when Dems have similar policies to MAGA, such as the support for the indiscriminate killing of innocent civilians.  But that's always been the case, 20 years ago we had people like you supporting the Iraq War and then pretending you cared about people when it came time to vote.  You don't give a shit, if you did, you would be siding with people opposed to our Gaza policy instead of calling them fascists.",Overton_Glazier,2025-04-23T06:57:44,0
