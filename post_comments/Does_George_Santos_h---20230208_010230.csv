"Santos was always an outsider with minimal connection to the Republican political establishment. So he hasn't really lost power so much as he never had it. It's fairly clear that he's not going to build many connections within Congress and his chances of re-election weren't all that great even before all the revelations about his truthfulness.  However, there's an old saying: there's no such thing as bad publicity. The focus put on him by the Democrats is ensuring that he'll probably have a long and fruitful career even after he leaves office. He just hasn't gotten a good enough offer to step away. He might as well continue to collect his paycheck and - more importantly - the tremendous publicity from all the attacks against him.",ViskerRatio,2023-02-11T01:51:20,6
"Wrong. Santos wasn’t an outsider. He first ran in 2020 and had mainstream New York Republican Party support and funding from established GOP donors in his second run in 2022: https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2023/01/09/george-santos-raised-money-from-wealthy-gop-donors-while-lying-about-his-resume.html. His fraud was well-known by the RNC and local party; they simply didn’t care. So to say he’s an outsider isn’t really accurate even if the Party is struggling to figure out how to ignore him now.  >he'll probably have a long and fruitful career even after he leaves office  Visker he is almost certainly going to be charged with campaign finance fraud, possibly as a felon. If he has a ‘long and fruitful’ career after all this that’s more an indictment of the Republican Party and the people their base is willing to elevate than any comment on the Democratic Party (who didn’t actually give him publicity; the exposes on his fraud were published by press outlets like the Long Island local newspaper, NYTimes, and Daily Beast. Democratic Party was actually criticized for NOT publicizing his fraudulent activity during his campaign)  What a strange thing to even say.",blakpepperfish1949,2023-02-11T05:50:46,6
"> So to say he’s an outsider isn’t really accurate even if the Party is struggling to figure out how to ignore him now.  I'd argue your definition of 'outsider' is so narrow as to be meaningless. If I described Bernie Sanders as an 'outsider', no one would blink an eye despite him meeting all your criteria for being a Democratic Party 'insider'.  > Visker he is almost certainly going to be charged with campaign finance fraud, possibly as a felon.  We will have to see. Santos isn't particularly well-liked by anyone, so you're going to see a lot of people hoping he gets his comeuppance. Maybe he will, maybe he won't - I haven't seen much in the way of hard evidence that he's guilty of campaign finance violations.  However, it ultimately doesn't matter. As I pointed out: there's no such thing as bad publicity. Santos is a nationally recognize figure and, if he manages his brand, he'll be able to dine out on that for a long, long time.  In terms of the Democratic Party and press outlets, consider this: why do you and I even know about Santos? I don't live in his district and I suspect you don't either. If you subtract the story about his veracity, its doubtful either of us would even know who he is. Fundamentally, ""lying crook lies his way to a House seat"" is a local story that has somehow become a national one - and because it's a national story, Santos has gained a great deal of brand recognition he ordinarily wouldn't have.",ViskerRatio,2023-02-11T07:34:40,2

">I'd argue your definition of 'outsider' is so narrow as to be meaningless.   [The New York Young Republican Club supported Santos for years.](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/20/santos-far-right-seeking-distance-00078791) Mainstream Republican donors (not small-dollar donors) supported him...for years. He's just another Republican, recruited by the party in New York to run. There's nothing different in his stature in the party between him and Anna Paulina Luna or other freshmen that were elected.   So not sure what point you're trying to make. If you weren't aware of how mainstream Santos was before he won, that's just a minor error.   >I haven't seen much in the way of hard evidence that he's guilty of campaign finance violations  [Clearly you aren't looking hard enough.](https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2023/01/26/watchdogs-say-santos-campaign-spending-looks-like-fraud) Disbursements and disclosures filed for his campaign show pretty clear signs of fraud and other campaign finance violations.  >why do you and I even know about Santos?   Because a local newspaper reported on the discrepancies in his background, which then became a national news story when the New York Times did its own investigation. It wasn't like it was hard to suss out. I think the bigger question here is not why [U.S. public opinion turned on him](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/new-yorkers-arent-the-only-ones-who-really-dislike-george-santos/) (which is obvious), but why the Republican Party abetted him so long and continues to do so. I don't see any push from Party leadership to have him resign. Should the House GOP reward flagrantly corrupt congressmen for notoriety's sake? Hmmmm.   The point still stands that if he's able to 'dine out' on his notoriety after this, that's basically an indictment of the people still supporting him after all the fraud. It's not really the local press' fault for, well, doing their jobs, nor the Democratic Party's fault since they weren't aware of the extent of his fraud in the first place. So it's just a strange tack to take.",blakpepperfish1949,2023-02-11T11:08:07,3
"> The New York Young Republican Club supported Santos for years.  As I pointed out, you're attempting to define the term 'insider' in a way no reasonable person would recognize. Santos did not have any significant connections or clout within the Republican Party. All you're doing is expressing the fact that Santos received the sort of support that every political candidate who receives a party nod would get.  > Clearly you aren't looking hard enough.  Read that article again. There isn't any actual evidence being discussed. Everything in couched in nefarious conspiracy theory-style insinuations.  What that article details is not legitimately legal troubles for Santos. It details how some people really *want* there to be legal troubles for Santos, but they don't actually know of any.  I think you're doing the same thing. You want the story book ending. But this is real world politics and in the real world, the bad guy often just gets a book deal.",ViskerRatio,2023-02-11T12:41:53,2
