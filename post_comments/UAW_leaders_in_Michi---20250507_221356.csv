"I haven’t heard anything else Fain has said about tariffs, but his qualifications of tariff support in this article seem reasonable. Tariffs can be useful when used smartly by smart people to carefully create a specific result. But he even says these ones are crazy and not helpful and focus on the wrong things and that Canada isn’t the problem.   What else has he said to suggest he’s supporting Trump?",ennuiinmotion,2025-05-08T07:54:36,0
"Those ""imbeciles"" were one of the few unions that threw their support behind Harris (she led among UAW members by double digits) and announced their official endorsement in late July.   Maybe you're thinking of the Teamsters who refused to endorse anyone but, polling showed, overwhelmingly supported Trump over Harris (although a lot of local chapters did throw their support behind her)?",Subliminal_Kiddo,2025-05-07T22:27:59,12
"Maybe, yeah.   I'm just shocked how quiet rank and file auto union members have been about opposing tariffs since they of all people understand the super complex cross border auto assembly process that has been surgically tweaked over decades to ensure both countries' auto sectors thrive/survive  That Shawn Fain, also in possession of this knowledge, has sold his soul and come out pro tariffs is super frustrating and he can fuck off  So these guys speaking up now seems really late in the game, when trump's stupid auto tariff shit sandwich has been on the menu for months",ElPlywood,2025-05-08T07:38:01,2
"Teamsters have a much more diverse membership when it comes to industry and public v private sector. They represent roughly 4x the workers that the UAW represents.   Fain is a populist fool who only wields a stick with no carrot to dangle, which is exactly what Trump is doing. He sees tariffs as the answer to a problem that frankly can’t be fixed by tariffs alone. Thankful for his support of Kamala, but he’s a fool, and I’m pretty sure others are starting to catch on.",Zeddo52SD,2025-05-07T22:49:52,2
Was really disappointed in his heel turn. Listened to an interview with him like a year or two ago and thought based on his word choice he might be a socialist or communist. Can't remember the exact wording just my thoughts on his framing/lexicon. Nope.,BothCan8373,2025-05-08T01:12:54,1
"There’s a lot of socialism in him, but he’s mostly just a populist. Keep in mind he’s an electrician by trade, with no formal education in economics or political science, afaik.",Zeddo52SD,2025-05-08T07:04:50,1
