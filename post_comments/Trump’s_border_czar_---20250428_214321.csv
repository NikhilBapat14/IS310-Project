"You might have had a point in the last Trump administration, but we've crossed a line with this one. We had weeks of coverage in the news, and what action did it get from the American people?  If y'all will submit to people getting accidentally deported without due process, and y'all will submit to American citizens getting deported without due process, and y'all will submit to infants with cancer getting deported without due process, more news coverage is not going to fix the problem. It's not like y'all don't know you live under an anti-democratic fascist dictatorship. It's time to stop being Homer Simpson the sanitation engineer whining, ""can't someone else do it?"" You want this fixed, you're going to have to get on your feet and do the work.",PaxDramaticus,2025-04-29T03:45:58,6
