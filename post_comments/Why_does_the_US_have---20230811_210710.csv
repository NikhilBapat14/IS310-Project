"1. Exorbitant healthcare costs, caused by technological and pharmaceutical patents, that make the best treatments only available to the rich.  2. A shortage of nurses, rural doctors and medical specialists, driven by medical associations and the high cost/long duration of medical school.  3. A lack of access to affordable healthy foods (food deserts).  4. Inactivity.  5. Stress.",ArchdukeAlex8,2023-08-21T02:53:36,7
"The life expectancy has many variables, so it's hard to say without the data your looking at.   When people study life expectance, that's all people, all ages. When 20 something year old gang members get killed, that reflects on the country's life expectancy, and has nothing to do with healthcare. But it does add a statistic of a young death. The US has an large number here that other countries don't.   When I looked into Social Security, there is another statistic about life expectancy that says if you live to X then your life expectancy is Y. They do this to help you plan. If you google life expectancy in the US, it shows 80, but if you make it to retirement, your life expectancy is higher than 80.   If you want to associate healthcare systems with life expectancy, you need to remove young deaths not related to healthcare. such as gun violence and car accidents.",other_view12,2023-08-29T15:59:07,3
"Our healthcare industry employs over 23 million people. There are less than 1 million licensed doctors, about 3 million licensed nurses.   The vast majority of our healthcare system is a bureaucratic welfare program",theresourcefulKman,2023-09-12T05:32:36,3
"1: The misinterpretation and politicization of the second amendment, the USA has the most civilian firearms per person in the world and is number nine globally in total death rate of 12/100,000 inhabitants dying annually from firearms.  The top ten countries with the highest death rates are El Salvador, Venezuela, Eswatini, Jamaica, Honduras, Guatemala, Brazil, Colombia, United States, Uruguay.  2: America had been designed around the automobile, cities and towns are mostly not walkable and the fast food, big box grocery stores lead to an over abundance of corn syrup, high fructose refined grains foods, with the most healthy foods only available to those who can afford them in usually high priced stores.   3: Healthcare for some reason is tied to your employer, so changing jobs, losing a job or retiring affects your level of care and makes it for many too costly to keep up and so they avoid going to the doctor and only go when it’s an emergency, so only the rich, politicians or super lucky get the best care.",[deleted],2023-09-03T13:12:54,2

"I just read the other day Americans spend around 10% of their income on healthcare. Compared to about 4% in the UK. If course they didn’t say how they cane to this conclusion or who. My first thought was they’re looking at the average taken from paychecks vs. the tax percentage taken in the UK.  Which if thats the case, its because many of those policies cover multiple people.",pinealprime,2023-10-18T16:07:45,2
"The USA kind of has a perfect storm to be the worst of the industrialized nations for life expectancy, honestly.   To add to what's already been said - when talking about 'unhealthy lifestyles,' part of the issue is also central to our country due to gov't regulations (or lack thereof) rather than culturally based decisions, and some of these also spur the issue with health.  Many, MANY people in the USA are obese, but for a lot of folks, there are factors contributing to this.  For example, In the USA, 'healthy' food is more expensive than many varieties of high calorie or high sugar food. Until one reaches a certain level of financial security, you buy food that has enough calories to keep you going. It's only once you have enough financial security that you can try to prioritize other nutrients, and in the USA, that means you get cheap, 'bad' food that has the calories to keep you going. And this contributes to growing health problems - processed foods are suspected to make it more likely to develop auto-immune diseases, for example.   Japan, it's easy to find cheap but healthier food, even just in am/pm corner store type places. (as an example, USA am/pm often have hotdogs, nachos, etc.... Japan also has am/pm, and they'll have things like rice balls and tuna). They have more regulations and laws in place that contribute to staying healthy, whereas the USA...not so much.   The USA also seems to follow a policy on food and health safety that is close to 'if it harms a lot of people, but not ALL people, then it would be harmful to companies if we banned/limited this thing.' Seems like in Europe it is more 'if it harms some people, but not ALL people, it would be harmful to people so we'll ban/limit this thing.'  Artificial dyes are a good example to this.  What this means, healthwise, is that the groups of people who can be harmed more by certain chemicals, pollutants, ingredients in our foods (often more present in the cheaper, more calorie dense foods) are getting sicker in the USA when they aren't in more regulated places. Auto-immune diseases also pop up here, too.   The USA also does not have socialized healthcare, which means poorer outcomes for pregnant women and their infants due to lack of care.   And now we have abortion issues in many states which is impacting outcomes for even more pregnant women than ever (we already had rising maternal mortality rate before the abortion regulations changes).   The USA has very poor disability welfare, which is hitting us harder than normal because of the rising number of long term disabilities from long covid.   And on top of that, based on current research, covid seems to worsen auto-immune disorders that are already present, and make it more likely for them to trigger, if not present.  Pre-covid, unsurprisingly, the USA had (best I can tell from the  statistics) the higher % of auto-immune disorders diagnosed among industrialized nations. That's with us having worse healthcare, which takes more money for folks to get diagnosed, which means our #'s are likely much higher. So add on covid's impact on auto-immune disorders, our regulations that determine our exposure to substances that may impact auto-immune disorders, covid's impact on our population add to that, AND the regulations for our workers that make it harder to take time off to avoid spreading diseases or get care when one has diseases, including chronic ones?  Yeah, makes sense that we have lower life expectancy, and that we spend so much on healthcare with less result, even IF we had more normalized costs for it.",shaunamom,2024-04-30T15:33:10,2
Yet if you compare the actual quality of care American healthcare is much better than these other countries for example in canada sure it’s “free” but it takes hours to see a specialist and is overall pretty bad.,OldReputation865,2024-03-28T02:48:48,1

"Well, GDP isn’t real and we obviously don’t spend the money wisely.   Plus, a lot more underlying health issues and an over reliance on meds means avoidance of behavior change. Lower quality of food, more chemicals, and lower walkability of neighborhoods doesn’t help. Also, more murders and vehicular deaths.   I can’t prove the last point but I find the USA a lot more stressful than Europe. Less safety and less vacation. In my area people are very superficial and move in/out a lot, and are 1+ hours of traffic jam away, so it’s harder to maintain connections, That can’t increase your life expectancy.",clipboarder,2023-09-17T10:01:49,1
"Diet is a big factor, too. A lot of people around here think that eating nutritious foods and avoiding eating much junk is utter quackery.

it has nothing to do with healthcare. It has everything to do with Black on black crime which kills people in their teens and 20s which crushes the average life expectancy numbers.   This is totally misleading yet pushed by Euro news sources because they want eveyrone to believe US healthcare is inferior to socialized medicine and its' not.,jankology,2023-11-23T20:10:47,1

"Cost is not a good indicator for the US. The HC system is opaque, inefficient and a rip-off. Pharma companies charge a multiple of a drug price in the US vs any other equivalently wealthy or developed European country. Why the US society accepts it is beyond me. The injustice is so outrageous that I would expect it to overcome the very significant lobbyism spendings.",missusmissisppi,2023-12-16T05:39:45,1

">Exorbitant healthcare costs, caused by technological and pharmaceutical patents, that make the best treatments only available to the rich.  Not entirely accurate.  The vast majority of medical technologies and pharmaceuticals the US has are available worldwide, especially in western Europe.    You also forgot to add the US health insurance - medical provider game where one artificially raises the price to compensate for the other bargaining the price down.  Final item you did not mention - greed.  For profit medical care always results in the patient getting screwed.  Even ""non-profit"" is driven in many ways by profit, which once again means the patient gets screwed.",toad__warrior,2023-08-24T07:23:00,2
   Good list but I would add eating  insane amounts of unhealthy processed foods even where there aren't food deserts. Like entire bags of potato chips (80 grams of fat 800 calories) after dinner while watching TV.,_flying_otter_,2024-01-30T06:08:45,1

"Oh man. Hours to see a specialist? How do I get into Canada?!  I broke my ankle here in the states, and it took me three weeks to get an appointment to see an orthopedic surgeon. By that time the bone was mostly healed. Luckily it was a minor fracture that didn’t require surgery, but I have had friends that had a similar wait, the bone healed wrong, and then they had to have surgery to correct it. We have waits to see specialists here in the states too buddy.   Also, if you compare the actual quality of care, American health care is not much better. Take child mortality, the US ranks 33 out of 37 countries with a rate of 6.3. [what about maternal death rate](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1240400/maternal-mortality-rates-worldwide-by-country/), where again the us ranks pretty high. Only Costa Rica, Columbia, and Mexico tank higher.    I can go on all day, it’s all just a google away, but you compare any measure of healthcare and healthcare outcomes (ie not dieing) the US ranks pretty poorly.",SkirtFamous1716,2024-03-28T07:51:42,1
