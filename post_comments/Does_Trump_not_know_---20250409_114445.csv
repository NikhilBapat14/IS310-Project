I believe he knows they are a tax on Americans but lies about it to sell it.   But I do think he genuinely thinks tariffs are good and trade deficits are bad.,MonarchLawyer,2025-04-09T15:33:12,186
He knows how market manipulation works and he knows how to leverage the Oval Office.,GuestCartographer,2025-04-09T15:39:13,126
"So it's really hard to pin down exactly what he believes.  His stated goals are sometimes in conflict with each other and his actions are unpredictable and often not what one would do if they were looking for permanent legislative change.  For example, one stated goal of the tariffs is to bring manufacturing back to the US.  But we also keep being told it's a negotiation tactic and he wants other countries to come to him and make a deal.  And that they have something to do with fentanyl.  But no US company is going to spend years setting up manufacturing operations and training employees in the US, where labor is much more expensive if Trump's willing to make a deal to end the tariffs that are the entire reason they're doing that at any time.  There's no assurance the investment won't blow up in their face.  The best I can understand his mindset is that Trump, in all his dealings as a businessman, president, and in personal relationships, does not believe in the concept of a win-win.  Every deal and interaction has a winner and a loser.  There's always a sucker.  If he hires a company to build a property, he doesn't come out the winner if he get a new building and they get paid their agreed upon price.  If he gets his new property, then tells them ""I'll pay you half or you can spend years and all your resources suing me and they acquiesce, then he's the winner and they're the loser.  On trade, he believes the US is the sucker when it should be calling all the shots because we're the biggest and the strongest.  Trade deficits aren't automatically bad.  There's countries that make stuff we buy, but don't really buy anything from us because they're poor or very few people live there or whatever.  But in Trump's mind, having a trade deficit with another country makes the US the loser no matter what the reason.  This seems to be why we got the bizarre formula they used to calculate the tariffs.  So yes, Trump knows that a tariff is paid by US consumers.  It's not that he doesn't understand what they are and how they work.  He just has a very singular and simplistic idea of how he can use them to reshape the world economy.",freedraw,2025-04-09T19:24:22,16

"Trump exists in a world beyond what normal humans would calling ""lying."" It's not that he's saying things he knows to be false. It's that he's saying things without regard to whether they're true. He says whatever he needs to say to get what he wants at any given moment and simply doesn't care if it's true or false.  It's also vanishingly likely this has anything to do with trade or economics at all. [Jamelle Bouie wrote an op-ed in NYT yesterday](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/opinion/trump-tariffs-rationale-power.html?unlocked_article_code=1.-k4.nnS0.BqKX7NSXY3vZ&smid=url-share) explaining—correctly, I think—that Trump's actions are all explainable only in terms of his pathological need to dominate others:  >The fundamental truth of Donald Trump is that he apparently cannot conceive of any relationship between individuals, peoples or states as anything other than a status game, a competition for dominance. His long history of scams and hostile litigation — not to mention his frequent refusal to pay contractors, lawyers, brokers and other people who were working for him — is evidence enough of the reality that a deal with Trump is less an agreement between equals than an opportunity for Trump to abuse and exploit the other party for his own benefit. For Trump, there is no such thing as a mutually beneficial relationship or a positive-sum outcome. In every interaction, no matter how trivial or insignificant, someone has to win, and someone has to lose. And Trump, as we all know, is a winner.   >  > This simple fact of the president’s psychology does more to explain his antipathy to international trade and enthusiasm for tariffs and other trade barriers than any theorizing about his intentions or overall vision. It certainly is not as if he has a considered view of the global economy. It is not even clear that Trump knows what a tariff is.  Because of Trump's recklessness with truth, it's hard to know what he actually knows or doesn't know. When he came down the gold escalator in 2015 and said ""Mexico"" was ""sending"" immigrants to the U.S., did he mean that as a synecdoche? Or did he honestly believe officials within the Mexican government were themselves selecting Mexican citizens to be transported into the U.S.? Who knows? (Given his *L'État, c'est moi* attitude toward governance, he may honestly believe so, because that's what he would do.)  Does he really think the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him due to massive, yet unprovable, fraud? Hard to tell—but he *needs* that to do be the case, because his incredibly fragile ego can't tolerate the notion that he lost something, fair and square. If he wins, it's because he succeeded on his own merits, with his own facilities and without anyone's help. If he loses, it's because someone cheated him out of the inevitable victory which is necessarily and always rightly his. (Or it was someone else's fault.)  So asking ""is he lying?"" is the wrong question, because for Trump, there is no ""true"" or ""false.""",Leopold_Darkworth,2025-04-10T12:42:33,5

"I don’t think it’s fair to say Trump doesn’t understand how tariffs work—or that he’s just blindly pushing them without a strategy. The ‘China pays’ line might be oversimplified for messaging, sure, but the core idea isn’t that he’s clueless. It’s about using America’s economic weight to shift the playing field. And I’d argue the left gets this just as twisted sometimes, not the right.  Take an example: a $100 good with a 20% tariff doesn’t automatically mean Americans pay $120. That’s not how markets work. Companies don’t just slap the full tariff on the price tag and call it a day—competition and demand decide that. If they try to charge $120 and there’s a cheaper option from, say, Vietnam or even a domestic producer, they’re stuck. They’ll either eat part of that $20 hit to stay competitive, or they’ll lose market share. So yeah, maybe the price creeps up to $105 or $110, but the company’s profit shrinks too—say, from $100 to $80 after the tariff, with the other $20 going to the U.S. government. That’s not a tax on Americans; it’s a cost foreign producers have to wrestle with.  The U.S. market is the biggest in the world—nobody else even comes close. That’s why this can work. Other countries rely on selling to us way more than we rely on any one of them. When Trump (or anyone) pushes tariffs, it’s not about charity—it’s leverage to force better trade deals or bring production closer to home. People act like he’s the only one who’s ever thought of this, but go Google Nancy Pelosi or Bernie Sanders railing about the U.S.-China trade deficit in Congress. They’ve both floated tariffs as a fix too! The difference is Trump’s actually doing it.  So, is he clueless or just selling it? Neither, really. He’s betting on America’s consumption power to make other countries blink first. The left cries ‘tax on Americans,’ but they miss how market dynamics and U.S. dominance shift the burden. Prices might nudge up a bit, but the bigger hit’s on foreign profits—and the bigger win’s in long-term trade balance. It’s not rocket science; it’s just messy, and people love oversimplifying it.",Ordinary-Control8640,2025-04-10T01:24:31,1
"Well you are correct, the cost is usually passed down to the consumer. But that is the producers doing. We, you, are not being forced to keep buying those products. The best, and probably only, way that companies will keep prices down, is if their products stop selling. Get it?  One of the core principles of progressive thinking is that corporate greed using slave labor of impoverished countries is evil, isn't it? Well, why keep supporting that slave labor by continuing to buy products from those countries that are being tariffed? Hmmm.  I just read some stupid article about how much an iPhone is going to cost now because of those evil tariffs. I think it said 400 or 500 dollars now.  Those phones are still being produced at the whooping cost of maybe 50 dollars. And that's being generous.",One_Recognition_4001,2025-04-10T02:39:33,1
The good faith answer is pro tariff people want domestic products to be way cheaper than foreign products at the store. In theory the economic boost to US industry created by more domestic demand for US products makes  up for some products being more expensive. This ofc can be a problem if it's products that aren't produced at quantity domestically or if consumers are used to say shirts costing $5 instead of $30 but there's no way to produce cheap shirts with your cost of labor. It also assumes there will be no reaction in other countries.,Dr_thri11,2025-04-10T02:48:07,1
"Trump knows quite well that the tariffs are actually a consumption tax. He has stated he wants to eliminate the income tax and shift to tariffs.

"Sometimes not every bit of the tariff is passed on to the consumer. It’s a hard thing to measure. We’ll have to see exactly how much gets passed on, how much the prices of Chinese imports increase the next few months.  Consider it this way, if you were a Chinese exporter, then you probably want to sell to the Americans because that’s where you make the most profit. If they put tariffs on, paid by the importer, then that importer won’t be able to sell as many of the product at the higher price, so they’ll buy less from you, the exporter. You then would have to sell more to other countries, who pay less than the Americans do. Or you could lower your prices slightly, let’s say 5-10%, to save yourself the trouble of selling to other countries who pay less anyway. The importer and the retailer might absorb like 5-10% of the cost as well, it depends. They still want to move a high volume. There are other middlemen entities too.

"Trump went about it the wrong way and his bluster just makes things worse.  However, does Trump have a point when he talks about tariffs that other countries level on the USA as well as 3rd countries?  Many of you  may find Trump’s tariffs distasteful, but they have to be viewed in the context of what is already a highly illiberal global trading order.  Tariffs have long been a tool in the arsenal of advanced countries and remain so today.  Other countries, including rising power India, levy tariffs of 70 to 100 per cent on electric vehicles (EVs) from China and elsewhere.  Europe, which screams the most about tariffs, has been reluctant to reduce its historically high protective barriers on quite a few American products.  Canada, a beneficiary of an almost $100 billion trade surplus with the US last year, has also been very protectionist for a long time.  Canada recently levied an 100 per cent tariff on imported Chinese EVs and a 25 per cent surtax on Chinese steel and aluminium.

China will take a hit but their economy will handle it and the CCP is very good at suppressing dissent, we saw this during the covid pandemic.

"See the tariffs I think serve a purpose in CONCEPT. Get manufacturers to come back to the states with better trade deals using the tariffs as the stick the US is swinging.

So the potential positive effect of having companies come back and manufacture inside the US is great but it's friggin YEARS out before the stuff can actually be made.

Tariffs are always paid by the importer, which in the end means they are always paid by the consumer.  It can lead to people buying less of a product if there's a replacement.

Their price automatically goes to $150 if nothing changes and they pass 100% of the tariff onto the consumer. Now the US company can compete at the $130 price point unless Company A slashes their prices to compensate for a portion of the tariff.  It's not a bad long term goal to bring manufacturing jobs back but at the end of the day the market will decide the price but I'd imagine no matter what prices are going to be higher in general either from more expensive stuff made in the US (ignoring quality or whatever product differences) or from the imported stuff with a tariff pinned to it.

Both of your parties are on the right side of the spectrum: What you call libs don't even have real representation:  You're merely applying it to everyone who disagrees with you in such an obvious way that it makes whatever point you were trying to regurgitate lose all value. And it trivializes the term itself: You've ensured it'll never, ever mean anything more than  ""someone who disagrees with you.""  It took you 4 days to come up with a short ""i hate liberals"" rant. You really like to reduce everything to your raging hard on for Trump. It's not even politics.  It's a fan club.",D4rkstorn,2025-04-29T05:03:40,1
