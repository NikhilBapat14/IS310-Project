"Trump is claiming that moving from tariffs to taxes are what led to the Great Depression.  He wants to take us back to pre-WWI.  Seriously, he thinks this is going to work out and that he will go down in history as the greatest President of all time.  But, apparently no one told him that life is far more complicated these days and we are now a fully connected and global economy.",crucial_geek,2025-04-02T18:15:19,41

Why wouldn't we have a trade deficit with small countries?  We have 26% of the world's gdp despite being 5% of the world's population. Our place in the world has helped out our economy tremendously. We arent the worlds suckers,Antique-Egg,2025-04-02T18:28:58,3

Trump has some level of intelligence. He sees the stock market going down. It‚Äôs intentional. Whether that‚Äôs because he‚Äôs getting his buddies to buy low or to tank America because Daddy Putin said so it‚Äôs unclear.,Joshhwwaaaaaa,2025-04-02T21:06:01,-1

"I don't think that he gets that the rest of the world will keep on freely trading with each other as usual, and some countries may surpass the U.S. in GDP.   Or that companies may start to invest elsewhere.  A part of his game seems to be to get foreign business to invest and build in the U.S., but this could backfire.  It is also a possibility that U.S. companies move to do more business in other countries.  GM and Ford could just start shipping more vehicles directly from Mexico, Brazil, China, or Eastern Europe to the rest of the world as examples.  This would bypass U.S. export penalties and other U.S. centric cost spikes and would be less of a political headache.   So, even though they may still be headquartered in Detroit, they can move production, profit, and maybe even R&D outside of the U.S.  I am not saying that this exact scenario would play out, but these countries, just like Trump and Musk, really do only care about their bottom lines and participating in the global economy is what they do.  3M, Honeywell, Boeing, Raytheon, Target, Exxon, and on and on are players on the global market.  Fuck, even Musk relies on the global economy.",crucial_geek,2025-04-02T21:39:56,3
