"*From Bloomberg News reporter Greg Stohr:*  Granting an emergency request by Trump on a 5-4 vote, the justices tossed out a lower court order that had paused deportations under the Alien Enemies Act while litigation continues.   The majority said detainees must have an “opportunity” to be heard by a judge before deportations take place.

"Lol uh no, they are not invaders "" by definition "". They didn't arrive as an intrusive force intent on occupying or subjugating America. You probably never even knew these guys existed before their arrests.  And they are certainly not a terrorist organization. You, nor I, have ever seen any of these guys using violence against civilians in an effort to spread their political or religious idealogy. They're gangsters, allegedly. And while they may be scum, no man should be sentenced without being proven to be guilty first.  They may be criminals. They may be here illegally. If they are, then I have no problem with Trump deporting them. But do it the right way, not the easy way. His current methods landed an innocent, court order-protected man in prison. This is why due process exists.   It's amazing, the people who defend these blatant violations of the constitution. Somehow, you work it out in your head that it's all good because it's your side that's doing it. Any power Trump accumulates thru the presidency will pass onto the next president, then the next and the next. And they may not be your party, but they will have the power and precedent to carry out the same fucked up methods. What happens when an angry Democrat wins and goes after the MAGAs?

"terrorism is also defined as committing crimes and violence in the name of politics (probably worded that wrong cuz i just font stoned). j6 was an unorganized protest that got out of hand. it only vaguely fits the description.   TDA was defined as a terrorist organization because there’s evidence they were sent here by the venezuelan government. whether you or i believe it (i do) those guys sent to el salvador were violent criminals and members of that gang and others (being in a gang is a crime). they needed to be scooped up because the longer they were on the streets the more potentially violent crimes they could commit. trump said from the start he wanted to get the most violent guys out and he’s doing that.   if they were arrested they would be put into notoriously lenient criminal system which a lot have probably been cycled though before.   that’s what’s happening and if/when it goes further we’ll deal with it legally.     again, i’m high so forgive any grammar.",callmestinkingwind,2025-04-07T20:52:19,1

"Whatevs.  If you don't care about checks or balances or the rule of law, you're a little goosestepper.    If you're okay with people being shipped to prisons without proof of guilt you're *definitely* a little goosestepper.  There's roughly seventy million of you.  It's okay to admit it, little goosestepper.",InertiasCreep,2025-04-07T21:02:49,1

Supporting fascism is the best way to prove you're fascist.,InertiasCreep,2025-04-07T21:04:19,1
everything that was done was done legality and the court says so. i thought you believed in the rule of law?,callmestinkingwind,2025-04-07T21:04:58,1
No it wasn't.  The court ordered the victim to be returned to the US and the administration appealed.  That's how fascism works.  Checks and balances on the executive are removed.  It's been done before.,InertiasCreep,2025-04-07T21:06:33,1
isn’t what they’re doing part of the legal process?,callmestinkingwind,2025-04-07T21:07:12,1
Shipping those people overseas to a foreign prison wasn't.  The problem starts there.  EDIT: Shippong them with zero proof of crimes committed or evidence of gang membership.  Forgot that.,InertiasCreep,2025-04-07T21:08:23,1
but they did it and the court says it’s all good. how you feel about that doesn’t really matter. just like when they were allowed here illegally and myself and most of the country felt it was wrong,callmestinkingwind,2025-04-07T21:09:32,1

calling everyone you disagree with a fascist/racist/homophobe etc is a proven way to lose an election btw,callmestinkingwind,2025-04-07T21:22:59,1
"You agree with fascism.  Like I said, so do seventy million other people who voted for it.  This whole OMG HOW DARE YOU CALL ME FASCIST is beyond unnecessary.  Keep enjoying being fascist.",InertiasCreep,2025-04-07T21:25:59,1

I'm not doing it to insult you.  I'm just pointing it out.  You have repeatedly endorsed fascist policies in this thread.  Ive said - several times now - seventy million other people agree with you.  Why is pointing it out such a problem for you?,InertiasCreep,2025-04-07T21:31:58,1

"Okay, I don't understand it at all.  I have no idea what it is.  I am absolutely and completely mistaken.  Any parellels is see with contemporary events and the history of Nazi Germany or Fascist Italy are completely mistaken.  The blaming of society's problems on scapegoats (foreigners, Democrats, people with alternative sexualities), the gradual erosion of civil liberties, the use of mob violence to suppress checks and balances, the use of law enforcement to stifle dissent, the partnership between governmwnt and the economic ologarchy.  All of it lies solely in my overworked imagination.  You are a patriot who wants to make America Great Again, by getting rid of the foreigners who poison the blood of our society.
