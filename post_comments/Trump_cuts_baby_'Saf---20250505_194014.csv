"States very rarely can, and it is 100% due to difficulties in raising taxes at the State level. Research is fucking expensive, which means you need a very high tax base in order to fund it.

"Not sure if you are being serious or not. What evidence do you have?   The Hep B vaccine was VERY successful at reducing SIDS.  > At the time of introduction of the hepatitis B vaccine for routine use in all infants, about 5,000 children died every year from SIDS. Within 10 years of the introduction of the hepatitis B vaccine the use of the vaccine increased to about 90 percent of all infants and the incidence of SIDS in that group decreased dramatically to about 1,600 cases each year.  As far as the within 24 hours of a vaccine, the rate of infants dying in the first year was the same for both kids vaccinated and unvaccinated. So the vaccines were not the cause but coincidentally and statistically predictably.  > However, since immunizations are given to about 90 percent of children less than 1 year of age, and about 1,600 cases of SIDS occur every year, it would be expected, statistically, that every year about 50 cases of SIDS will occur within 24 hours of receipt of a vaccine. However, because the incidence of SIDS is the same in children who do or do not receive vaccines, we know that SIDS is not caused by vaccines.  https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccines-and-other-conditions/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-sids",leaonas,2025-05-07T14:49:38,1
