"Here is the thing:   Trump never knew how to run a business, he never knew how to govern a country, he never knew how to be a father/parent, and so on.   Everything he’s touched has gone to shit.   His followers refuse to read his history (most of them don’t know how to read or comprehend text).   Others believed that things would turn around with him and got conned.   GOP is backing him (most of them)   Dems need to stop taking and start doing more!   Now all of us are fucked.   Every day he’s in the office, he proving us right that he can’t do shit if his orange miserable life depended on it!",monsterdiv,2025-04-03T18:41:01,14
Damn Americans are bad at math. It's a tax. Taxes make things more expensive. duh.,jawshoeaw,2025-04-03T19:21:19,4
"CNN article:  >**[Every car is about to get more expensive. ‘It’s just math,’ former Ford CEO says](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/03/business/car-prices-tariffs-trump/index.html)**  >“The cost of vehicles will go up. It’s just math. The bottom line is there is absolutely no vehicle that won’t be impacted by tariffs,” Fields told CNN in a phone interview.   >Trump’s 25% tariff on imported cars kicked in on Thursday as part of the president’s bid to revive American manufacturing jobs. The administration plans to slap tariffs on car parts by May 3. Bank of America estimates that a 25% tariff on all imported auto parts would increase the cost of US assembled vehicles by about $26 billion — or around $3,285 per vehicle on average.   >Even cars assembled at US factories will likely get more expensive because they use many foreign parts. Goldman Sachs estimates **the cost of foreign-made cars will increase by between $5,000 and $15,000 per vehicle due to tariffs.**",progress18,2025-04-03T18:22:52,1

"NBC and Mark Burnett have a LOT to answer for...running that idiot show for 10 years, implanting the idea that tRump was a business genius; not just in the viewers' head, but in his own!",Spirit50Lake,2025-04-03T18:52:52,7
Trump managed to bankrupt a casino.  He’s not any good at business.,tc100292,2025-04-03T18:53:55,3
Trump knows to listen to whomever gives him money and gargle his balls,supercali45,2025-04-03T20:19:17,2
"I totally agree, however I don't think that Mark Burnett or NBC had any clue that Trump would actually attempt to run for president, and then completely destroy the country. I mean, Trump may have talked about it while on ""The Apprentice"" but they likely never took him seriously.   They ARE responsible for dusting off that old relic though, when there is a very strong chance had they just left it alone, he would have been long forgotten by now, and only remembered as some grotesque and bombastic pop culture figure from the 1980s",LivingIndependence,2025-04-03T20:12:28,5
