The US has got a BIG leopard problem lately.,poopey_doopey_Sr,2025-04-25T15:58:27,639
"**From reporter Nathalie Baptiste:**  Last month, 14 tornadoes struck Arkansas over the course of two days, killing three people and leaving 32 more injured. The deadly outbreak damaged or destroyed 500 homes, cars and businesses, leaving behind more than $8.8 million of storm damage.  As is customary, Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders asked the federal government for help. After a major disaster, the usual procedure is for the federal government to issue a disaster declaration, setting the wheels in motion for the Federal Emergency Management Administration to step in with funds to help the state clean up.  But President Donald Trump said no. In a letter from April 11, the federal government said it had “determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies.”  Arkansas was on its own.  Since his return to power, Trump has been on a rampage, cutting federal funds, firing government employees and threatening his enemies with political retribution. The federal government, his thinking seems to be, is no longer there to provide services to Americans, but rather a weapon to use against any person or institution that dares to question his policies.  Here's a link to the full article: [https://www.huffpost.com/entry/arkansas-tornados-trump-fema-help\_n\_680bd3c2e4b0f42cc7ebde87?utm\_medium=Social&utm\_source=reddit&utm\_campaign=us\_main](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/arkansas-tornados-trump-fema-help_n_680bd3c2e4b0f42cc7ebde87?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=us_main)",huffpost,2025-04-25T15:57:04,165

In this view, the government is overrun with radical leftists doling out checks to undeserving liberals in the form of government assistance and fat paychecks for lazy bureaucrats.”  Arkansas in 2023: “President Biden, we need FEMA funds!”  Biden, within 48 hours of the request: “Here you go.”  Arkansas in May 2024 - “President Biden, we need FEMA funds again!”  Biden: “Here you go.”   “So, when tornadoes hit Arkansas, a state that voted for Trump three times, with the last election being the highest margin for a GOP candidate since 1972, and whose governor was his former press secretary, residents perhaps didn’t think FEMA denials would apply to them.”  Arkansas in 2025: “President Trump, we need FEMA funds!”  Trump: “Nah, take care of it yourselves.”  Dear MAGA, please tell us more about how “radical leftists” are only  “doling out checks to undeserving liberals in the form of government assistance.”",stunneddisbelief,2025-04-25T19:04:28,31
