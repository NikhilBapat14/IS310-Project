This is disturbing but as a retired RN I’m not surprised. So many negative after effects from brain injury are only seen by the family and those closest to the affected person. It rings true to me reading it. I don’t think this is a case of disgruntled staffers. It’s tragic. I donated money and voted for him.

Harris's campaign failed to energize a largely debt-burdened population struggling to get by in a post-COVID landscape. And when she said things like ""I wouldn't change a thing"" when it comes to policy it left the impression that it would just be more of the same Biden-esque centrism and incrementalism.  Walz was like a breath of fresh air. Incredibly popular and down-to-earth, with a record of strong advocacy for workers and the lower/middle class.

"He strongly implied it, or did massive chunks of the electorate have mass psychosis? He clearly indicated he would be a transitional president.  From the Hill   “Biden’s top advisers and prominent Democrats outside the Biden campaign have recently revived a long-running debate whether Biden should publicly pledge to serve only one term, with Biden himself signaling to aides that he would serve only a single term,” reported Ryan Lizza. “While the option of making a public pledge remains available, Biden has for now settled on an alternative strategy: quietly indicating that he will almost certainly not run for a second term while declining to make a promise that he and his advisers fear could turn him into a lame duck and sap him of his political capital",bungpeice,2025-05-02T14:00:30,-2

"> ""Plenty of people"" tying performance to a stroke is not ""evidence.""  If a doctor says “watch out for these things”, and then those things happen according to the people the doctor told that to, and those people felt concerned enough to tell that doctor, I consider it enough evidence to be concerned myself. Especially when this is about one of the most powerful positions in the world and this behavior directly impacts other people.  > Plenty of people with no stroke history have changed their tune once elected.  Yes, and plenty of people who have had strokes undergo a sudden change in personality and behaviors that are worth exploring.   > But I disagree with anyone who says that being ""erratic"" is an automatic disqualifier from political office.    No one has said this here.  > If this article didn't run on rumor, insinuations, and assumptions, what would it look like?

"> Worth exploring by whom?  Are you conducting research into the effects of Traumatic Brain Injury?  No, just a concerned citizen that thinks if people close to someone who had traumatic brain injury begin seeing signs of concern that a doctor told them to watch out for, and that person has a lot of power as an elected official, it’s fair as voters to expect more transparency and accountability. It should be checked out by experts. No one said erratic behavior on its own is automatically disqualifying.  > And If you can't answer the question about how this article would look if it stuck to only facts  You should really try harder to make sure you’re responding to what the other person actually said and not what you imagine they’re saying.   I’m asking you to be specific about your expectations for evidence, because you’ve only criticized what you don’t like but haven’t said what you want to see. If you want a doctor’s firsthand testimony for example you would only get that if Fetterman consented to some examination but he seems to think he’s fine. That means people need to go public to pressure him into it. You’re asking for evidence that can’t yet be acquired, which is why I’m asking you about your expectations for evidence.",Prior_Coyote_4376,2025-05-02T17:36:36,3

"Being a ""concerned citizen"" is not a reason to seek to violate medical privacy IMO. Public officials are not forced to reveal their medical records, *nor should they be.*  That's the point. I'm not giving you ""examples"" of evidence because I am not interested in hearing Fetterman's medical records.  What I am interested in is his performance.  Is Fetterman incapable of performing his job? If so, please provide concrete evidence of times he has failed to *perform his job.*  If you cannot, then neither I nor anyone else is under any obligation to listen to unfounded rumors about his personality changes or degree of assholeness.     ETA: I love how people don't have a response when I suggest focusing on job performance. This suggests that \[you\] people are more invested in Fetterman's *disability* than his *responsibilities.*    Fetterman has been chronically absent from the Senate and [routinely misses votes](https://www.pennlive.com/news/2025/02/report-shows-fetterman-has-missed-the-most-senate-votes-so-far-this-year.html). He has voted against his own party's platform repeatedly.   These are easy issues to focus on, but everyone would rather focus on whether they can blame the stroke.",Gleemonex4Pets,2025-05-02T17:50:08,-1
