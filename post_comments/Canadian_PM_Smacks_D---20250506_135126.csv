Can’t we just set up like a fake Oval Office and let him pretend all of the stupid crap he wants to do is happening?,jgasbarro,2025-05-06T13:54:18,1
"As a Canadian, the fact that this conversation even had to be had is beyond insulting.  Never mind all the rhetoric, Trump is unimaginably classless and doesn't have enough proper decorum to judge a wet-T-shirt contest, yet alone hold public office.  The man has the self-awareness of a two-year-old.",Far-Effective-4159,2025-05-06T14:54:41,1
"Fuck Trump and fuck the USA. No Canadian would ever want to join that Nazi infested, third world shit hole.",Dapper_Raptor_,2025-05-06T14:04:00,1
this was such a disrespectful and embarrassing meeting especially at the end where Trump spouted his made up 200b bs and rantings about not wanting anything from Canada then didnt even give the PM a chance to respond,Lunchb0xx87,2025-05-06T13:54:48,1
"Trump looked like such a beaten down old loser in that meeting. He knew he was beat the whole time, he looked so weak",nasalevelstuff,2025-05-06T15:09:46,1
Trump can you please go play with your blow up doll wife and retire now.  We don't want you. Thanks ,arilupe,2025-05-06T13:52:54,1
Would be really tough to be a world leader that has to sit down with trump in front of rolling cameras. You have to sit there and pretend that you're not dealing with someone with the mental faculties of a 10 year old. It would be so incredibly difficult to not laugh in trump's face when he goes off on one of his incoherent bitch-and-moan tirades about Biden.,LW_GLAZER,2025-05-06T14:10:06,1
Trump is oblivious— except to what he wants. He cannot fathom that Canadians wouldn’t like what he thinks they should like. Don’t give Trump credit for what doesn’t exist— an IQ of any significance.,Humbuhg,2025-05-06T13:57:42,1
I liked how he got Trump to agree that White House and Buckingham Palace not for sale.... 40 million owners said Canada not for sale... ever!  Elbows up!,Mthatcherisa10,2025-05-06T14:45:08,1
Trump will build the wall and Mexico will pay for it before he buys Canada.,cdistefa,2025-05-06T13:56:52,1

For sale??? Who ever said anything about “buying?” Trump just wants to take it.,mouthygoddess,2025-05-06T14:17:00,1
Surprised that it didn't turn into a brawl. I guss JD Vance was not there to start it.,blackcain,2025-05-06T15:43:50,1
My God how insulting.   This bastard just spews that crap out right while meeting with the Canadian PM.,Do-you-see-it-now,2025-05-06T16:47:30,1

I'm 99% sure that's exactly what they did to Fred Trump when his dementia worsened. They set up a fake office and just let him sign fake papers all day.,gfh110,2025-05-06T14:08:20,1
He had a fake oval office in his gilded shithole in Florida.  Pity his family just didn't tell him he won in 2020 and did an elaborate fake presidency so that he really believed it. ,Designer-Contract852,2025-05-06T14:28:31,1

Are we sure that’s not what is already happening and this isn’t the Miller administration?,Foucaultshadow1,2025-05-06T15:14:43,1
"Exactly! The entirety of the USA being fucked up beyond belief on all levels, beyond anything most of us could ever fathom possible.  Nazi Germany is developing in the United States. Actually, Nazi Germany's foundation came from United States and Jim Crow's ideology. America is just going back to it's own roots. This failed state was built on the foundation of enslaving black people and after stealing the land from the indigenous people, they condemned them to unspeakable atrocities.    Republican voters fucking love this shit and the rest of their country's citizens are doing absolutely nothing about it.  1/3 of the country didn't even vote and are just as much to blame for allowing this all to happen.The majority of their country is straight trash.  You say anything about it and you'll get the Americans (who are on Reddit eating Big Macs) say, 'wHy dOnT yOu dO sOmEtHiNg''... because thank God I'm not American!!...'TeLL uS wHaT sHoULd wE dO'...that's not my fucking problem. Y'all got here, so figure it out before it's too late, which it probably already is.  'wE aRe pRoTeStiNg' ...well not enough of you are.. organize a general strike...'i'M oN tHe pHoNe tO mY rEpReSeNtAtiVe eVeRyDay' (bites Big Mac and drinks some Soda) ...lmao   ...Al Green was alone in speaking out during Trump's speech in front of Congress. His weak ass Democrat colleagues HeLd uP SiGnS iN pRoTeSt... Did you hear that there was a vote in the house that passed to censure Al Green? 10 fucking Democrats voted in favor of it...what the fuck is wrong with these people??  Remember when the Americans would condemn Germans for 'allowing the Holocaust to happen'... 'Why did the Germans just stand by and do nothing'...  Well .. maybe people shouldn't be so quick to judge.. because this is all literally happening again... History is repeating itself.  Remember when people would 'wish they had a time machine so they could go back and kill Hitler'? ...where are those guys?? why are they so quiet?  The United States has become a shit hole of a country.  They will not be held in any regard by Historians when this country and their citizens are looked back upon in the future.",Muthafuckaaaaa,2025-05-06T14:39:59,1

"I think you need to take a step back and realize this isn't about you. Yes, there are plenty of us in the US who despise our current government but that doesn't actually matter. This is the situation we are in. People living in the countries we threaten are absolutely vindicated in hating the United States right now.",MyTieHasCloudsOnIt,2025-05-06T14:25:47,1
"Nope. That's the kicker, it isn't just this situation. The USA has never been 'allies' - friends maybe but a friend that can never be trusted. As an Australian-born Canadian I grew up further detached from the US and know exactly what your country is and always has been. I'm just glad my adoptive country is waking up.",Dapper_Raptor_,2025-05-06T14:22:13,1

Yeah this isn't Russia while many of us didn't vote for him many people did choose this. So in my eyes other countries have every right to feel this way and just be like fuck those Americans on a personal level and not just the abstract of the country itself   It's not like Russia where no one has a choice who is in charge (yes I know there are many Russians ther support Putin. Not really hard with full dictatorship powered propaganda,ATLfalcons27,2025-05-06T14:37:09,1
