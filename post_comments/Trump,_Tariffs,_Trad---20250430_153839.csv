"I like the premise, but I disagree that we should try to deal with China, who simply reverse engineers everything we make, and steals intellectual property. We should focus on trading with SE Asia. China's workforce is contracting so quickly that they will be unable to compete for global manufacturing within 20 years.",Jondiesel78,2025-04-30T16:17:52,2
"[Victor Davis Hanson](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/victor-davis-hanson) reviews the activities of the Trump administration over its first hundred days in office, with a focus on trade and US trade deficits. Hanson outlines what he sees as a successful strategy for the administration to succeed in current trade disputes, encouraging US officials to aim for partial reductions of trade deficits with trading partners as part of a gradual approach. At the same time, Hanson suggests, “Trump might curb talk of ‘revenue,’ as if we can return to the pre–income tax age, prior to 1913, when federal revenue came largely from tariffs.” Hanson explains that tariffs today account for a very small percentage of federal revenues and that most estimates of the Trump tariff plan show they still would not be able to wholly substitute for other federal revenue sources over the decade ahead. As Hanson concludes, “Trump will win this tariff spat if he sticks to ‘parity’ and ‘fairness’ and downplays talking about gargantuan ‘profits.’”",HooverInstitution,2025-04-30T15:38:59,2
