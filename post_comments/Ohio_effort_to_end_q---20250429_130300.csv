"What's this? Regular people in Ohio have realized that officers should be held to the same laws and standard of conduct that the citizens they encounter?   You don't suppose.. Ohioans figured out that when a certain group of human beings are given legitimate power over the lives and rights of others, and also provided immunity from being held responsible for abuses of that power, it almost guarantees that some of those individuals with power will in fact abuse it?   Bc, that would be correct. I hope they win their fight.",LibertineLibra,2025-04-29T13:15:59,24
