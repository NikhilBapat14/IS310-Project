"Shhh, the MSM can’t cover such a story.  It would make Trump and his administration look good.",mdws1977,2025-05-09T09:32:26,26
"Inflation for April will be released May 13th.   Democrat hacks and Redditors will root for high inflation for sure. If it comes in low, the next Fed meeting can result in a rate decrease which can lift the market back above all time highs.",JTuck333,2025-05-09T11:49:32,10
It's probably covered.    Difference is in how much attention they give it,Dutchtdk,2025-05-09T10:44:07,7
Inflation is never gone but about %2 is manageable and wont harm the economy.  While under Biden it averaged 4.95% and in 2022 peaked at 9%,ComputerRedneck,2025-05-09T12:18:06,1
I’d like to see some deflation for a while.  I know that’s an unpopular opinion.  But we need to get prices actually under control.,Narrow-Trash-8839,2025-05-09T11:00:55,-4
"Yeah, don't mention this.  The terminal TDS cases on reddit like 7% mortgage rates.",Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-05-09T13:49:28,5
The 2% is actually a goal set by the fed to encourage spending/growth. We didn't have inflation like that prior to fiat currency.,Mountain_Man_88,2025-05-09T20:08:15,0
