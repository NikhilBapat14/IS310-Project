"Someone posted this on here a while back, and I think it is brilliant. It can be applied generally, or in isolation on most political questions.   ""In the beginning, there was only barbarism. The strong took what they wanted from the weak. At some point the weak banded together and said 'No more of this, we're going to have rules,' and they placed collectively-enforced restrictions on what the strong could do. A conservative is someone who thinks this principle has gone too far. A liberal is someone who thinks it has not yet gone far enough.""",GiantPineapple,2025-04-30T19:10:01,122
"In the Burkian sense (generally considered the father of modern conservatism) conservativism is defined by stopping or slowing change and making what change does happen keep with tradition. ""Tradition"" here is broadly understood with things like prejudices defined as ""latent wisdom"", so traditional hierarchies are explicitly part of it.  On the other hand leftism is defined by endeavouring to reduce or remove hierarchies.  So there's our core definition of left versus right because traditional hierarchy is explicitly the point of conflict.  What does that mean in practice in the US? Well, look at our traditional hierarchies, money, race, gender, etc. Things that entrench those hierarchies, eg anti-union policy is inherently conservative and the opposite is inherently left. Granted, there's debates about the actual effect of the policy and sometimes it can have differing effects on different hierarchies, but that's the principal.",AdumbroDeus,2025-04-30T20:55:46,11
"The labels really are ambiguous. They reflect the disorganized and casual nature of our political discourse – more often than not the labels are being used to try to define an enemy.  Although I fall into the convenience of using those terms as much as anybody, I am trying to learn a habit of looking to actual organizations rather than generalizations. I have an understanding of the politics of Move On, Indivisible, the UAW, the Proud Boys, and Project 2025. These are useful units of understanding.

"Right: Appeal to heritage / tradition  Left: Appeal to progress  Your professor is generally correct.  It is quite possible for policies to be supported by elements of both the right and the left.  Their motivations are likely different.  The US is an outlier compared to other western nations when it comes to its conservatives / right.  Conservatives outside the US don't have the hostility to social programs or the love of guns that you find in the US.    You would be hard pressed to find a conservative in the UK who wants to scrap the NHS.  Conservatives outside the US typically favor gun controls.  They want to maintain order.  The first social security and quasi-universal healthcare programs were implemented by Bismarck, an imperialist monarchist.  His goals were to support industrial growth and oppose the rise of Marxism.    There is the ""political compass"" that aligns views along two axes: right / left and authoritarian / (civil) libertarian.  There are authoritarians and civil libertarians on both sides.  I would suggest that you could craft a variation of the compass that uses populist / establishment as fairly close substitutes for authoritarian / (civil) libertarian.    You could overlay horseshoe theory onto this, with the far right and far left having more in common with each other than they do with those others who are allegedly on their respective sides.  It's the authoritarian / populism that brings them together: Both are waging wars on elites who they blame for their problems.  How they differ is in their definitions of elites, but they share similar nihilistic attitudes.",I405CA,2025-05-01T10:52:18,4
"It's honestly a fuzzy dichotomy since political alignments shift decade to decade or region to region.  What is ""right wing"" in Canada may look a lot like what the left in the US advocates for.   For me, I tend to think of it more in terms of worldview.  The conservative/right worldview is that people are generally awful when left to their own devices.  We are a flawed species and while some freedom is good, too much freedom just leads to chaos and anarchy.  People NEED someone to tell them what the right thing to do is and someone else to make sure they do it.  People NEED strong examples of what happens when you don't follow the rules to they will be motivated to do the right thing.   The progressive/left worldview is that people are generally good. That if you trust people to make the right decisions, they normally will in the absence of other contributing factors.  Crime can be attributed some to nature, but ultimately progressives/left see it as a nurture issue--the systems and culture people exist in predispose them to antisocial behavior.  They feel that the heart can be changed, that people can better themselves given the right set of circumstances.  The liberal left, therefore, sets about trying to ensure those circumstances exist--lower taxes on the poor, higher taxes on the rich, more equitable distribution of resources, etc. The liberal/left is OK if achieving these better conditions requires the government to act in a forceful way.",twim19,2025-05-01T08:09:10,6
"If it's based on using the government to improve things for the majority of people, regulate businesses to provide a safe but competitive environment, protect the actual environment, protect individual freedoms, promote science, tax the wealthy and redistribute that money, build infrastructure, pave the way for legal immigration (talking point, they've done nothing) it's left.  If it's meant to exclude ""others,"" promote Christian morals as dictated by the wealthy clergy--especially if it flies in the face of established science, promotes concentration of wealth at the cost of most individuals, only recently pave the way to lock up immigrants (before this, they did exactly what the left did basically), and generally just do the opposite of what the left is doing, it's right.  As far as warring and invading other countries to protect our national interests, I dunno.  Miss anything?  I apologize for the right sounding terrible.

It's hard to recognize the leaning and bias of the information we come across.

"I don't think the divide of politics into left and right has been helpful at any point, even if only used for self-identification. People tend to focus on left and right when they should actually be focused on consistency.   I.e. Traditionally, christian values have been strongly ascribed to the right. However, as we can see from current politics, this is mostly virtue signalling.   Trump is by far the most inconsistent president of modern US history, but the majority of his voters do not care about it. Thus, it doesn't make sense to measure policies that are brought up by this administration in terms of left and right. It simply doesn't matter.   I hope that this situation will eventually display the value of critical assessment instead of blind following (which is a problem on both sides of the aisle).",oneawesomewave,2025-05-01T09:53:54,2
"The divide between left and right is fundamentally about belief in the existence of a social hierarchy.   The right believes humans are organized into strata; a child below the mother, the mother below the father, the father below the boss, the boss below the president, the president below God. They believe society needs to be organized around this hierarchy, that those at the top necessarily must be more privileged than those at the bottom, and that you must be completely deferential to those above you.   The left believes there are no strata; they believe all humans are equal, that the lowliest homeless drug-addicted bum is just as worthy as the president of the country. They believe society should not be organized around hierarchies and should instead treat everyone equally and uplift those who are floundering.   Every disagreement the left and right have fundamentally arise out of this dichotomy.",GrandMasterPuba,2025-05-01T11:05:53,2

"To some extent, the leftness or rightness of a policy is emergent, not inherent. That is, what makes it a left-wing policy is if most of its supporters are left wing.   Some issues do not fall neatly into the Left bucket or the Right bucket. For example, the majority of Jewish Americans support Israel's response to the October 7 attacks ([source](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/04/02/how-us-jews-are-experiencing-the-israel-hamas-war/)), but pro-Israel sentiment is more common in Republicans than Democrats ([source](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/04/08/how-americans-view-israel-and-the-israel-hamas-war-at-the-start-of-trumps-second-term/)), but most Jewish voters vote Democrat ([source](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/04/09/party-identification-among-religious-groups-and-religiously-unaffiliated-voters/)).   Another example: antivax sentiment used to be left-coded because it was associated with crunchy hippie parents who were against ""Big Pharma,"" and being anti-corporation is generally considered a left-wing thing. But now antivax sentiment is more associated with right-wingers than it used to be, and there are antivaxxers across the political spectrum.   Another example: gay marriage is usually seen as left-wing, but Andrew Sullivan wrote an an article called ""The Conservative Case for Gay Marriage,"" and indeed marriage in general is more right-wing than left-wing. Republicans typically win the majority of married women while Democrats win the majority of single women; anyone who objects to cohabitation is likely to be right-wing; and some on the left disdain marriage for being anti-feminist or assimilationist. Gay marriage is progressive in that it is a departure from how marriage has existed in the past; but it is conservative in that it promotes marriage and fitting gay relationships into an existing and longstanding social institution.",dear-mycologistical,2025-05-10T05:19:34,1

The institution of religion usually is used to oppress a perceived enemy, leading to an impossibility to reason and find a compromise. The military insitution usually is used to wage wars of might, and decide who's viewpoint is the correct one on this alone. The police institution usually is used to strike down at the people who are down on their luck enough that they need to resort to less-than-ideal behavior to survive.  ***You can, easily, point out positive things that each of those institutions have done, but those positive things are usually happening when those institutions dip into left-wing ideology.***  Left-wingers like to free up some of the drug use laws because people who were doing nothing wrong and just used weed to calm down before bed were jailed for merely having some in their car (and there is a non-zero amount of it that was plabted evidence, too, but you don't even need that data point to make the argument).

"This is a great example of how conservative ideology dodges systemic responsibility by retreating into individual moralism.  >If you have excess funds, what are you doing with your own money?  That’s not a serious question. It's a rhetorical deflection. The issue isn't what *individuals* do with their spare change. It's about what *societies* owe their members in a wealthy, interdependent nation. Framing social justice as a matter of personal charity is like telling people in a burning building to hand each other bottled water instead of installing sprinklers.  > Are you giving extra to the government?  No, because systems aren’t built on voluntary participation. You don’t fund the fire department by asking who wants to chip in. We have taxes because there are shared responsibilities that require shared investment. The point isn’t whether liberals give more, it’s that a functioning society doesn’t outsource its safety net to vibes and donations.  > Everyone could be doing more to help through charitable means.  Sure. But when the need is structural (underpaid workers, medical bankruptcies, housing crises) charity is a Band-Aid on a bullet wound. You don’t solve a dam collapse by forming a bucket brigade.  >Sitting around pointing fingers doesn’t help anyone.  Actually, calling out power structures *is* how things change. Pointing fingers at systemic inequality, underfunded programs, and tax-dodging billionaires does help people, by forcing policy shifts, not just bake sales.  So yes, conservatives want the freedom to choose how to help. But the hard truth is: **most people won’t, and even if they did, it wouldn’t be enough.** That’s why we don’t rely on personal virtue to pave roads, run schools, or regulate air travel. We don’t leave it up to chance when it actually matters.  This isn’t about moral superiority. It’s about moral systems. And the conservative one, as outlined here, just doesn’t scale.",xtianlaw,2025-05-02T10:23:32,1
