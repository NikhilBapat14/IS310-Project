"‚ÄúUnfriendly‚Äù and ‚Äúenemy‚Äù are pretty different. I‚Äôd imagine many Canadians wouldn‚Äôt initially be friendly to me, a US citizen, and I wouldn‚Äôt blame them. *I‚Äôd be pissed off if some foreign nation tried bullying me too.* That doesn‚Äôt mean I think they‚Äôre my enemy.",Bobobarbarian,2025-04-04T21:33:30,12

It‚Äôs tough for me to understand how does an adult get brainwashed into this drivel. I would think a Canadian would be shocked that there has been so much hostility brewing already before this year.,Potato2266,2025-04-04T21:17:45,4

Probably registered Dems that are actually Reps ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è sounds weird but it‚Äôs a thing for primaries or whatever. Idk I might be wrong,No_Lawyer5152,2025-04-04T20:52:29,19

"This is not a sourced or well-labeled chart so no idea how much that actually represents. But let's just say if you talk to a bunch of Democrats, like 1/10 of them will be a bit *off.*",Apple-Dust,2025-04-04T21:17:09,14

Because Canada and the EU are technically less friendly than they were last year currently.  It's not on them though.  It's on the raving lunatic that's currently sitting in the White House.,sysadminbj,2025-04-05T09:55:36,1
