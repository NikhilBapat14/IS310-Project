Explain why? They have been at odds for many generations. And he wants it to end.  So what did he say wrong?,gratefulguitar57,2025-05-07T09:12:06,3
It would have been if that's all he said but in totality his statement was fine and appropriate.  It's easy to just take one sentence out of context and label it idiotic. It's also wrong and lazy.,Key-Monk6159,2025-05-07T10:54:07,1
Not sure how that’s funny. It hasn’t been quiet,MapleMonstera,2025-05-07T00:11:53,58
This was retaliation to the terrorist attack a week or two ago. There was also a 2 month war in 2019 and another conflict in 2021. Educate yourself before speaking on topics you clearly dont know anything about.,dragonrite,2025-05-06T23:20:48,98

You say “them”.   Who is “them” that are risking war?   The US had nothing to do with India and Pakistan’s latest spat.  Islamic extremist in/from Pakistan had everything to do with that.,Narrow-Trash-8839,2025-05-07T08:55:14,2
And you don't have to be such a snarky asshole.,ComputerRedneck,2025-05-07T10:37:47,-2
"Sorry, I missed it. Last I remember hearing about them was back around Obama when India said something about Pakistan could nuke one city of India but India would wipe them off the map with nukes.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-07T10:37:30,-1
