"The tariffs are going to have a compounding effect as long as they are still in place.  This is the BEGINNING of an era of massive pain, economic contraction, job loss, and stagflation.    Thank you to the very brilliant ""swing voters"" who, because they were sad that eggs were slightly too expensive, voted to permanently destroy American exceptionalism and impoverish us for generations to come.",Historical_Emotion43,2025-04-03T09:37:54,46
Correct me if I'm wrong but the only reason trump has the ability to create these tariffs is the state of emergency he declared over (checking notes) fentanyl.  Can't congress cancel the state of emergency and end this train wreck,ktreanor,2025-04-03T10:30:48,4

"Doubt it. If you were dumb enough to vote for Trump in 2024, or not vote at all, you’re dumb enough to believe that he’s somehow doing a good job and has some kind of master plan. I believe no level of fuckery is going to change the minds of our inbred population",LoudCrickets72,2025-04-03T11:31:55,5
