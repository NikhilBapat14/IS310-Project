"Trump's ""presidency"" has very little to do with him.  He can barely string two sentences together, let alone create a relevant, cognitive thought in his tiny pea-brain.  The Project 2025 team are who's pulling all the strings.  He's simply signing off on anything they put in front of him.  He sometimes comes up with something pulled out of his ass and throws it against the wall, but generally is only worried about his next golf trip and watching Faux News so he can rage-tweet at his detractors.",uteman1011,2025-04-29T10:47:55,164

He has placed seemingly every lever of state power in the hands of [unprincipled loyalists](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/10/kash-patel-trump-national-security-council/679566/?utm_source=msn) and has used the threat of investigation, prosecution, and punitive defunding to extort media [owners](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/03/washington-post-bezos-trump-cartoon-ann-telnaes/681406/?utm_source=msn), [law firms](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/03/big-law-trump-executive-order/682173/?utm_source=msn), and [universities](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/04/harvard-chooses-defiance/682457/?utm_source=msn) into compliance. He has attempted to establish, in his immigration-enforcement powers, the ability to disappear people who may or may not have committed crimes, and may or may not even reside in the country illegally, brushing aside court orders to stop.  ""Trump has inscribed a double standard into law enforcement, through generous pardons of allies and selective enforcement. At minimum, he has cleared the way for systematic corruption. At maximum, he is laying the groundwork to ignore court orders that go against him and to construct an extralegal regime in which laws bind only his enemies.""  ""Trump’s first major domestic-policy decision was to hand nearly carte-blanche power to Elon Musk, a man whose limited knowledge of government was exacerbated by a boundless ego and a weakness for conspiracy theories. Musk first promised to cut the federal budget by $2 trillion, a target he revised downward to $1 trillion and then, as of this writing, $150 billion. Even that figure, 93 percent smaller than the original goal, almost certainly overstates the actual savings Musk has accomplished. In fact, by cutting such functions as IRS tax collection, the DOGE project could very well end up costing the government much more than it saves.""  ""Trump’s ineptitude has been most obvious in the prosecution of his trade war against the planet. His allies cast this as a negotiating strategy, but the strategy, such as it is, requires him to use the “madman theory” to gain leverage by scaring the rest of the world into thinking he is crazy enough to instigate a global economic recession, while simultaneously reassuring American businesses that he is not. He has accordingly caromed between bluster and retreat, causing the U.S. economy to absorb nearly all the costs of a total trade war without having any chance to capture whatever theoretical benefit Trump hopes to achieve.""  ""Trump’s first 100 days have set the country on an unsustainable course. The clash between the president’s determination to rule and his inability to govern has generated two opposing forces: a weaponized, illiberal state, and a smoldering political backlash. One of them will have to break.""",ChiGuy6124,2025-04-29T10:41:08,29

"Honestly, it's pretty alarming how quickly things have spiraled, the article really hits home how his policies are leading to a weaponized state, and it's concerning to see a government seemingly ignoring court orders, but hey, there was that brief moment of bipartisan cooperation to eliminate inefficiencies, which at least suggests that some people still value good governance, but, really, how can we possibly prevent this erosion of democratic norms, and ensure our institutions aren't further undermined?",avid-learner-bot,2025-04-29T10:44:01,19

Why did anyone expect anything different this time?  It has never been sustainable.  The big concern now is how much damage is going to be caused.    It’s too late for “what if” and “remember when” talk.  It doesn’t matter if Obama or Biden would have been judged more harshly. Of course they would.  That’s easy to point out.
