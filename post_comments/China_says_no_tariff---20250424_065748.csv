This is a constant tactic of Trump's.... gaslight the media and have it repeat a falsehood in order to seek comment (and pressure) from the other side.  It's awesome that people are starting to call out these puerile tactics.,MagicBingo,2025-04-24T07:02:31,367

">Commerce Ministry spokesman He Yadong said Thursday that any “claims about the progress of China-U.S. trade negotiations are groundless as trying to catch the wind and have no factual basis.”   >“China’s position is consistent, and we are open to consultations and dialogues, but any form of consultations and negotiations must be conducted on the basis of mutual respect and in an equal manner,”  Reporters need to start asking when Trump plans to call Xi. Last I heard Xi didn't go to Trump's inauguration and Xi still hasn't talked to Trump since he's been back in office.  Xi has a plan for retaliating against Trump’s gamesmanship   https://archive.ph/0s5OX#selection-2413.0-2417.304   > Many Chinese argue that Xi is stronger politically and the economy is more self-reliant and resilient, even amid recent challenges. Chinese analysts view the US economy as more fragile and American politics as deeply divided. Geopolitically, Beijing sees US influence as declining throughout the global south and Asia — and support for China’s vision as rising.  >  > Xi has already signalled that he will treat his ties to Trump as a purely business relationship, albeit Don Corleone style. He won’t personally embrace Trump and will retaliate early and hard in order to generate leverage. Beijing in effect rejected Trump’s invitation for Xi to attend the inauguration.  >  > Hence Xi’s four “red lines” at a November meeting with President Joe Biden in Peru in a clear message to the incoming administration.   >   Xi tells Biden he will work with Trump to manage US-China differences   https://archive.ph/QF7Jc   > “‘Small yard, high fences’ is not what a major country should pursue,” Xi told Biden.   >  > Beijing’s planned responses to Trump fall into three baskets: retaliation, adaptation and diversification. Mirroring US policies, Beijing in recent years has created a range of export controls, investment restrictions and regulatory investigations capable of hurting US companies. Beijing is unable to match tariff for tariff, so it will seek to impose costs in ways that inflict maximum pain. For China, failing to retaliate would signal weakness domestically and only encourage Trump.  >  > In late 2024, Xi also participated for the first time in meetings with the heads of 10 major international economic organisations. His message was clear: China will be the leading force for global economic stability, prosperity and openness, and opposes all forms of protectionism.  >  > Much could go wrong. Beijing’s confidence is matched by the Trump team. Both sides believe they possess the upper hand, can impose more costs and withstand more pain. The stage is set for a complicated, destabilising dynamic which, at best, results in a ceasefire. And that’s only on economic issues, not on Taiwan, the South China Sea, tech competition or nuclear force modernisation. The cold war is starting to look quaint in comparison.   China Just Turned Off U.S. Supplies Of Minerals Critical For Defense & Cleantech   https://cleantechnica.com/2025/04/05/china-just-turned-off-u-s-supplies-of-minerals-critical-for-defense-cleantech/   > What China did wasn’t a ban, at least not in name. They called it export licensing. Sounds like something a trade lawyer might actually be excited about. But make no mistake: this was a surgical strike. They didn’t need to say no. They just needed to say “maybe later” to the right set of paperwork. These licenses give Beijing control over not just where these materials go, but how fast they go, in what quantity, and to which politically convenient customers. >  > The U.S.? Let’s just say Washington should get comfortable waiting behind the rope line. The licenses have to be applied for and the end use including country of final destination must be clearly spelled out. Licenses for end uses in the U.S. are unlikely to be approved. What’s astonishing is how predictable this all was. China has spent decades building its dominance over these supply chains, while the U.S. was busy outsourcing, divesting, and cheerfully ignoring every report that said, “Hey, maybe 90% dependence on a single country we keep starting trade wars with and rattling sabers at is a bad idea.” >  > Try ramping up your semiconductor fab or solar plant when your indium source just dried up. It’s a fun exercise in learning which of your suppliers used to be dependent on Beijing but never mentioned it in the quarterly call. >  > The materials China just restricted aren’t random. They’re chosen with the precision of someone who’s read U.S. product spec sheets and defense procurement orders. Start with dysprosium. If your electric motor needs to function at high temperatures—and they all do—then mostly it is using neodymium magnets doped with dysprosium. No dysprosium, no thermal stability. No thermal stability, no functioning motor in your F-35 or your Mustang Mach-E. China controls essentially the entire supply of dysprosium, and no, there is no magical mine in Wyoming or Quebec waiting in the wings. If dysprosium doesn’t come out of China, it doesn’t come out at all. It’s the spinal cord of electrification, and right now China’s holding the vertebrae. >  > So here we are. China has responded to Trump’s tariffs by cutting off U.S. supply of some of the most essential ingredients of the modern world.",tech57,2025-04-24T07:03:54,52

"China is doing what nobody else has done yet - holding Trump accountable for his reprehensible behavior, rhetoric, and monumental stupidity. It feels like they've decided to make an example of him -- and it's an impressive flex.  He's been bullying everyone from random US citizens, to ivy league schools, to allied countries. In almost all cases, they either lack the power or the willingness to resist.   . . .  China (literally): We don't care, we've existed for 5000 years mostly without the US and we'll exist for 5000 more.   They're sending fewer ships, they're cancelling aircraft orders, not buying US meat, etc... Imagine wanting to send a message to the world to establish your dominance as a world power, resisting the US President is about the most powerful non-military action possible, and Trump is about the softest target they could hope for. I'm not cheering them on, but damned if Trump didn't hand them a win on a silver platter. Historically pathetic leadership.",co-wurker,2025-04-24T09:52:29,23

"> China won't let their own citizens move their money overseas.  > The rest of the world is realigning and will happily take the opportunity to cast off the old #1.  The most important thing going on right now is the transition to green energy. China makes it. China sells it.   Pakistan’s 22 GW Solar Shock: How a Fragile State Went Full Clean Energy   https://cleantechnica.com/2025/04/04/pakistans-22-gw-solar-shock-how-a-fragile-state-went-full-clean-energy/   >It’s more solar than Canada has installed in total. It’s more than the UK added in the past five years. And yet it didn’t make a blip in most Western media. While the U.S. continued its decade-long existential crisis about grid interconnection queues and Europe squabbled over permitting reforms, Pakistan skipped the drama and just bought the panels.   USA made green tech unaffordable to people living in USA. Chinese EVs are illegal. Solar and batteries are tariffed.   >the announcement of mesospheric tariffs of up to 3,521 per cent on solar cells from south-east Asian countries.  It's not that China is good or bad, it's that China has priorities that other countries agree with. Most countries don't think Republicans dismantling USA and the world order is a shared priority with their interests.    >The rest of the world is realigning and will happily take the opportunity to cast off the old #1.  They are not really happy about it they are just not Republican stupid. Sunshine is cheaper than fossil fuels.  China Just Turned Off U.S. Supplies Of Minerals Critical For Defense & Cleantech   https://cleantechnica.com/2025/04/05/china-just-turned-off-u-s-supplies-of-minerals-critical-for-defense-cleantech/   > What China did wasn’t a ban, at least not in name. They called it export licensing. Sounds like something a trade lawyer might actually be excited about. But make no mistake: this was a surgical strike. They didn’t need to say no. They just needed to say “maybe later” to the right set of paperwork. These licenses give Beijing control over not just where these materials go, but how fast they go, in what quantity, and to which politically convenient customers. >  > The U.S.? Let’s just say Washington should get comfortable waiting behind the rope line. The licenses have to be applied for and the end use including country of final destination must be clearly spelled out. Licenses for end uses in the U.S. are unlikely to be approved. What’s astonishing is how predictable this all was. China has spent decades building its dominance over these supply chains, while the U.S. was busy outsourcing, divesting, and cheerfully ignoring every report that said, “Hey, maybe 90% dependence on a single country we keep starting trade wars with and rattling sabers at is a bad idea.” >  > Try ramping up your semiconductor fab or solar plant when your indium source just dried up. It’s a fun exercise in learning which of your suppliers used to be dependent on Beijing but never mentioned it in the quarterly call. >  > The materials China just restricted aren’t random. They’re chosen with the precision of someone who’s read U.S. product spec sheets and defense procurement orders. Start with dysprosium. If your electric motor needs to function at high temperatures—and they all do—then mostly it is using neodymium magnets doped with dysprosium. No dysprosium, no thermal stability. No thermal stability, no functioning motor in your F-35 or your Mustang Mach-E. China controls essentially the entire supply of dysprosium, and no, there is no magical mine in Wyoming or Quebec waiting in the wings. If dysprosium doesn’t come out of China, it doesn’t come out at all. It’s the spinal cord of electrification, and right now China’s holding the vertebrae. >  > So here we are.

"It does not really. The conditions that result in that sort of growth are a lot more complicated than the competence of an administration, and it is entirely possible to have record growth even when an incompetent person is in charge. There is no way to compare the current reality against a theoretical one where they were more or less competent, and so it might be that they have actually made conditions worse than they otherwise would have been.  So you have to look directly policy. And there are a lot of cracks in the chinese governemnts handling of their economy. They are essentially betting against a future with infinite growth while reaping the results of having large amounts of extremely cheap labor. You do not need a competent government to grow in that siatution, you just need one that will not tank your own economy on purpose, but you might need one to stick the landing.
