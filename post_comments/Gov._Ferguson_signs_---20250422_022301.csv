>'...unless such force...is acting under authority of The President of the United States.'     Then what good is it?,invalidpassword,2025-04-22T03:29:09,79
">""NEW SECTION. **Sec. 1.** A new section is added to chapter 38.08  >RCW to read as follows:  >No armed military force from another state, territory, or district is permitted to enter the state of Washington for the purpose of doing military duty therein, without the permission of the governor, **unless such force** has been called into active service of the United States, and **is acting under authority of the president of the United States**.""  MENA: ""This law ...  protects us from unauthorized and unaccountable military actions.""  Sadly, no.  That last 'new section' may have been required for passage, but it all but nullifies the usefulness of this bill. might as well send Trump a ""Cordially Invited...""",XSinTrick6666,2025-04-22T03:20:49,38
I wonder if they are worried about the possibility of the Idaho National Guard being called up by Idaho’s governor.,Significant-Dot6627,2025-04-22T06:01:56,9
Wouldn’t this be a bad thing? I mean like on January 6th other states had to send there national guard to stop it.,Demonking3343,2025-04-22T03:51:51,6
Let's stay prepared just in case.        I don't want to have a legal discussion while an invading force is trying to occupy by force.,faith_apnea,2025-04-22T09:22:32,4

"Look barring militias looks like a good idea on the surface because the vast majority are right wing, but ultimately this is a constitutional right they cant just be allowed to take from you",Emotional_Contest_10,2025-04-22T13:51:40,2

"National Guard are state level. This prevents Trump from “ordering” a neighboring state to “invade”. To do that, he would *have* to declare martial law, in which case, theres state-level repercussions for that too.   The clause is basically in place to prevent the courts from nullifying it for being unconstitutional, which it would be. It’s not a great solution but it’s best for long-term planning.",vmsrii,2025-04-22T11:10:25,15

"Yeah, I'm in eastern WA, and Idaho has been really pushing the border recently. I see Idaho staties well on the wrong side of the border regularly, and there have been a lot of rumblings from them of trying to enforce some of their more regressive laws over here regardless of jurisdiction.  Plus, they've been talking for years about annexing the eastern parts of Oregon and Washington.  This law won't stop anything, but it might be enough to get some Idaho Guard units to drag their feet and give Washington more of a window to respond.",ALWETP,2025-04-22T12:34:00,5
Can't let that happen again! Gotta fix the holes for next time,purplemagecat,2025-04-22T09:40:26,3
Or if you want to protect your citizens from weaponization of the military.,FatStoner2FitSober,2025-04-22T09:15:02,8
"It's a response to Idaho making rather loud noises about enforcing its laws on Washington and Oregon.  They've been pushing the border and talking about annexation of Eastern WA and OR for years, but it's been escalating this year with a lot of Idaho law enforcement ""forgetting"" to turn around at the border, and laws being passed criminalizing coming to WA or OR to receive certain types of healthcare that are legal here.  It's just a clusterfuck of a situation, and WA is doing its best to try and protect those of us who live in the eastern half of Washington from Idaho's escalating sabre rattling.",ALWETP,2025-04-22T12:46:10,3
"Yes, it seems like it just prevents another state’s national guard from operating/invading in Washington state unless the governor explicitly asks them for help with something. Sounds like something you would pass if you were preparing for the possibility of civil war.",bad_squishy_,2025-04-22T09:56:52,14
"I think Washington state's main worry is about Trump invoking the Insurrection Act and sending in various military over our people, regardless of states' wishes / rights.  On Jan 20 he gave DoD and DHS 90 days to report on whether he should invoke Insurrection Act.  Sunday was the deadline.  >  >The 19th-century law would allow the use of active-duty military personnel to perform law-enforcement duties within the US.  >This includes the National Guard - a branch of the US armed forces traditionally reserved for domestic emergencies and disasters.  >  >US presidents can invoke the law if they determine that ""unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion"" against the government make it ""impracticable to enforce"" US law ""by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings"".
