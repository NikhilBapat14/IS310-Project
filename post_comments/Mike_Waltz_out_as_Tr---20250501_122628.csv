So Bessent then? Or Rubio? Crummy as they are they're some of his last tethers to physical reality. He can't fire J.D. so we're stuck with that shit. ,Competitive-Bike-277,2025-05-01T13:51:18,1
"I have not seen any evidence of Trump being tethered to reality since he took office. Anyway, reality will make itself known as far as the peace negotiations go. Putin does not want peace, and the EU countries are not going to recognize the annexed regions unless Ukraine does. Trump can throw as many tantrums as he likes, but the members of his administration can't change those things for him.",z900r,2025-05-01T15:04:05,1
