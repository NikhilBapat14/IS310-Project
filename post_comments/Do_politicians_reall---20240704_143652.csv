There are many stories where “known enemies” collaborate to craft a bill or compromise to get a piece of legislation through their respective organizations. So while hate is often publicly displayed the emotion is tempered behind closed doors. The only possible exceptions maybe a few MAGA republicans and  progressive democrats. Just my take,rastel,2024-07-05T02:30:14,1
"We don't know.  Some of them probably do hate each other, others don't.  Trump in particular is the kind of person who'd really make enemies rather than just being opposition.  From what behind the scenes reporting I've heard; it's uncommon to hate each other but does happen.  Things may also be changing some in this high partisanship era, as some of the things they do are really frustrating and angering to other sides.",zlefin_actual,2024-07-05T09:55:05,1
"In Congress, the people who get the most ""hate"" are the folks you'd suspect. Many in congress actually want to be productive and accomplish things, but of the 435 members of the House, there are maybe 20 Rs and 20 Ds who exist exclusively to throw sand in the gears of progress to get more famous. Those are the really hated members among the rest of the Congress: think Thomas Massie, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert on the right, and AOC and the squad on the left. Relative to their peers, these members are very unproductive in terms of doing the work required to govern: crafting and passing legislation, doing committee work, etc.",FiveDollarHoller,2024-07-06T11:57:48,1
If politicians weren't allowed to talk about what they are going to do and only be allowed to talk about the results of what they have done you'd almost never see or hear them because they'd have almost nothing to talk about.  Physical real world measurable results always 100% of the time trump any amount of windbagging.  Words are cheap and everybody can afford them. Showing results of real worthwhile actions: infinitely more valuable and not many people can afford this.,[deleted],2024-11-11T02:34:38,1
