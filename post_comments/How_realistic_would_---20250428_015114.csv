"How is what you're suggesting fundamentally different than the Respect for Marriage Act?

"Most Americans do not study enough to understand the idea of private, arbitrary, contracted consequences executed by the state's authority. They only understand honor and loyalty. If they did understand, the ruling would include other minority groups by not specifying gender/sex, or amounts. Add to that the cultural embedding of ""you get married in a church,"" and it makes it difficult for them to understand.  This law would get cut in half and only the second part would be passed.",zayelion,2025-04-28T07:24:12,10

"The US is currently an autocracy controlled by religious cult.  We are much closer to banning gay marriage than protecting it.   This is wildly unfeasible, but to illustrate why requires a deeper dive.  First, to pass a bill the party passing that bill needs to control 60 Senate seats. This isn’t feasible to start with, and hasn’t happened in over a decade. To avoid internal party fights, it is better to have 64 or more sitting Senators, which hasn’t happened since the early 1960s.  But this understates the difficulty of the Democratic party gaining those seats. The Senate is deliberately drawn to favor Republicans. It isn’t simply a matter of the Democrats getting 60% of the popular vote; they need far more than that.  Think of the states as a sliding scale (I’m using the Cook Partisan Voting Index for the following numbers). The most liberal state, Vermont, leans 16 points towards the Democratic party.  So in a national -16 environment, we’d still expect Democrats to have 50/50 odds in Vermont. Meanwhile, Wyoming is the most Republican state at +25, so in a national environment favoring the democrats by 25 points (62.5-37.5) we’d still expect Wyoming to be a coinflip.    The problem for Democrats is that not only are only 20 states biased towards them, the states that are biased towards Republicans tend to be more biased. Or in other words, they are always going to be the underdogs.  In a national +0 environment, Democrats will average around 46 Senate seats.   In a national +5 environment, around 53 seats.  These are the easy to flip seats.  But in a national +10 environment, Democrats average… still around 54 seats.  +15?  54 seats.  +20?  58 seats.  +25? 58 seats.    It isn’t until we hit a national +30 environment that we see Democrats routinely see Democrats winning more than 60 seats.    This is beyond unrealistic. We haven’t seen a national environment where a generic Democrat polled more than 12 points above a generic Republican in living memory. We’d need nearly triple that for Democrats to win the Senate in a fair election.  So Issue #1: Democrats would need a ridiculously good environment to pass bills  The next problem is that it wouldn’t take just one election. It would take 3, because only one third of Senate seats are up in any specific election.    In that same +30 national environment, the Democrats might only swap 11 seats, going from 47 to 58.  So not only would they need to have a historical rise in support, they’d need to sustain the rise for multiple elections in a row.  This is essentially impossible. The modern election system creates a natural ebb and flow, where parties perform strongest in the Senate as the opposition party in a low-turnout midterm. In other words, a part that makes big gains in a midterm is going to return back to earth in the presidential election after that, and will probably be disadvantaged as the status quo in the midterms after that.  So Issue #2: Democrats would need to sustain a ridiculous environment for 4 to 6 years  The next issue is simple. We *don’t* have free and fair elections. We have elections largely run by states controlled by the GOP, that do everything within their power to rig and sway elections.  This includes taking literally millions off legal and validly registered citizens off voter registries, reducing voting machines in Democratic precincts to increase turnout, and literally dozens of other tactics.  Investigative reporter Greg Palast claims that Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris would have defeated Donald Trump by 1.2 million votes in 2024, if not for widespread voter suppression tactics, in addition to taking the popular vote by 3.5 million votes.  So Issue #3: Democrats would need to convert at levels even above these margins to fight through voter suppression efforts.  Any one of these issues would make it unrealistic to expect a codification of gay marriage rights.  Combined, it is an utter impossibility.  Alternatively, let’s look at the GOP.  In just a +10 national environment, they would average 57 seats. It would only take a little voter suppression from then to garner a supermajority, something they’d be well positioned to accomplish. And they have the alternative path of seizing power in a more autocratic way, something that would be nigh guaranteed to succeed in the US as it currently stands.",ManBearScientist,2025-04-28T14:49:19,5

"I'd say ""pretty unrealistic"" but not ""totally unrealistic."" Assuming the filibuster in the senate hasn't been overturned it would need 60 votes to pass. If you want to get 60 Dems elected the easiest pathway for Dems would be to win two senate elections each in Iowa, Texas, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida and every state more Democratic than those. In other words ""no shot in hell Dems get 60 senators anytime soon.""   The other option would be for Dems to wallop the GOP in a few elections in a row and then Republicans to essentially ""concede"" the issue. You would still need some red state Republicans to vote for it but if gay marriage is over 60% support opposition is hovering around low 30s while the GOP is looking for ways they can show ""moderation"" without angering their donor class then it's conceivable it could pass.",socialistrob,2025-04-28T14:36:46,1

"I think if anyone significantly tampers further with marriage law you are likely going to see states just nuke it from orbit and split it into component parts.  A few of those parts apply to everyone, others only were intended to  apply to biological parents others parents in general.  The parts that apply to everyone were available to everyone without marriage in most states, but it took much more effort and expense without marriage, hence the lawsuits.

"I believe that the debate over who can marry goes back to the fundamental origins of marriage itself.   Throughout history, marriage has taken on many definitions, concepts, and purposes, but one core principle has been present across nearly all civilizations about procreation and the raising of children.  This foundation stretches all the way back to prehistoric times. Even among early tribal societies, long before written law, stable pair-bonding and group structures formed primarily to protect offspring, ensure survival, and pass down resources. Archaeological evidence from early human communities, such as burial sites showing family groupings or shared living spaces, suggests that regulating sexual relationships and securing bloodlines were vital societal functions from humanity’s earliest days.  In today's society, however, the definition of marriage is increasingly being reinterpreted as simply the union of two people, regardless of the potential for biological children.  Traditionalists argue that if a marriage cannot, by its nature, result in procreation, not through adoption or artificial means like uterine transplants, it departs from the historical and natural meaning of marriage.  Procreation is the one foundational element of marriage that has spanned all religions and even predates every known religious system. I believe this reflects a fundamental human value, not merely a religious belief or an expression of bigotry. Humans possess a natural, subconscious instinct to link marriage with the bearing and raising of children, an instinct that has not evolved at the same pace as modern social definitions of marriage.",Balanced_Outlook,2025-04-28T10:59:39,0

"First, ""beyond the church's say-so"" is obviously nonsensical. We can't adjudicate questions of Catholic theology if we refuse to let the catholic church weigh in. The church's say-so, by definition, defines the catholic religion. They determine what makes a wedding catholic or not.  Also by the way, just to avoid things getting too heated, I'm a gay atheist. I have no vested interest in allowing churches to discriminate. This is purely an abstract moral question for me.  Your analogy about Burger King doesn't really work, because gay people are allowed, and often (unfortunately) encouraged, to enter heterosexual marriages in a catholic ceremony. That proves it's the act, and not the person, being objected to.  (And don't say ""but discriminating against gay weddings inherently discriminates against gay people."" Jewish people, by the nature of their identity, want Jewish weddings. There's still a difference between saying ""no Jewish people allowed"" and ""we don't offer that service that Jews want"")  What makes it a catholic wedding is that it follows catholic traditions and catholic law. If the Pope doesn't consider a union kosher, then it's not a valid catholic wedding. (I know I'm oversimplifying catholic doctrine, I hope you get my point.) Some people really value having a ceremony approved by the Pope. If they want that, they can get it, by going to the catholic church. That's the only kind of wedding service they offer.  For example, a catholic church will also (generally speaking, I'm not an expert) refuse to marry divorced people, or people who have expressed an intent to have an open marriage. I know some churches require you to attend their in-house couples counseling. The church offers their opinion on the suitability of your union, that is part of the service they provide.   It's not a one-size-fits-all service like you get at town hall. It's a specific service, for a specific set of customers, and it just so happens that no gay people want that service. No self-respecting gay man owns cargo shorts, but that doesn't make Dickies discriminatory for selling them. (That's a joke, I know not _all_ gay men have taste.)  Now, if there were some general need for catholic weddings, it might make sense to require catholic churches to expand their offerings. If there were a town where, for some reason, the catholic church were the only place one *could* get married, then we should probably force them to accept gay people. We should probably even require them to allow gay weddings to use some of their resources if, for example, they were already in the habit of renting out their chapel for protestant weddings.  But as long as we accept that catholic churches are for catholic weddings, there's no good reason a gay person should _want_ to use them. Gay catholics can either accept that their church disapproves of their happiness, or they can stop being catholic. (Of course the Pope could also decide to announce that homosexuality isn't a sin anymore. I'm sure the church is considering loosening their prohibitions in order to hold onto younger congregants. That's their decision to make, though, just as it's every congregant's decision to remain a congregant or not.)",InterstitialLove,2025-04-29T11:14:45,3
"We are mostly in aggreeance. I really want to stress that im not being antagonistic. I'm clarifying my point to assist future audience and zeitgeist that are not active participants but using our discussion to explain human rights to others in the likely timeline OP mentioned.  What OP is implying with that law is that anyone can practice only parts of a religion and the religious leaders of the religion have to tolerate it,... which is making rulings about how religion is practiced. It's not inclusive or tolerant.  Most major religions were governments at one point. The context they speak in is from the view point of as if it is both culture and state. Because the US was predominantly Christian for so long it doesn't have the legal language of defining a basic marriage, a legal partnership with set consequences and limitations. It's made them up as it's went along with people suing each other.  The US constitution states it holds no religion as a state religion. Im saying the US needs a base law to facilitatethe practice of any religion that makes reference to legally bound marriage, and you are asserting you see it as a Christian privilege to dictate the definition of marriage by calling other formulations ""a free for all""  A marriage contract is simply a public record of responsibility between two or more adults in regard to shared rights.   Not married would be someone not subject to such a contract.  Each religion registered to conduct marriages would provide its preferred contracts.  Each state would have its defined contract for those of no religion. Federal laws would apply to those  contracts but not the religiously definded ones.  Mormons could have thier guy with 7 wives.  Muslims could have thier 4 wives, pending his income assesment.  Catholics could have their monogamous deathbound contracts. Then we get the argument of death.  Protestants our normal marriages with no fault divorces.  A cult leader could be married to all the women of his cult, but then also all of them taking 1 husband.  To be obtuse and point out the problem. You could get something like 1 child having 400 father's and rights of care and inheritance from them.  Each state is then able to issue a contact it deems safe for citizens or public interest.

"You're ignoring the other restrictions catholics place on their weddings. Previously divorced people can't have Catholic weddings. The rule ""only people living in compliance with Catholic teaching can have Catholic weddings"" is enforced with reasonable uniformity.  So there is a standard, you just don't like Catholic theology. Neither do I, which is why I'm not Catholic.  Catholics can practice Catholicism by whatever rules they want. For example, they have bread that they will only ever let other Catholics eat, no matter how much anyone offers to pay for it. ""You're protestant? No bread for you!"" Taken in isolation, that's clearly discrimination, right? But they think the bread is magic, and it belongs to them, and anyone hungry can just eat other bread. Yes, it's silly, but that's what it means to respect their freedom of religion.   They're allowed to believe absurd things as long as they don't hurt anyone else.

If we all stopped using churches for weddings, I doubt the public supply of officiants would be able to keep up, at least not right away.  Again, I don't think it would ever happen, but I would much prefer for churches to serve only a ceremonial role in the marriage process. Everyone should get married at the court house or some other legal office in my opinion.  I think it's the overlooked side of separation of church and state. Merging the two affects the church as much as the state, so keeping them separate allows the church more freedom.

I personally do not view one's religion as an immutable property like race, but the law clearly does. My personal opinion is that people could and should swap or drop their religion just like they do their favorite sports team, but that's just not how we categorize faith as a country.",PinchesTheCrab,2025-04-30T09:24:02,1

">I doubt the public supply of officiants would be able to keep up  You can become a wedding officiant in 5 minutes. Go online, fill out a form, done, you're an officiant. This is not a serious concern.  So to be clear, you aren't concerned about any real practical downsides of the way Catholic churches are performed. Rather, you feel that Americans have the right to be part of any religion they want, and therefore whenever an American is part of a religion that they don't like, the leadership of that religion is obligated to change their theological stance to make the American followers happy.  What if some American, for whatever reason, only likes the Catholic church because it's homophobic?  I actually know a guy like this. He's a conservative Catholic, he hated that Pope Francis was a liberal, but he also hated Catholics who disagree with the Pope. It was hilarious.   But anyways, that guy has a constitutional right to be Catholic. If the Catholic church starts reversing its position on gay people, he could conceivably feel compelled to leave the church. But if it doesn't reverse its position, some gay Catholic might feel so compelled.  So which of them is the Pope constitutionally obligated to please?  The correct answer, for the record, is that your claim that the law views religion as an immutable property like race is just wrong. The law believes that everyone has the right to change their religion, and no one should be able to stop them or force them. But people are allowed to change it, whenever they see fit.   This does not mean that the US government is obligated to ensure that all religions are fun for their congregants.  It's simply false that protected classes have to be immutable. You have a right to be part of any political party you want, a constitutional right very similar to freedom of religion. That doesn't mean parties aren't allowed to change their platforms. It doesn't mean political affiliation is an immutable property like race.  When I was like 15 and deeply closeted, I used to think that the ""gay agenda"" was trying to force me to ""be gay"" just because I happened to be attracted to guys. What, I have to come out of the closet and date men just because ""they"" say that's what teens who can't stop fantasizing about naked guys are supposed to do? They can say ""it's not a choice,"" but I showed them it was a choice by staying in the closet.  Eventually what I realized was that there's a subtle difference between ""it's not a choice"" and ""one of your options is really terrible."" No one was forcing me, they were giving me advice. Those are different.  You can actually stay in the closet forever, but it'll suck. You can be a gay Catholic, but it'll suck. That is advice, not coercion.",InterstitialLove,2025-04-30T10:09:51,1

“But the law prohibits pastors from endorsing candidates during official church functions such as sermons.  Violations can lead to the revocation of a church’s tax-exempt status.  Descriptions of the 20 videos we identified are below. ProPublica and the Tribune had three experts review each of them. They agreed that the cases below violate the law.”  You didn’t read the articles I guess? It’s pretty clear why their tax exempt status should be revoked.,stinkywrinkly,2025-04-28T16:27:00,6

"You are entirely wrong. Not just morally or figuratively but entirely.  https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/charities-churches-and-politics   >The ban on political campaign activity by charities and churches was created by Congress more than a half century ago. The Internal Revenue Service administers the tax laws written by Congress and has enforcement authority over tax-exempt organizations. Here is some background information on the political campaign activity ban and the latest IRS enforcement statistics regarding its administration of this congressional ban.  >In 1954, Congress approved an amendment by Sen. Lyndon Johnson to prohibit 501(c)(3) organizations, which includes charities and churches, from engaging in any political campaign activity. To the extent Congress has revisited the ban over the years, it has in fact strengthened the ban. The most recent change came in 1987 when Congress amended the language to clarify that the prohibition also applies to statements opposing candidates.  >Currently, the law prohibits political campaign activity by charities and churches by defining a 501(c)(3) organization as one ""which does not participate in, or intervene in (including the publishing or distributing of statements), any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office.""  >The IRS has published Revenue Ruling 2007-41 PDF, which outlines how churches, and all 501(c)(3) organizations, can stay within the law regarding the ban on political activity. Also, the ban by Congress is on political campaign activity regarding a candidate; churches and other 501(c)(3) organizations can engage in a limited amount of lobbying (including ballot measures) and advocate for or against issues that are in the political arena. The IRS also has provided guidance regarding the difference between advocating for a candidate and advocating for legislation. See political and lobbying activities.  >Each election cycle, the IRS reminds 501(c)(3) exempt organizations to be aware of the ban on political campaign activity. The IRS published its most recent reminder in a public news release which you can read here.  >The division within the IRS responsible for overseeing churches and charities is the Tax Exempt and Government Entitities Division. TEGE has created a webpage entitled Charities, Churches, and Educational Organizations - Political Campaign Intervention. It is dedicated to the IRS most recent activities related to 501(c)(3) and political activity.  >A definitive court case on the issue of free speech and political expression is Branch Ministries Inc. versus Rossotti PDF. In that case, the court upheld the constitutionality of the ban on political activity. The court rejected the plaintiff church's allegations that it was being selectively prosecuted because of its conservative views and that its First Amendment right to free speech was being infringed.  >The court wrote: ""The government has a compelling interest in maintaining the integrity of the tax system and in not subsidizing partisan political activity, and Section 501(c)(3) is the least restrictive means of accomplishing that purpose.""",Indigo_Sunset,2025-04-29T02:37:27,3
