"Well, dictators know when to not ask too many questions to a bigger, younger dictator. Plus, Trump doesn’t care.  He cares what the younger man’s opinion is of his hairstyle and wealth.",Historical_Bend_2629,2025-04-25T21:28:08,34

Admitting he's defying a court order. He has to learn he can't legally do that. I think he needs to be charged with contempt of court.,invalidpassword,2025-04-26T05:19:48,5

Trump staged the meeting with his fellow dicktator and told him not to send him back. Americans tax dollars are funding the  Concentration prisons in El Salvador,CAM6913,2025-04-26T09:56:33,1
Trump is not going to force his return because that means he has to go against the president of El Salvador who said he will not return an El Salvador citizen to the U.S. when he recently visited Turmp at the White House.,PsychLegalMind,2025-04-25T23:33:17,1
"And he's not going to. Both have already stated the man deported was in the United States illegally.    The whole situation is so dramatic. The error wasn't him being deported it was the where. But instead of saying hey we made a mistake we are working with El Salvador to move him to whatever appropriate situation, they created a huge drama. Even if he did return, he would most likely be deported elsewhere. ",Royalwatching_owl,2025-04-26T06:20:41,-1
Yeah and also the man will within hours probably have endless calls to be interviewed for his experience at CECOT. Exposing it. He will die before they let him leave I think.,Glum_Exchange_5344,2025-04-26T09:29:33,1
"The only way action is taken by the American people is if you rile up middle class white people enough. If they aren’t too fucked to do anything about nothing will happen, no matter what other group steps up. Look at Jan6. They tried raiding the capitol all because they got upset their orange daddy lost. If you can’t get them scared and angry enough you can’t make any headway on any kind of movement.",havokpus,2025-04-26T08:41:09,0
"I honestly believe that the powers that be are scared to indict Trump. People have become dissolussioned as to what a President is, a person, and a person can be corrupt.  That and the Supreme Court granted him ""Absolute Immunity"" and ""The Presumption of Immunity"" so the judges are a little worried as to what will actually happen.  This court was packed by Trump, packed by Republicans and Thomas blatantly takes bribes. They know that a person can be corrupt, they are products of corruption themselves.  The people, however, are considered unprepared for a President committing a crime. After all, it would allow Law Enforcement to arrest any member of government, another aspect of corrupt thinking.  Immunity should never have been granted to anybody, either there's a charge, or there isn't, and there, unfortunately, will be a reckoning to come for those in power that refuse to assent to the law, be it by the People's Hand, or their Creator.  Part of me wishes to pity them, really, but the rest of me is furious.  Biden warned us that the decision would turn the Office of the President into a king. Here, Trump is determining what line needs to be crossed before he can invoke marshal law. What line must he cross to start a civil war?   Hurting the pockets of the middle class? Pissing off billionaires? Flagrant disrespect towards the Constitution of the United States? Deprivations of Rights? He's crossed all these lines, and then some, yet he continues to walk free.  We must, as a people, indict Trump on criminal charges. What needs to happen is that We the People need to find him in Criminal Contempt to show that actions taken were willfully illegal. That action scares the judiciary because nobody knows what he's going to do in response, and there's the high likelihood that Vance will just pardon him anyway. The judiciary has grown far to comfortable making policy decision instead of interpreting the law as it is written. The Supreme Court has not, historically, been the best at discerning Fair and Impartial.  I will admit they've had their moments, granting the people public defenders being one of my favorites, they've also had moments I disagree with because their actions erode the rights of the People, like granting Legislative Immunity just before the Civil War and the Jim Crow era that follows.   Granting ""Absolute Immunity,"" for any reason, should never have been done. Granting ""The Presumption of Immunity?"" Spits in the face of every American Citizen. It was not fair, nor was it impartial, but instead a nod to the powerful who normally are able to civer up their bull.  Contempt of Court, is exactly what we need, it covers the base of Presumptive Immunity by stating in no uncertain terms that the action taken was deamed illegal by the judiciary. Furthermore, it must be in a case that deals with a person's Rights, such as the Constitutional Right to Due Process. Why? Because ANY government official can be implicated in the Deprivation of Rights Under Color of Law, the 1964 Civil Rights Act does not carve out an exception, and it is a very broad law, yet only applies to the deprivations of Rights and Privaledges. Constitutional Rights specifically have an Oath Sworn that garuntees the jurisprudence of a textualist understanding at minimum.  There is no excuse for Trump, or his regime, for violating a court order demanding that a person is afforded their Constitutional Rights. It is a Capital Offense, depending on circumstance, for instance, if someone dies, which they have.  We the People of the United States have the necessity of Contempt of Court in order to break free from the shackles of tyranny through the Juduciary body. The judiciary body has the power to find probable cause for willful, premeditated Contempt through previous statements by this regime. I would like to remind you that ""administrators"" have previously stated that they WILL disobey ""Unconstitutional"" Court Orders.",BananasAndAHammer,2025-04-26T15:52:29,3

You’re talking to someone who has either fallen for or is pretending to fall for this bullshit tale of “I won’t send him back against President Trump’s wishes” and then Trump saying “I won’t ask Bukele to send him back because he’s already said he won’t do it”  Either way they’re not really worth talking to.,specqq,2025-04-26T04:09:46,1
