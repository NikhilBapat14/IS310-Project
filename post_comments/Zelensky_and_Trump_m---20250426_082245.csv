The amount of patience Zelensky has dealing with our idiot of a president truly shows how much he cares for the people in his country.,CouchCorrespondent,2025-04-26T08:35:07,20

First thing Zelensky should have said is that it is hugely disrespectful for Trump to come to the Pope's funeral dressed in blue.,crazybones,2025-04-26T09:26:12,3
"Meeting with Trump is essentially the same as meeting with Putin.  There is simply no daylight between Trump and Putin when it comes to threatening and abusing smaller nations.  It’s kind of like a Hitler/Mussolini relationship.       Trump’s demands for ending the war are identical to Putin’s demands for complete Ukrainian capitulation, exactly as you would expect.",Beantown-Jack,2025-04-26T08:34:59,2
"15 minutes is an awfully short meeting to reach an understanding, so it is difficult to be hopeful particularly in light of the fact a second one expected for Saturday was cancelled. Unless there are additional talks and or details about what exactly was agreed to, this does not change much of anything.",PsychLegalMind,2025-04-26T09:01:37,1
"And the headline should read, Trump steps for in a church. Chapels on golf courses don't count.",western-Equipment-18,2025-04-26T09:11:43,1
