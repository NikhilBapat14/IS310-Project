Crushing anti-Trump wins are my favorite kind.   [The Guardian article which is the source of the screen shot in the meme.](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/03/australia-election-anthony-albanese-labor-party-peter-dutton)  Results are still coming in and may take a day or two to be complete. But the Australian Labor Party (ALP) could end up with as many as 90 seats in the Australian House of Representatives. That's the equivalent of Dems winning 261 seats in the US House of Representatives.,clamorous_owle,2025-05-03T13:11:01,38

"From what I understand, there's a few countries that are trying to copy the MAGAt style of tyranny and facsism. Some are even wanting to have their own versions of Elon Musk, to root out the ""fraud, waste, and abuse"".

"No, you forgot that the boss of Fox, Rupert Murdoch is a former Aussie and his influence is VERY prominent here. We got ""Sky News Australia"" as the Fox here and the majority of print media are Murdoch media.
