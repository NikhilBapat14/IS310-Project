"I'm so tired of Trump's ignorance, stupidity and vanity.  He's so ridiculous.",NorthenFreeman,2025-05-02T13:15:05,75
"# Donald Trump has announced that the US is to strip mention of Europe out of its annual celebration of victory in the Second World War.  The president said that the [May 8](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/ve-day-nation-celebrated-pictures/) Victory in Europe Day ([VE Day](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/04/19/pub-opening-extension-ve-day-80th-anniversary-toast-end-war/)) will become “Victory Day for World War Two”. Russia also uses Victory Day to celebrate the end of the war.  The US will also recognise the defeat of the Germans in 1918 as “Victory Day for World War One”, scrapping the title of Armistice Day.  Mr Trump appeared to downplay the role of European forces in defeating Nazism, saying “we won both Wars, nobody was close to us in terms of strength, [bravery, or military brilliance](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/04/06/usa-nato-leave-trump-defence-spending/)”.  “We are going to start celebrating our victories again!” the president added.  The entry of the US in the [Second World War](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/second-world-war/) turned the tide against the Nazi forces, with General George S Patton’s soldiers joining other allied forces in surging up through southern Italy before the [D-Day landings](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/d-day-normandy-landings-interviews/) in Normandy.  But [VE Day](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/telegraph-covered-ve-day-1945/) was named as such to reflect the fact that US and British troops fought on in the Pacific until VJ Day, or Victory over Japan Day, on August 14 1945.",Hazer_123,2025-05-02T13:12:25,25

"""In Nazi Germany, several holidays were altered to align with Nazi ideology. Christmas was rebranded as Julfest, emphasizing its Germanic origins and downplaying Christian connotations.

"What an utter twat. To simply dismiss the sacrifices many European men and women made fighting the Nazis is beyond disrespectful. I certainly wouldn't ignore American efforts when it came to WW2.   I would think many veterans still alive today would be livid as they likely fought bravely alongside their British and French counterparts and saw one another as brothers in arms, not this petty point scoring bullshit Trump is so eager to put out there.    I hope he gets called out on this",FreakinSweet86,2025-05-03T02:39:48,2

"Is this actually true though? And it’s sort of a weird dynamic as it was a world war, but it was mostly a European war started in and by Europe nations, and ended in Europe.  The US provided funding and industrial output and the UK provided intelligence, and UK intelligence agencies are largely acknowledged to have been even more instrumental in securing shipping that was publicly acknowledged at the time because they had broken ciphers and obviously didn’t disclose this, and so other European involvement often depended on the US/UK to direct them.  Interestingly the US and Russia were obviously both instrumental in the end of WW2, and they’re now both apparently the “enemies”.  Germany had u-boats that would sink even commercial/non-military ships in the Atlantic, and so the US deployed large fleets of subs and ships to combat this.  The UK also had a large naval presence, and so the US/UK were the largest factors in keeping shipping lanes and commerce flowing. I don’t think most European countries really participated in this to the same scale and some didn’t participate at all, and some cases were aligned with the Nazi party and so some European countries were on both sides.  The US/UK were also the largest participants in the Berlin airlifts and so again it was mostly the US/UK with one or two others serving as hubs.  A lot of the European efforts were highly integrated with and directed by US/UK forces and intelligence efforts, and could not have operated without them.",SomeYak5426,2025-05-03T08:09:53,-2
