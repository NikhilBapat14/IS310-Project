Whatever pops into his addled brain at the moment is the reality the rest of us have to navigate. What a way to do business.,FlintBlue,2025-05-09T07:07:02,9
"I'd prefer he used a dartboard to pick the tariff rate.  It would have exactly as much thought behind it, but the maximum number would be lower.",specqq,2025-05-09T07:09:24,3
I don’t understand why trump would reduce the tariff amount if they were this amazing thing that’ll make America rich again and the tariffed country is the one who ‘eats’ the amount?,rm11217,2025-05-09T07:12:22,3

Trump’s spine seems to have completely dissolved. He just sits slumped over a desk or table with his head a few inches off the surface.,ranchoparksteve,2025-05-09T07:36:32,2
Not good enough. It'd be nice if we could get the crashing of the US economy limited to two or three weeks rather than the rest of my life.,CT_Phipps-Author,2025-05-09T07:29:17,1
"Anticipating your antagonist's reaction, then having the next step in mind ready to go is strategic thinking in geopolitics. This is not that, because step one was not even considered - the mouth just flapped, and noise came out of it. And it will not work out well for him, again.",steve_ample,2025-05-09T08:17:55,1

"It's probably just market manipulation. In spite of the tariffs, the market continues to grow which shows a disassociation between margins and stock prices. He understands he can have a large effect through adjusting consumer sentiment with the tariffs causing fluctuations that allow him and his allies to profit off buying dips.  Sad that we've come to the point that market growth continues in spite of the actual conditions it operates under and that only mass panic leads to general losses.",ThatSandwich,2025-05-09T11:01:33,1
