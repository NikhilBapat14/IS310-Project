"The Times article errs in calling those being sent to Libya ""deportees"". They are not. When you ""deport"" someone, that means you put them on a plane to their native country, where they are released and are free to do as they choose. I won't even go into the laws involving those seeking asylum from danger in their native country, as many of those being sent have never set foot in Libya nor any connection to that country.  What the Trump administration is doing is sending people to concentration camps on foreign soil. Most of those being sent never committed any crime, and none of them were given any type of hearing. It is likely they will never be seen or heard from again.  In the spring of 1940, the German government setup a prison in Oświęcim in occupied Poland to hold ""detainees"":  >  That town and the newly built prison were renamed ""Auschwitz"".  I defy anyone to explain to me how what the Trump administration is doing is *any different* than what the Nazis did in that spring of 1940.",youreallcucks,2025-05-07T00:16:11,9

"Let’s stop feeding the narcissistic machine. Every time we use the T-word, we boost the brand of someone who wants us to obsess over him good or bad. Instead, let’s starve the algorithm. Rename him, deflate him, mock him, or better yet: erase his cultural dominance by refusing to say his name at all. Call him  DRUMPF, the Not-So-Great Pumpkin, Donnie Two-Scoops, Agent Orange, the Fauxphet, Cheeto Caesar, the Bronze Calf, Baron of Bankruptcy, or just The Former Guy.

"The Nazis built their first camps in 1933, and there were literally more than a *thousand* camps all across Germany and the occupied territories.   Dachau, Sachsenhausen and Buchenwald are three of the best known concentration camps, and they are very much in Germany, and Dachau remained in operation all the way from 1933 -1945.   There were a whole bunch of camps throughout Germany, though not all of them were strictly called concentration camps.   The Nazis actually differentiated between forced-labor-camps, transit camps, concentration camps, and killing centers, though they were all the same horrifying hell holes.   Fun fact: some of the sites of the Nazi concentration camps were previously used as POW camps during WW1.   Yeah, there were definitely camps on home soil.",NihilisticPollyanna,2025-05-07T07:20:25,6
