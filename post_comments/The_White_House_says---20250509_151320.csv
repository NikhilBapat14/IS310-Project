"The first court hearing is in four days, so I'm going to say that it is actually not here to stay and we are about to witness the biggest crash out in history.",Prestigious-Ad54,2025-05-09T15:15:32,32
"Jesus if I'm a Democrat my campaign is I will take away the Trump 10% sales tax! That's the whole campaign. Hell I'd even say when asked about other things ""that's all that matters! The working people are over taxed""",Faucet860,2025-05-09T15:17:38,38

"Sooooo…..now we’re back to the terrible place you put us in after you came to office, but it’s SOOO much better than yesterday, so now it looks “good” by comparison?

"**TLDR:**  * **Trump's 10% baseline tariff on nearly all countries is not going anywhere, the White House says.** * **Since they were first announced on April 2, Trump's sweeping tariffs have disrupted markets and supply chains globally. Since then, Trump has made a number of changes to his tariff policies.** * **Earlier this week, Trump flatly said ""no"" when asked if he would consider lowering his tariffs on China. But on Friday, Trump appeared to contradict himself, suggesting in a Truth Social post that the Chinese tariff could be lowered to 80%.**",thisisinsider,2025-05-09T15:14:03,5

"Gosh, I have been spending too much time on economy/investing subs.  When you said crash out I was confused.  It helps to know which sub I am on.   For the record I don’t think the courts will rule against Trump.  If they do, the SCOTUS has a very expansive view of presidential power.  They will likely rule in favor Trump.",Hot_Frosting_7101,2025-05-09T21:13:56,2

"It's also going to hurt some groups who really wouldn't expect it.   A host of key raw inputs, partially prepared inputs, and some specialised machinery or bleeding edge technology America imports for manufacturing value added goods is going to become more expensive, making American manufacturing less efficient and cost effective. Half of what America manufactures it sells overseas, and those export products are going to be considerably less competitive on the global market.   When you increase the costs of things workers need to buy, you increase your labour costs. This further makes your products and services less competitive.   So some middle class trade and professional groups are going to be hit pretty hard by these tariffs.   The steel and aluminium tariffs in particular are going to be brutal for American automotive and aeronautic engineering. Boeing and Tesla were already struggling. These tariffs could be lethal.  And let's not even get into what the responding tariffs are going to do to a host of American sectors, especially agriculture, food and beverages.",Le1bn1z,2025-05-09T16:19:35,1
"Well, it's looking pretty great if you are the 1% wealthy or somebody that Trump gave a job to that is completely under qualified. Everyone else can just suck a nut globally.",Quiet-Type-,2025-05-09T16:38:06,1
"And the supreme court will strike it down just like they struck down Biden's vaccine mandate. I wouldn't be surprised if it's 9-0 against Trump, the only question is how far they will go in invalidating the laws that allowed this insanity in the first place.",Prestigious-Ad54,2025-05-09T15:22:30,6
Honestly I'd cut the above a percentage above part because people think it trickles down. Sadly uneducated. Now I would just keep it bland I'll raise capital gains taxes on the Uber rich!  The uneducated don't know capital gains and some people think they are rich but not Uber rich.,Faucet860,2025-05-09T15:23:36,2
Thinking that Alito and Thomas will join with that ruling eh? You have more faith in “judges” to do the lawful thing than I do.,CadetNoob,2025-05-09T18:54:40,4
Alito and Thomas are old school conservatives and they are 100% going to smack this down.,Prestigious-Ad54,2025-05-09T19:04:38,-2
"I could be wrong. But thinking that Alito and Thomas would do anything to slow down the right wing authoritarian that they’ve given full immunity to, seems like wishful thinking. 5-4 with Robert’s splitting would be my guess.",CadetNoob,2025-05-09T19:06:44,7
