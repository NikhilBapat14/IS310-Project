"North Korea vibes.   Plus they've learned to speak as superlatively as their King  >talk to Donald Trump’s most faithful supporters and you will hear them use words such as “amazing”, “fantastic” and “ecstatic” about his presidency  And then this from one supporter  >The 60-year-old added: “He’s done what he promised he’d do in the campaign, which is far and away different from most politicians. Like it or not, he’s doing what he said he would do and that’s all anybody can ask for.”   Apparently, this guy can read the tea leaves that are Trump's words and has decipher them to be true. Even with no real plan ever mentioned or put in place to base it off of. Unless he simply means hurt the minorities. Either way, What a marvelous gift to have /s",AssociateGreat2350,2025-05-02T11:49:24,22

You must make economic sacrifices for the leader. Poverty is a test to show how much you love the leader.,30mil,2025-05-02T11:56:29,10
"Well yea, if I was a racist asshole and/or an evangelical Christian I love Trump. I’d be upset with his economic policies but I’d be loving his social policies.  It doesn’t take a political genius to see how the Christian right is enjoying this right now. They’ve been begging for an administration like this for years.",hmr0987,2025-05-02T12:09:40,7
"Yeah.  There is a mindset of trauma and indoctrination that runs deep in this country.  If he abuses my little brother, well, at least I am o.k.  And my little brother probably deserved it.

Trump churches will pop up the day of his funeral. His kids will claim to channel him and they will start a new form of Christianity that somehow works Trump into the divine text. They’ll pray to him *and* Jesus.,KommieKon,2025-05-02T14:16:10,4
I can guarantee you that millions of Trump voters (if not tens of millions) will drink poisoned flavor aid if Trump asked them and told them it will hurt all the out-group people more than it hurts them.,AdventurerBKRB,2025-05-02T12:22:54,7
