"“The United States was more than just a nation. It’s a brand. It’s a universal brand”  Who the hell talks like this? It’s so gross it makes you feel like you’re gonna vomit in your mouth. I don’t give a shit about branding, I just want to live in a country where people can afford to go to the doctor and not be ripped off the street and sent to death camps because of the shade of their skin color.",no_kids-and-3_money,2025-04-24T15:08:38,6

"Like it or not, branding is what makes or breaks political and social movements. Obama had an amazing brand. Democrats crapped on the rebranding. MAGA had an amazing brand (not in terms of morals but influence). The GOP has been able to constantly work against the interests of their constituents because their brand was telling everyone ABC while they were in the background doing 123.   Affording doctors? Look at how much support trended upwards when it went from Obamacare to ACA. That’s branding.   Branding is powerful and the US brand being degraded on a global scale should terrify everyone.   We dont have to like it, but we should know about it so we can realize how it is being used against us and how we can use it to make the changes we want to see.",Gonnagremlin,2025-04-24T19:02:55,3
