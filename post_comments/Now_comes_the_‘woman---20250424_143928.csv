"A lot of other people, including PC writers at the Guardian, mocked Katy Perry, Gayle King and Lauren S√°nchez‚Äôs brief flight to space.  Bad example.  And here's a stunner: ""swimmer turned anti-transgender activist Riley Gaines"": dishonest character assassination.  Gaines opposes the grossly unfair advantage that former male swimming stars have when they decide to declare themselves trans women and compete against women in swimming event.  think about it: current women's mile world record holder in track Faith Kipyegon of Kenya, plans a high-tech assault on the 4-minute mile.  Her current women's world record is 4:07.64.  She's the fastest woman in the world.  Meanwhile, **Twenty-five U.S. high school boys have run the mile in less than four minutes since 1964**, some more than once. Twenty-one of them have accomplished the feat since 2015.

The christo-fascist right wing wants a single ‚Äúfamily vote‚Äù to belong to the male head of  every household. All others in the family would be bound to his wishes.
