"In a time when politics is all doom and gloom, this is a fun bit of political fuckery. The city hired a private investigator to follow members of their own council to their out of city homes.   To run for office, you need to live in the city so this would disqualify them, and both are running for reelection with one considering a mayoral run.  This is classic oppo research, though having the city hire a PI is overkill. Leak this info to the media and let them run with it, then you investigate and take your political enemies down.  The reaction was epic, too.  ""Tearing up a stack of papers, Musa shouted at the investigator while slamming his hands on the table: ""I've been a councilman for more than a decade. I disagree for the investigation and I'll see you in the court, definitely.""""  Yeah, that's how an innocent person reacts to an accusation. Dude knew he was cooked.",travio,2025-05-01T22:30:20,5
