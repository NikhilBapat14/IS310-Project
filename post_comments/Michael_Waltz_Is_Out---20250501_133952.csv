"Trump's approach is to get others to do his dirty work, then throw them under the bus and wash his hands of them when it is convenient.  The first 100 days have not gone well.  Musk and Waltz are just the first.  One has to wonder who will get blamed for the trade tariff fiasco.  Obviously, we can't blame Trump, as he is never at fault for anything.",I405CA,2025-05-01T13:56:22,3

Clearly Linda McMahon will be at fault because the department of education failed to teach people how tariffs work.,Fif112,2025-05-01T14:16:21,2
