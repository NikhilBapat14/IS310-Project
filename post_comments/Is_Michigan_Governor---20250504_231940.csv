She literally saved thousand of jobs and therefore families in her state. She did her job. She did it better than most governors. At the end of the day she knows how to keep her state from collapsing and if it means she eats shit a few times then she will do that. Because she is a rock star who...once again saved thousands of Michigan jobs.  Performing dramatic rage online as it means losing thousand of jobs for the state you're supposed to be running is not very useful. It's emotional. Giving trump the finger might feel good for a bunch of idiots who stand to lose nothing but she's much better than that.   She didn't elect the lunatic. She's just saving her people as best she can from the lunatic by offering him candy.,All_is_a_conspiracy,2025-05-05T01:39:27,352
"I think criticizing her for helping her constituents without some sort of clear concession to Trump is super unhelpful. Her job is to help the people of Michigan, AFAIK, she is trying to do that and doesn't seem to be bending the knee in any way.",CyberDalekLord,2025-05-04T23:31:51,226
"It seems Trump is purposely trying to make her look bad. When she met with the President he invited the press after and she was stuck there in the oval office as he did his thing.   Then when she met him on the tarmack, she shook his hand and he pulled her in to a hug that she was not planning on and was forced on her. Trump knows what he is doing. He wants to work with her while doing things to marginalize her with voters.",radicalindependence,2025-05-05T04:16:17,14

Republicans won't vote for impeachment, there is no one coming to save us because no one can. The voters made our bed and now Whitmer has to make the best of it.",rendeld,2025-05-04T23:35:55,23
"I’ll bite and go against the current of this sub. The criticism of Whitmer isn’t that she helped her constituents, no one is mad about that. What we’re angry about is her allowing herself to be used as a political pawn. People are saying she’s just playing politics yet in politics optics matter. And when you’re on camera hugging on the guy who is gleefully trying to take away due process rights, destroying our government, ruining our economy, and alienating our Allies it’s going to leave an orange stain on you. Larry David’s “Dinner with Hitler” applies here. When you make a deal with the devil you’re selling your soul.   She could have declined attending the event or merely not got on stage like she had planned and none of this would have been an issue. Again, it’s not that she did something for her constituents, it that she allowed herself to be used as a prop.

"Any decisions to disqualify Whitmer for 2028 over her actions to help her **current** constituents stems from hyper-partisanship, which helps absolutely nobody, and likely conservative funded propaganda. Dems will become their own worst enemy if they start turning on everyone who isn't excessively or needlessly hostile to the opposition.    The reality is politics is a complex game that sometimes means shaking hands and cordially greeting someone you may have condemned just days before. ",TheMadTemplar,2025-05-05T00:01:37,15

"The problems with these comparisons with Obama that it's completely artificial and is missing the context. One of the things that Trump loves to do is that he likes to punish his enemies and force them to work with him to get want he wants.  Janet Mills got punished for opposing him by cutting medicaid. But that didn't stop her from fighting back, and winning in court.   All of this does is create the same culture that is enabling Trump to do what he wants because politicans fear getting attacked. Democrat Voters do not want Governors/Democrat Congressmen to be yesmen to Trump.   They want Politicians that will vote to overturn tariffs, fight back against Trump.  I think that's pretty reasonable. Remember Volodymyr Zelenskyy didn't kiss Trump's ass despite him needing US's resources, but he still didn't let his country love their values.   Meanwhile, Chris Christie working with Obama made sense because it was a disaster, Christie had a very smart bid to get a second term by swinging moderate votes.",bot4241,2025-05-06T04:21:25,2

"Chuck Schumer and like 5 Senate Dems saved the country from a government shutdown maybe like a month and some change ago.  The Media largely ignored this because Trump is the all consuming force in our lives, The right isn't giving them any credit because why would they, the left is hating them for it as they should ,and in sum, they simply ended up looking weak, and scared of Trump and MAGA, even after saving Trump and MAGA the embarassment of having a Gov't shutdown in his first 60 or so days.  Schumers reasoning was I guess somewhat solid. He claimed he didn't want to see the people get hurt by a govt shutdown in the midst of Elon's DOGE cuts. Ignoring the fact the those same people were being devastated by DOGE anyway.  I understand the analysis of ""she had to do what she had to do"" to keep her people working, and to keep her state functioning, but she caved, she bent the knee. She negotiated with- rather flattered, the arsonist who was lighting her state and the country on fire, and in the end, she will likely get none of the credit, and all of the smoke for this.  Whitmer is emblematic of precisely what's wrong with democrats. They're playing the old game. The game that no longer works and no longer wins. It's also what poll after poll has shown the people don't want anymore.  They want someone to pound the table and call this bullshit out. They want fighters. not people who cave to the terrorist who's holding our economy hostage.  Even more so, Whitmer, like Newsom, like Harris, like Schumer don't really stand for anything anymore. Right after she bent the knee publicly to Trump twice, once at the White House, and again at one of his Klan rallies, she ran to the Pod Save America podcast to call Trump a threat to democracy. Which is it Gretch?  IF you're going by the logic of l'm Trying to save Michiganders from these bat shit tariffs then stand on your decision to bend the knee. Don't mushy mouth it, don't both sides it, but don't expect any credit from any side. I guarantee if you went to a ford plant right now and asked the line level guy who's saving them right now they'd probably give Trump the credit.

"Whitmer didn't do herself any favors with how she handled the situation at the White House or when meeting Trump. If anything, she is guilty of bad PR. I wouldn't have been grinning from ear to ear, but she should have held her head high and owned it. If anything, I ding her for not being more self-aware in the moment without her handlers there telling her what to do. Maybe she isn't as strong a candidate as I previously thought.  Her job isn't representative of the Democratic party or future presidential candidate. She's the current governor of Michigan, who happens to be a Democrat. Obviously, she has to have one eye on her political future, but she needs to focus on delivering for the people of her state. As someone living in another purple state with a Dem governor who we'll likely see in the 2028 primaries, the last thing I want is for my governor to make themselves the public face of the Trump opposition movement.

Thank you.

"It’s a hard call and why I think the unique nature of this Presidency matters. If Trump stays on his current path of trampling Constitutional rights and starts arresting more judges and politicians and depriving people of due process; are the economic benefits of the deal worth the legitimization of his Presidency through cooperation? Like how does this look if the base starts being used to deport people to foreign prisons without due process. If Trump was not a threat to the Republic this would be far more similar to the Chris Christie situation but instead it feels more like a Neville Chamberlain moment.  It’s also about future optics as well. It’s well and good that Whitmer has done right by her constituents here (and it might be the right move for the short-term) but that hug will be replayed over and over again when she has to campaign next. She doesn’t need to be adversarial with Trump, but the optics of how it all went down read as capitulation instead of a cordial working relationship between opposed figures.   It depends on how the electorate moves forward: Will they reward continued bipartisanship or will the party find itself unable to find the votes by alienating the left-wing of the party that doesn’t want bipartisanship with a party they see as a threat to democracy itself?
