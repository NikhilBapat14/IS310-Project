Those who play with fire will get burned. This man is an imminent danger to himself and others.   Allowing a person with a toddler's mentality to randomly set fires for fun is a game that is going to end in tradgedy. Those who are failing to take the matches out of this child's hand are culplable for the inferno that will result.,ahfoo,2025-05-03T00:28:20,2

Crazy thing about billionaires is even if they lose a ton of money they're still billionaires. Like Muskrat could lose 99.735% of his entire net worth and still be a billionaire.,Crying_Reaper,2025-05-02T20:50:09,14

Crazy thing about billionaires is that they always want to get more. Losing is not something they enjoy,AleroRatking,2025-05-02T20:50:43,0
The thing is you‚Äôre wrong. They won‚Äôt be harmed. They‚Äôre the real beneficiaries. Whole the delusional trump supporters think trumps fixing all the corruption and gonna help them what he‚Äôs doing is rolling back all their protections and making it easier for billionaires to make more billions. Take musk for example hes losing tesla but gaining hugely more than that in starlink defense contracts and all. Bezos and zuckerberg are getting what they want too. All the while morons are being convinced democrat congress idiot playing the stock market to their advantage or some trans kid are the real crime.,Twodogsonecouch,2025-05-03T09:28:37,1
"Crazy thing about being harmed, is that means damage or injury. Billionaires only being able to afford 2 mega yachts instead of 30 isn‚Äôt really gonna hurt them.   Oh no, they‚Äôre really going to have to change their lifestyles. So much harm to billionaires.",JewsieJay,2025-05-02T23:58:30,-1
They will absolutely be harmed. They will be the ones who lose the most money with tariffs. They are just also the most equipped to recover.,AleroRatking,2025-05-03T09:34:46,1
