"Lots of people will hear Marx and start ""debunking"" labor theory of value, rate of declining profit, and so on.  And a lot of Marxists will man the barricades and argue back.  This misses the point about Marx.  Marxian analysis comes down to one basic idea: the motor of history is class struggle (""Marxian"" is used rather than ""marxist"" as ""Marxian"" is less loaded).  Roughly speaking, Marxian approach for a period of time (past or present) is to identify what are the social relations of production.  In a capitalist system, it is wage labor - production happens when a laborer sells his/her labor-time to a capitalist, in exchange for wage.  In the feudal era, the social relation of production was the peasant paying the lord a certain chunk of agricultural produce and/or labor-time (oversimplifying here).  These relations of production, for Marx, all have internal contradictions.  For example, capitalist tends to create a large class of people who live off wages, and a smaller class of people who own the means of production (ie a factory - frequently ""means of production"" is synonymous with ""capital"", ie capital \~ factory parts \~ means of production).  Being humans, the masses of workers will not be so happy, they will struggle to better their position (ie unionizing, striking, slow-downs, etc), and the boss will fight back (union-busting, workplace surveillance, etc).  Socialists, to varying degrees, were aware of this before Marx (that is, we don\`t need to discuss Marxian theories of labor theory or declining profit yet).  The struggle to resolve these internal contradictions, Marx argues, concludes in the triumph of a new mode of production.  For example, capitalism emerges in the context of early bourgeois, peasant, and lords struggling amongst each other.  This observation is key to understanding Marxian analysis of history and contemporary politics.  You might say ""there is more to life than your job!  How can this be a complete description of history/society?""  Well, Marx, and many Marxists, were not so dumb.  The social relations of production are a starting reference point, the kernel from which other social relations can be understood (and the social relations of production are not necessarily purely economic).  Thus, you get scholarship such as the British Marxist Historians, who look at how culture, politics, religion, and so on relate with this aforementioned class struggle, and how class struggle feeds back in.  For example, in early US history, a kind of hysterical, zealous evangelism (ie Antinomianism) was associated with rural areas, resisting market penetration.  It is impossible to understand religion here purely on its own terms, and the issue clearly lends itself to a Marxian interpretation (not to say other interpretations are not possible...)  So then, you often hear people arguing over ""labor theory of value"" and ""declining profit"" and all of this good old Marxist jargon.  I will not engage with this debate itself.  Instead, I want to contextualize the place of this terminology.  Marx identifies each mode of production as having inherent contradictions (ie capitalism creating a class of wage laborers, who will then struggle against capitalist interests), and the development of said mode of production could be understood through said internal contradictions.  The project of Marx's ""*Capital*"" is, in part, to analyze these contradictions in  capitalism.  Of course, it does a lot more.  But these ideas (ie ""labor theory of value"") appear in this context of his analysis of capitalism, by radically re-interpreting old theories (labor theory of value comes from Adam Smith, John Locke, and Ricardo) in service of criticizing capitalism.  The problem Marx has had is that Marx has become part of the state ideology of several countries, two very prominent ones being the USSR and the PRC.  It is not surprising that he has been interpreted dogmatically as a result.  I will not get into the politics of the Cold War and all that, but needless to say, that dogmatism manifests on the left is fairly evident.  Any good Marxist should be critical of this (he himself stated he did not consider himself a ""Marxist"").  Marx shouldn\`t be interpreted simply as a prophet.  He is a political thinker/historian/philosopher.  Like many political thinkers and historians, we should not expect of him to be 100% correct all of the time.  Many Marxians and Marxists have developed his ideas, criticized his ideas, and so on.  And many disagree amongst themselves.  His concept of the ""Asiatic Mode of Production"" is one of the more obvious examples of a concept criticized within Marxist discourse, and there has been a lot of discussion over if ""original \[primitive\] accumulation"" only happens before capitalism, or also during.  Instead, we should take a more Plato-inspired approach: utilize his method (identify relations of production, identify contradictions and struggles, etc), and look to his work for insight.  In a similar way, Plato gives a method (the Socratic method, dialogue), and a lot of theories in his Dialogues.  Furthermore, Plato was wrong about just about everything - but that doesn\`t mean his theories are garbage (well, some of them are :P).  His theory of the Forms is still insightful, imo!  Edit: and more to the point, the socratic method is the backbone of a lot of how we approach knowledge acquisition, despite Plato being wrong (for lack of a better term) (although not to say this idealist Socratic inheritance is taken unmodified or uncritically!)  Marx\`s work should also not be so quickly discarded.  He was no idiot, and a lot of what he has to say is still relevant.  &#x200B;  Edit: Its worth noting that Marx planned to formulate and write some books on the state and politics.  He died before doing that however, and so many Marxists will point out that his critiques of political economy are not the complete picture he wanted.  I would check out ""Whats Left of Marxism"" (published by De Gruyter) for more insight.  Picking up any old Marxist book (ie Capital) is great and all, but it might not discuss exactly what you are looking for (or in the case of Capital - you may get bogged down, tbh)",Sugbaable,2022-12-05T15:48:31,16
"Basically any time we talk about how capitalism is dehumanizing, pits people artificially against each other and prioritizes the accumulation of wealth in the hands of the few over the health and happiness of the many, we’re quoting Marx.  “The less you eat, drink and read books; the less you go to the theatre, the dance hall, the public house; the less you think, love, theorize, sing, paint, fence, etc., the more you save-the greater becomes your treasure which neither moths nor dust will devour-your capital. The less you are, the more you have; the less you express your own life, the greater is your alienated life-the greater is the store of your estranged being.”",9d47cf1f,2022-12-05T11:06:00,23

"There are subreddits such as r/Socialism_101 (and a whole laundry list of others), since your question is a historical one you might also want to check out r/AskHistorians (etc)  My 2 Cents though...  1) Karl Marx directly influenced what is known as ""[Social History](https://www.britannica.com/topic/social-history)""  While social history is still used, its limitations helped to lead to the creation of what is now called ""[cultural history](https://culturahistorica.org/what-is-historical-culture/)"".  BOTH Social History and Cultural History are still in use, they are just different frameworks used to analyze history.  2) Marx underestimated a few things...  a) The influence of ethnic/racial/etc lines which both unify and divide people. For example see how in the U.S. how White Workers would rather side with White Business Owners than side with non-White Workers.  b) How Robust Capitalism would be when critiqued and attacked. Marx did not seem to expect Capitalisms to be able to adapt and defend itself as well as it has.

"Wow, thank you very much for your detailed and illuminating response to my question. First allow me to summarize what you wrote to be sure I grasp it:  1. The motor that moves history is class struggle. Class struggle can be understood through examining who owns the means of production, and how other social classes relate to this. There are inherent contradictions in these social relations, and it is these contradictions which give rise to new means of production.  2. I was told that later in his life Marx articulated beyond communism (as it was understood and implemented last century) as the direction history will go as the means of production evolves. However, this is not the Marx people know of today. The popular view is a dogmatic one and this muddied the water on Marxist and Marxian thinking.   Thanks for the recommendation ""What's Left of Marxism."" I will read that and avoid ""Capital"" for now.  Interestingly, you are probably familiar with Fukuyama whose essay ""The End of History"" caused quite a stir. He used it to state that democracy is essentially the end of history, as I imagine you already understood. Is there some credible consensus about the future of political and economic development given the inherent contradictions in our present model, or are we truly at the end of history?  Separately, I'm wondering if you could elaborate more on your thoughts of Plato.

">Class struggle can be understood through examining who owns the means of production, and how other social classes relate to this. There are inherent contradictions in these social relations, and it is these contradictions which give rise to new means of production.  You're getting there...  1. ""Owns the means of production"" makes sense in a capitalist system - the means of production (ie a factory) is property.  In a feudal system, ""ownership"" is not as clear.  The issue is how people relate via the social means of production.  A peasant is expected to give some of his/her produce (or labor time), and the lord is entitled to this portion.  In a Marxian analysis, this relationship plays a fundamental role in how a society evolves over time.  Different factors might enter the picture - new tech, new colonies, new ideas, etc - but understanding how society evolves necessarily requires understanding what ""the motor of history"" is (ie class struggle).  There is a lot of variability here though - is the struggle between peasant and lord the the characteristic one?  How about the struggle between lords and proto-bourgeois (ie a person exchanging commodities for market value, rather than for their feudal duty; this is a vague definition, and Marxists have debates here).  Some **key Marxist questions** (in **more common language**, although ""exploit"" has Marxist connotations, it does the job in its common meaning here) for a mode of production are ""**who is being exploited**"", ""**who is exploiting**"", ""**what is the form of exploitation**"", and  **""Does exploitation happen on a person-to-person basis (as in feudalism - the king is ""superior"" to peasants), or does it happen through objects (ie people are technical equal, but inequal in their relation to commodity ownership/exchange)?""**  As for contradiction, there are many he talks about.  An easy example is that capitalism creates a large working class, which then, Marx predicts, will act against the interests of capitalists by organizing unions and fighting for better wages (for example).  To spell it out crudely, its a contradiction because capitalism creates the thing which challenges it.  But capitalism does this itself too - the constant revolutionizing of means of production means capitalism creates the new industry which kills the old industry.  I hope these are useful, I used to get confused by ""contradiction"" myself, probably still get tripped up!  2. The contradictions don't necessarily give rise to new ""means of production"", but new ""social relations of production"".  For example, the Industrial Revolution is not a high-tech revolution, most historians (including non Marxists) would say.  The Industrial Revolution was important in how it organized labor, along with some clever engineering tricks (but nothing really that ""hi-tech"").  These changing social relations happen due to changes in social conditions, class struggle, etc.  Marx suggests, for example, that the privatization of public land lead to landless laborers that lead to the industrial revolution.  Recent scholarship has thrown this idea into doubt, at least before the 19th century.  But the idea is to look at social relations, class struggle, that kind of thing, as they evolve as a function of the social relations of production.  There is again, lots of subtlety and debate here.  Some Marxists might even disagree, but this is a fairly standard perspective.  &#x200B;  >I was told that later in his life Marx articulated beyond communism (as it was understood and implemented last century) as the direction history will go as the means of production evolves. However, this is not the Marx people know of today. The popular view is a dogmatic one and this muddied the water on Marxist and Marxian thinking.  Not really sure what you mean about ""beyond communism"", and myself am not much of a ""Marxologist"" (a person familiar with the intellectual development of Marx).  People view Marxism as dogmatic today, because Soviet propaganda and *ideology* was dogmatic.  And today, many people do *dogmatically* stick with all of his ideas.  I'm not saying defending his ideas is dogmatism, but from many people you get a feeling of Marx as a prophet, not Marx as an intellectual.  As British Marxist Historian EP Thompson said, ""Marx is on our side, we are not on Marx's side"".  &#x200B;  >Interestingly, you are probably familiar with Fukuyama whose essay ""The End of History"" caused quite a stir. He used it to state that democracy is essentially the end of history, as I imagine you already understood. Is there some credible consensus about the future of political and economic development given the inherent contradictions in our present model, or are we truly at the end of history?  Marxists would say Fukuyama is simply wrong - even non-deterministic Marxists argue that capitalism is unstable, and that its perpetuity is not guaranteed.  Although I think, after the crises financially and socially of the past 20 years, many non-Marxists would agree. Iirc, Fukuyama no longer believes history is ""over"".  **Edit:** I should add: Marxists would say what the USA is today is not truly a ""democracy"" (and likewise for most Western democracies).  For a very crude reasoning, consider this: most people\`s lives are determined not so much by national politics (ofc, it is important), but by their workplace.  Imagine if the company decided to close down where you work - your life would be screwed up, without you having a say!  That is, the workplace is an authoritarian, non-democratic place that immanently affects your life in dramatic ways.  This authoritarianism of the economy extends up to all levels of society, because they can pay for ads in campaigns, or bribes, etc.  There is unequal power in our society, greatly to the advantage of the capitalist class.  For Marxists, this means that we do not have ""democracy"" - ""power of the people"".  Instead, we have a system which periodically permits the contribution of the masses, but otherwise, the capitalist class is constantly directly influencing politics, in ways that the masses cannot (unless we protest or strike constantly).  This isn't to say America is evil or a total lie.  I like voting.  But is it a democracy?  Ehhh, more so than other places, but thats relatively speaking  &#x200B;  >Separately, I'm wondering if you could elaborate more on your thoughts of Plato. Given his massive influence on Christian thought, I'm wondering if you could contextualize where the world has accepted his thinking despite it being wrong. I realize I seem to think of Plato for his legacy and have not really scrutinized his philosophical thinking.  This is an entirely separate issue, but a brief response (I just wanted to use Plato as an extreme example of using his techniques of analysis, without necessarily believing his ideas, but giving them their due respect).  Plato is wrong, as expected - he wrote over 2000 years ago.  Its hardly a scandal (but most of his ideas aren't considered stupid, and many are still useful).  He wrote about most philosophical topics, and as philosophy as a field has evolved, people have inevitably found problems in his system (or else, what would philosophers do?).  To be clear, Plato was okay with being wrong - the dialogue ""Parmenides"" is a criticism of his own philosophy (but a criticism of the alternative).  Plato's ""mission"", at very least, was for people to be humble, not be so confident in their knowledge, and question it in a logical form - the Socratic dialogue.  He hated people using obscurantist writing to appear smart (ie sophistry), and wanted knowledge to be crystal clear to anyone willing to engage in conversation.  This is a question more for r/askphilosophy though!  Historically, Plato's influence in Christianity is more at the VERY beginning of the Church, and when his texts re-enter western Christendom after the mid 15th century.  Aristotle arguably plays a larger role in Christian theology (Thomas Aquinas was the big Aristotelian you may have heard about).  I\`d suggest r/askphilosphy or r/AcademicBible for more informed answers though.  Also: I wouldn\`t NOT read Capital, its just kind of big and dense.  Also, if you want a more accessible (albeit less thorough) pamphlet from Marx and Engels, ""[Wage Labour and Capital](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/wage-labour/index.htm)"" is often recommended.  &#x200B;  Most important, remember not to read this too much as dogmas.  Think of these as tools for analysis.  Marx was an intellectual, a scholar, willing to return to old ideas and change them if new evidence required it.  He was open to considering the role of climate, colonization, technology, all of this good stuff (tongue in cheek!).  Of course, the motor was always class struggle for Marx (think of how boring history would be if slaves, peasants and workers were, like Star Wars droids, entirely willing and happy subjects of their ruling class), but we don\`t need to dogmatically avoid other approaches to history and current events.  And Marxists may find nice insights in these other approaches!  Thanks for the gold!",Sugbaable,2022-12-08T18:30:08,2

"The labor theory of value is the idea that the value of a good or service is solely determined by the amount of labor that went into bringing it to the consumer. You add together the labor to harvest raw resources, process into a good, and transport it to the consumer. But since laborers get paid a fraction of that value per unit sold, that means that the value must be being stolen by the owners of the companies who don't contribute to the labor, but reap the majority of the profits.  The problem with this theory is that goods and services have a variable value depending on the buyer. Think of the concept of an auction in the context of the Labor Theory. If an identical good from the same production line sells for $20 in one lot and $50 in another, was the value of the labor used to make it different for each? Modern Marxists try to patch this problem by redefining value as being a more abstract concept that isn't necessarily tied to what is paid for the good or service. This doesn't really work compared to the modern theory.  The Marginal theory is that the value of the good or service is solely determined by what the consumer is willing to pay for it. This is an unknown value until the transaction with the consumer is made. The role of the capital owner is not ""stealing value from workers"", but taking on the risk of trying to sell something that consumers don't want to buy at a price the seller can afford to produce it at. This theory models what we observe much better than the Labor theory and other earlier models.",Volsunga,2022-12-05T10:46:02,8
"The basic principle of the Labor Theory of Value is that you can determine the correct value for any good/service by adding up the cost of all labor that went into producing it.  While both simple and intuitive, it has the significant drawback of also being wrong. In reality, there is no 'correct' value for a good/service beyond what the market dictates.  Since much of Marx's political ideology is based on the discrepancy between the 'correct' value and the price you're charged being evidence of exploitation by one social class over another, his entire political ideology falls apart once you recognize the flaws of the Labor Theory of Value.  That doesn't mean Marx doesn't contain a lot of jargon we still or useful notions - for example, he was a major proponent of using economics as a tool to examine broad historical forces - but his political/economic views are obsolete.

"Was Marx theories completely thought out at the time? Obviously not since economic theory was rudimentary at the time and Marx did not want to get rid of money.   The deal with money is that monopolies naturally accumulate vast wealth for the founders. AT&T had a monopoly on wire communication from the 1880s through the 1980s. Musk had a monopoly on electronic payments for almost a decade. Apple had a monopoly on smart phones until Google developed Android.   Marx was opposed to the accumulation of great wealth, but had no answer for what to do about monopolies except to ban them. We would not have the modern world we live in without monopolies.   It might be appropriate to update Marx theories to resolve the issue of how monopolies can coexist with socialism, otherwise the wealthy will kill it in the crib before it gets the opportunity to blossom.   I think the single best example is that free bachelors degree education starting with community college generates profit for the government in the form of tax revenue that exceeds the cost of the degree.   That is obviously socialism, however it would also be a profit-making venture because some colleges would be federally funded based on the return-on-investment for the degrees they offer.   The profit-making motive appeals to capitalists. We also know education reduces crime because Norway has been closing prisons since free college education was adopted, minimum wage was adjusted to permit living, and they stopped treating incarceration like human zoos instead of buying more police like we do in the US.   > [How Norway turns criminals into good neighbours](https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-48885846)  But monopolists want to starve the public and incarcerate economic refugees in order to accumulate wealth.

"> For example, I could make a lot more money by freelancing my labor, but working for a corporation significantly lowers my take-home pay.  Could you? Most of the time this is not the case.  The corporation does take part of the revenue from your work. But in most cases, the corporation's work is actually more valuable than theirs. The corporation connects you with customers and provides a variety of other support mechanisms that you'd otherwise need to pay for yourself.  Moreover, the corporation incurs virtually all of the *risk* - and risk costs money.  You might stop to ask yourself this: if being employed by a corporation is so exploitative, why do people do it?  When you look at people who primarily earn their income through freelancing, they're almost never doing it for the money. Indeed, they'll normally point out that they could make a lot more money if they 'turned corporate'. Instead, they're doing it for the freedom it affords.  Now, Marx didn't place any value at all on the institutional benefits, which makes his entire theory invalid for calculating value. But even if he did, the notion of 'just add up all the value' still doesn't work because no one knows how to do it. It is very literally the equivalent of a horse race gambling system that depends on already knowing which horse ran the race.  Essentially, the allure of Marxist economics is also the critical failure: confusing not knowing the value of what others produce with them producing no value.  Note: There are other flaws in Marx's approach - his failure to acknowledge the importance of time and risk, for example.",ViskerRatio,2022-12-05T11:57:47,0
"But you proposed that the 'point of LTV' was that 'if workers stop working there's zero way to produce value'. I guess my question is, if that's the point of LTV, wouldn't Marx have said that?  Or are you instead saying that Marx was wrong, and the truth is that LTV *should* be described this way?",yaya-pops,2022-12-05T15:55:31,1
The demonstrably false assumed linkage is that a person must be some combination of workaholic and/or unethical in order to become wealthy.  It’s not the case.  Certainly there are some rich people who have terrible work life balance.  Just as there are poor people that have terrible work life balance.  Proves nothing.    Also bound up in the false assumption is a complete blindness to the reality that people go through phases and stages of life.,Ok-Brilliant-1737,2022-12-05T17:35:40,-2
">Could you? Most of the time this is not the case.  Yes, but I would have to build skills I don't have or necessarily want to spend time on (networking, accounting, marketing, etc.). A corporate structure can slot you in like a cog in the machine. You can focus on a single skill rather than divide your attention.  That's great when you're just starting out.  Freelancing can bring greater rewards but requires you to take on greater risks and spread yourself too thinly.  >But in most cases, the corporation's work is actually more valuable than theirs.  I assure you that's not the case.  >Moreover, the corporation incurs virtually all of the *risk* - and risk costs money.  Depends how you define risk. A capital owner is only risking their capital. Maybe you can measure that in the billions of USD. But a worker risks their time, lives, and bodies. I can't take on a risk if failure means I have to starve. I'm not sure that's measurable in a dollar amount.  A labor-centered framework would look at a person's 20-year career at McDonalds as far more risky than a billionaire dumping funds into a risky tech startup. The billionaire can shrug at failure, whereas an exploited laborer's failures are devasting to that person's life.  >But even if he did, the notion of 'just add up all the value' still doesn't work because no one knows how to do it. It is very literally the equivalent of a horse race gambling system that depends on already knowing which horse ran the race.  It's more aspirational than computational, no? The Marxist framework would be more interested in asking *how* the horse gambling system is constructed, who benefits from wins and losses, how bookies calculate odds, and so forth. It would not be interested in designing a strategy for maximizing your potential winnings in such a system. I would think the Marxist is more interested in saying, ""The house always wins, and here's why"" rather than hyper-focusing on the protein-to-carb ratio in the diet of the winning horses and designing a betting strategy around that.  In other words, my limited understanding of Marxism is that it's best understood as a lens to critique capitalism rather than a wholly freestanding institution of its own.",veggiesama,2022-12-05T12:38:26,2
"I think you wrote MTV when you meant LTV, but I hear what you're saying.  \>  I guess my question is, if that's the point of MTV, wouldn't Marx have said that?Marx did say that. That's basically the thesis statement of socialism - workers have all the power so long as we work together.  I'm trying to say that, in my opinion, Marx was wrong in attempting to \*mathematically prove\* that labor is the origin of value. For one, it's glaringly obvious, and for two, its needlessly complicated to do so and couples the argument to economic assertions that can be debated instead of engaging with the simple, powerful message of ""wow, things sure would be better if the folks doing the work were in charge instead of a bunch of rich old dudes who are insulated from the consequences of war and scarcity"".  Or perhaps more simply, ""Power should be elected, and since wealth is power, that should be elected too.""  So why did Marx make the mistake of trying to prove that? Well, like with all philosophers, you have to take their shtick in its historical context. Marx and his contemporaries were \*absolutely certain\* that recent historical events like the Paris Commune were signaling that a revolution was imminent in the imperial core (basically, Germany). There was a lot of energy spent at the time trying to prove that this revolution \*was\* actually imminent to try and to gain credibility for their cause.  Proving stuff was was still very new and very sexy at the time; the scientific method was still pretty new by our standards. For example, Darwin was just getting published and only later a huge chunk of Darwin's work would be disproven (gemmules and pangenesis). But, we hold on to what Darwin got right (speciation). IMO, LTV is an outgrowth of the, let's say, feverishness to try and prove stuff at the time.  What LTV gets right is that it demonstrates how value originates in labor, but it has its own ""pangenesis"" and ""gemmules"" that we now know enough to discard. And that's important! We need to discard what doesn't work and keep what does. Marx was clearly wrong about the revolution: A socialist revolution in Germany was not inevitable, they had a fascist coup instead.  But, he was clearly right about a lot of other stuff as well.",9d47cf1f,2022-12-05T16:37:45,3
