Wasn’t this Eric Adam’s get out of jail free card?,Fit-Significance-436,2025-05-03T09:30:38,34

"Fuck the NYPD, well the police in general. They lied on an affadavit that led to Eric Garner's murder, made t-shirts mocking his last words, and the officers involved were granted immunity for admitting they lied.  An NYPD cruiser runs over a little girl from an undocumented family and kills her, and were threatening her family to drop the legal case against them. They're incompetent, racist, and evil, even giving ""get out of a ticket free"" cards to their friends and family.   Fuck the police, they are a true source of waste, fraud, and abuse between stealing overtime, sleeping in their cruisers, killing with impunity, testilying, and sitting on their hands during mass shootings. Fuck them and fuck everyone with a Back the Blue sticker on their car.",papibigdaddy,2025-05-03T16:43:11,12

So freedom of speech was always just for whites huh?  Shit like this is why adult kids avoid family in rural America,imperialTiefling,2025-05-03T09:29:07,55

You’re not a good person.,GL2U22,2025-05-03T15:08:14,3
Because fuck freedom of speech. It's not like its one of our founding principals or something. It's ok to discard it for the bread and circuses they promised you to distract you from how much worse your life is getting.,Every-Ad3280,2025-05-03T13:43:45,3

Advocating harm against the US or an ally isn't exactly protected speech.  She was here on a B-2 tourist visa.  Probably not a good idea to participate in protests.,box-cable,2025-05-03T09:45:45,-49
"Idk man. If you’re in this country and supporting terrorism then your visa should be checked. Sharing the data among agencies seems normal tbh. If you step back from your opinions on Israel and look at the basics, then it makes sense. Imagine this in the months and years after 9/11",Surround8600,2025-05-03T13:08:09,-19
Read the article again. The charge was dismissed.,cubert73,2025-05-03T11:14:21,17
>Advocating harm against the US or an ally isn't exactly protected speech.  >She was here on a B-2 tourist visa. Probably not a good idea to participate in protests.  Do you or the Trump administration have proof that she advocated for harm against the U.S or an ally?  No.  Free Speech does not just apply to persons that right-wing extremists like Trump and MAGA prefer.,ResidentKelpien,2025-05-03T10:25:46,47
"Define “harm against the us” and “ally”  Don’t like the iraq war? “Harm against the us”  Don’t like the vietnam war? “Harm against the us”  Don’t like Egypt’s dictatorahip? “Harms against an us ally”  Don’t like Saudi Arabia? “Harms against an us ally”  I swear, being pro Israel degrade people’s faculty as much as lead in water",Automatic-Wonder-299,2025-05-03T10:19:58,39
"The courts found that she did nothing wrong and dismissed the charges.  Meanwhile, you are still here trying to argue in favor of violating the courts, the rule of law, and the bill of rights to persecute someone who has already been cleared of any wrongdoing.",HerbaciousTea,2025-05-03T13:36:42,14
Maybe you need to take a step back from your opinions on Isreal if they're leading you down this path.,afishinthewell,2025-05-03T14:45:56,10

Yeah it’s a gray area. This isn’t an actual citizen and they lied on their application. Also they’re terrorizing kids and campuses. I see both sides but no.,Surround8600,2025-05-03T16:51:49,-7
