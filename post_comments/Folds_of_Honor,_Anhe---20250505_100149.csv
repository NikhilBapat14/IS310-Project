"Maybe you guys can give me some input on this. When a company does what they did and we all stop giving them our business, that punishment is effective, and as this shows, convinces them to change course.   Should we start rewarding them for fixing their mistake, or should we boycott them until the day we die because they should’ve known better in the first place and they need to have their profits suffer for 50 years so that no company ever even considers making a mistake like that ever again?  I lean toward the second option but if someone has a good argument for giving them my business again, I’d really like to hear it.",komatsu-D355a,2025-05-08T04:29:47,1

"To be totally honest, I haven't bought or had a drink of Budweiser for 40 years. I went right to Michelobe when I started drinking then switched to Sam Adams in the 90's. Tried a bud around 2000 and it tasted like water to me.  Now I just don't feel like drinking alcohol except my Asti on New Years.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-05T12:59:31,3
