Trying to keep Biden's name in the discourse for when Trump fully crashes the economy and needs someone to blame,ScubaSteveEL,2025-04-24T21:07:51,532

"Well duh, Trump was handed a thriving and growing economy due to Biden's pragmatic and steady economic policies that righted the ship after Trump's mishandling of the pandemic.  US saw greater increase to inflation caused by Trump during and coming out of the pandemic than most other 1st world countries (not to mention  a million+ needless deaths than we would have had had Trump followed Obama's pandemic playbook), and following the 2022 peak Biden's sensible economic policies reversed course and lead to a faster decrease in inflation and increase in economic growth and stability than other countries.   Then immediately upon Trump taking office again he undid all the good that was done and then some (well that's an understatement) and sunk us into a major recession, tanked international relations and trade, and made himself the most hated person in the entire world, not for being ""strong"" or a ""stable genius"" but for being so goddamn stupid he'll go down in history as the dumbest world leader to ever live.  So of course Biden is constantly on his mind. Biden wasn't perfect, but Trump is an utter failure of a leader and human being in comparison to...well, everyone.",IsThatHearsay,2025-04-24T21:16:30,243

"Oh believe me, I know it.   I come from a historically conservative, white, top <1% upper-class wealthy trust fund family who has voted Republican for decades. We were quintessentially the conservative ""ideal"", and admittedly blissfully unaware ourselves of our privileges. Until empirical data. Until Trump. Until the rise of MAGA.  My whole family and most of our similarly situated peers (*finally*) left the GOP with the rise of Trump, largely because of us younger generations.   (*To preface, I'm a tax and economic policy Attorney btw, so I know what the fuck I'm talking about here, if that helps. Not that you need to be one to see the damage the GOP has continually caused for generations*).   I'm a stickler for data. And it's clear to see that despite their loud assertions otherwise, despite the false narratives spewed by FoxNews, the Republican party has not held a sensible beneficial long-term economic policy since before Reagan. ""Trickle-down"" economics was a scam, their own creators had admitted to it in private recordings. Short-term market manipulations and tax cuts did nothing but yield temporary Market boosts (not boosts to the Economy as a whole, which most Republicans can't seem to differentiate), and repeated long-term damage to not only the economy but also the GOPs precious stock market than if we had relied consistently on steady and pragmatic gradual growth under Democratic leadership.   Modern Republicans love to call Democrats ""snowflakes"" for fighting for human rights, when the GOP policy framework has been to cause nothing but upheaval and non-stop hate-fuel emotion-driven drama for decades now with no actual policy direction or long-term benefits to anyone but corporations and a fraction of the 1%, or to simply ""hurt the Left."" They fear for what they do not understand, and are so fragile and shallow-minded that they cannot see the bigger picture of any issue (even when it detrimentally impacts themselves). Snowflakes. There's a reason the past three Democratic presidents passed Economic Recovery/Relief packages pretty much immediately upon each entering office to restabilize the country and correct the damage the GOP caused.  And that doesn't even begin to tackle the social societal damages, damages to human rights, damages and constant hate toward minorities and the LGBTQ+ community, damages to international relations, the various wars, and the degradation of our country's infrastructure, education, healthcare, necessary social welfare programs, and much much more.   Outside of Trump's grifting ilk, not a single American benefits under ***any*** of his current policies, not even us in the 1%, all of which he campaigned heavily on and were published in their literal Project 2025 book everyone was free to read (so not a single person has any excuse to claim ignorance). Goldman Sachs and countless other financial advisors and institutions said this specifically in the months leading up to the election. And not a single Executive Order or action he's done in the first 100 days have been a surprise, other than the speed at which it's happening (thanks to no one standing up to him).   But it just shows how dumb your average MAGAt (and every person over at the / conserv... [*sub which auto-mod won't let me post*]) truly is when even most of the historically ""ideal"" Republicans turned on Trump. Hell, exit polls showed if only those with college degrees or better voted this election, Kamala would have won almost every single state.  Meaning the GOP base is left largely as the bigoted, racist, most uneducated voters who have caused this mess. Every single person who voted Trump is part of that lot, whether they like it or not, and literally 100% of Trump's policies will ultimately hurt them.  Not a single one will benefit them in the short or long term. And ignorance is no excuse. Even the Neo-Nazi hicks who voted purely on ""immigration"" (read: racism) failed to understand how $90 Billion dollars annually are taken in via taxes by illegal immigrants, who don't profit off our social programs from paying in those taxes. Immigrants are largely the lifeblood of our economy.    Even before the election it was published that Trump's deportation plan expected to reduce US GDP by 4-7% *minimum*, just that stance alone, not even taking into account the tariffs, which were predicted to raise everyday goods by 40-60% in the short-term and at a cautious estimate (with few believing Trump would enact them to this idiotically severe of a degree), with lasting damages for potential decades in international trade relations. Hell 40 out of 44 (91%) of Trump's first term hand-picked cabinet members even advised against voting for Trump. Yet you know who didn't listen to all this? You know who idiotically thought they knew better than all the analysts? ""C*nservatives"". MAGAts.  And don't even get me started on the rest of Project 2025 and the christo-facist ideals the modern Heritage Foundation wishes to implement that is akin to a mentally impaired but somehow more fascist and Alt-right religious ethnostate than 1930s Nazi Germany, without any of the means of production or economic growth to even support it.  It's just baffling how unbelievably stupid conservative MAGAts are who still worship Trump.   /rant. Well that was fun. Sadly rants while slightly inebriated late-night can't fix the stupidity inherent in a large portion of our population. But it can at least try to spread the truth and logic.  *Edit*: Some words.

"Your second paragraph is the part that kills me about people. How difficult is it to understand that it's harder to build/repair than it is to destroy?  I'm not a historian, but I did a little browsing on FDR and what I learned was that he had supermajorities in both chambers of Congress for a good chunk of his time in office. That's what we need if the goal is significant progress.  I don't know if we'll have the opportunity, considering what the GOP has planned regarding elections. But, if we can boot the GOP from majorities in Congress, get back the presidency in '28, and keep them away for 10+ years, then we might have a chance. That's a tall order, I get that. That's what we've got, though.  We can squabble about the Democrats and their shortcomings all day long for the rest of the year. But, given where we find ourselves, the best bet is to give the Democrats full control and then start booting the dinosaurs like Pelosi out to make way for fresh faces.  The GOP isn't the only bad actor in all of this. The wealthy have their claws in both parties. It needs to be a calculated strategy. As I said earlier, I'm not a historian.

"Look at his posture. Even when sitting, he has that distinctive dementia lean. He’s disheveled, incoherent, paranoid, and repetitive. He’s the equivalent of a magic eight ball of responses without any substance. Even his makeup application screams dementia. IMO.   I love watching the progression of the disease for him because it’s subtle and not-so subtle all at the same time. I’m baffled that more people aren’t speaking to his obvious cognitive decline every day. If we pulled text from his recent speeches and rants, software could easily quantify his dwindling vocabulary over the past 10 years. Shorter sentences. Fewer syllables. Lots of ambiguous pronouns. Off topic AF.   I look forward to the day when the people in his inner circle are more transparent about Trump’s current day-to-day life. Someone is dressing him. Someone is propping him up every hour of the day like Weekend at Bernie’s. He’s sundowning on social media. He’s impulsive, easy to manipulate, and beyond tired pretending to work five-hour days.",chubbierunner,2025-04-25T08:48:47,8
