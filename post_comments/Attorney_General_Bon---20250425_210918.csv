"This ignores the fact that the REASON these protections exist is that the journalists are not required to reveal their sources (1st amendment protection). So it was wasting a lot of people’s time trying to get journalists to talk. Here we go again. As painful as this will be, I hope journalists can stay strong.",Austin_Peep_9396,2025-04-25T21:12:19,72

How is her ass not locked up already for being in contempt of the Supreme Court? How is she rescinding anything when she should be behind bars?  Also take your cross necklace off - if god is real you’re the kind of person he made hell for.,no_kids-and-3_money,2025-04-25T21:27:36,16
"Of course she does.  The libertarian constitutional types seem to be asleep while the first, second, fourth amendment get flouted.",Historical_Bend_2629,2025-04-25T21:14:32,17
"Can you take the kid gloves off now guys? I see headlines every day that are far too sanguine for what's happening right now. Stop dancing around what's happening and state it for what it is.   It's not deportation without process, It's rendition.   It's not launching a cryptocurrency, it's money laundering and a bribery vehicle.   It's not ""a strong stance on negotiations between Ukraine and Russia"", it's aiding an enemy of the United States against an ally.   Stop giving Trump the benefit of the doubt. He's lost the right to not have malfeasance assumed around his actions and orders. If they look illegal and sketchy, say it straight. Call it out.",BLU3SKU1L,2025-04-25T22:47:48,12

"Freedom of the press is gone and has been from the moment Trump sued news outlets and they settled out of court, this is just the next step to bury freedom of the press. The only new you will soon hear is what the mango messiah preaches. Freedom of speech and rights, freedoms liberties are being lowered into the grave. News networks are white washing trumps actions and making excuses because they fear his actions or are blatantly complicit",CAM6913,2025-04-26T09:32:58,1
Just a note that sources of illegally disseminated (classified) information are not legally protected and journalists can and have been held in criminal contempt for trying to withhold them.,Son_of_York,2025-04-25T21:31:12,-35
"They won't take the kiddie gloves off until We the People stop quoting them.  I want to stop seeing ""Constitutional Crisis"" and instead see something like: ""He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.""   Maybe even something like: ""He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.""  Shit, we could throw in: ""He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.""  I kinda like: ""For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world""  Here's a classic: ""For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences""  Remember that time Trump claimed Birthright Citizenship isn't a thing, before he acted on it with all those children: ""He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.""  Not quite the full quote: ""He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us""",BananasAndAHammer,2025-04-26T07:12:37,2
The person leaking the information broke the law. The journalist reporting it is not (nor does the journalist have any responsibility to participate in the prosecution of the leaker). This is well established.,Austin_Peep_9396,2025-04-25T22:25:11,36
