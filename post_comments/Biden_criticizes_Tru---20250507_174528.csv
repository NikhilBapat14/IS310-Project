Just like Walter appeases Jeff Dunham.,Caraes_Naur,2025-05-07T18:43:32,1
I wonder if applying reverse psychology and praising Trump’s handling of Putin might be the right thing to do.,lefty7111,2025-05-07T19:07:39,1
"I dont care what he says about anyone at this point. Old man you had your time, screwed the near future for us, and now please for the love of our nation go the F away. Take all the other nursing home refugees from congress with you and go see the creature together. We cant fix things with you folks in the way.",ceiffhikare,2025-05-08T07:27:03,1
Just like how Biden tried to appease Putin by slowly trickling in support for Ukraine and blocking them from using their weapons fully out of fear of provoking Russia?  Yeah fuck off senile Joe.,SpectreFire,2025-05-07T18:06:30,-1
"Holy shit, that dude is still alive?  Maybe everyone would give a shit what he has to say if he hadn’t run for reelection like he promised not to and sentence to this living hell under Trump.",Indy_IT_Guy,2025-05-07T19:13:43,1
"As per usual, Biden, much like Hillary, is right.  Of course that won't stop the usual crowd of insufferable, insignificant limpdicks from chiming in with their tired material.",borfmantality,2025-05-07T20:35:34,0
Fuck Biden. He is the sole reason the criminal bigot dictator got re-elected. Go away and never speak again.,Ourmomentourtime,2025-05-07T22:24:05,-1
Agreed !,ComplexWrangler1346,2025-05-07T17:49:25,1
"But when Biden enabled trump by refusing to hold him accountable for the coup attempt, it's pretty shitty for Biden to open his mouth at all. He might as well look in the mirror when criticizing trump since he's to blame for trump being in the whitehouse instead of a prison cell. So he can fuck off. ",Bakedads,2025-05-07T18:19:58,-2
Don’t worry his legacy is giving too much aid to adding Palestinian children’s skulls to his neckless.  Tit for tat,RelevantNothing2692,2025-05-07T19:53:37,1
That’s not the way the government and judicial system works. That’s the way trump wants it to work.,pmmeyoursmalltits0,2025-05-07T18:22:54,2
"Hey, I liked him, however bad his campaign was. Poor bastard is going to be targeted for this, though.",Huckleberry-V,2025-05-07T21:18:20,0
