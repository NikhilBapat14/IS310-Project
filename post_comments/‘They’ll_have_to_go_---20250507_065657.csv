Pretty sure they don't want to stay anyways much less come.¬† Based on the downward trajectory of travelers coming to America what would ever make them believe people would want to?¬†¬†,arilupe,2025-05-07T06:59:50,24

"LMAO, people spend tens of thousands of dollars to travel to and attend the World Cup.  They are already doing fine, they don't want to stay here, much less come here, especially if their team has games in Canada or Mexico.",BluWake,2025-05-07T07:30:58,7

">However, numerous quips were made about the potential of visitors overstaying their welcome ‚Äì notable given the administration‚Äôs recent crackdown on immigrants and green card holders, which has included unlawfully deporting some to a megaprison in El Salvador.  >‚ÄúWe want them to come, we want them to celebrate, we want them to watch the game,‚Äù said vice-president JD Vance. ‚ÄúBut when the time is up, they‚Äôll have to go home. Otherwise they‚Äôll have to talk to Secretary Noem.‚Äù  >The World Cup could also present problems for fans looking to move around within host cities, as most within the United States lack well-developed public transportation options. Transportation secretary Sean Duffy said that most inter-city transportation issues would be solved with buses, and that no long-lasting transit projects would remain as a result of hosting the tournament.  >‚ÄúThis is a short-term push of people coming in to see soccer matches, and then they‚Äôll go home,‚Äù said Duffy, who encouraged visitors to use the World Cup as an opportunity to take a road trip around the US. ‚ÄúBut don‚Äôt overstay your visa,‚Äù he said.  Oh such jokers these guys haha.  I sad it before, this WC has the potential to be a major shitshow, and since FIFA is a corrupt piece of corporate shit I am looking forward to it.",Eat_the_Rich1789,2025-05-07T06:59:09,6

"I have serious doubts about how many people will risk trying to go in the first place. My friend and I both go to tournaments when we qualify (which tbf isn‚Äôt often ü§£) but we‚Äôve already agreed that we aren‚Äôt going to the USA if we make it, though we‚Äôll go if we are based in Canada and Mexico.

"Pretty sure I would be selling my tickets or just counting them as a loss instead of coming to the U.S. to deal with this b.s.   If attendance is actually high, I‚Äôll eat my shirt.   Our tourism is already tanking due to this Republican regime‚Äôs policies. I doubt anyone with actual brains is going to risk coming to the U.S. where they can be rounded up, forcefully shaven, then shoved onto a plane that will take them to a foreign prison whom the U.S. will pay to hold them until death. All without a chance to prove you are here legally. Not that it matters much. As has been shown, even those here legally are being sent to die in prison. POC will not be treated fairly by this regime, no matter how much they want your tourist money.",Used-Yogurtcloset757,2025-05-07T08:40:09,2

This idea they have that America is a desirable place to live for rich people (the only ones who can travel across the world for a sporting event) who can‚Äôt come here normally is insane.

"While flying into US once I had to transfer flights in Detroit, and this was a bit after they went bankrupt, and that was one and only time I was pulled out of a line in an airport for more checks, they called my company that paid for my flight to check if it was legit.
