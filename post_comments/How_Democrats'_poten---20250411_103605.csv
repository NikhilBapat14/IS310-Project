"I think Newsom used to stand a shot, but his capitulation to right wingers on his podcast and his RTO policy has soured too many people on him",Ok-Assistant-8876,2025-04-11T11:47:52,31
"If you put JB Prtizker's charisma and personality, in Gavin Newsoms traditional good looks, with Gretchen Whitmer's Midwest non coastal elite charm you would have a perfect candidate.",Shadow_Strike99,2025-04-11T10:51:37,20
" Newsom would be fine, but this country is never going to elect a California democrat. We need to get over that quick. I think Pritzker is it",icedcoffeeheadass,2025-04-11T12:23:22,11
"I think Newsom, Pritzker, and Whitmer are all pretty good candidates.  That being said, I am very disappointed about Whitmer‚Äôs stance on tariffs; all tariffs - even targeted tariffs - are bad. Calling them ‚Äútargeted tariffs‚Äù is just putting lipstick on a pig. That being said, I don‚Äôt think she should be criticized for doing what she had to do to save the Great Lakes ecosystem; Trump is, unfortunately, the President and she had to suck up to him to prevent invasive carp from irreparably damaging the Great Lakes ecosystem. Trump knew that and tried to use the situation to torpedo her.  As for Newsom, I like that he is so anti-tariff, that he has basically become a YIMBY, and that he is not bowing down to Trump. I worry that his association with big, blue California may hurt his chances nationally, however.  Pritzker could be a formidable candidate on the national stage. He has already come out against Trump, guns-blazing. I am waiting to hear what he has to say about tariffs, because so far he has only condemned Trump‚Äôs tariffs as a ‚Äútax on working families.‚Äù However, being from the midwest I worry he may come out in support of targeted tariffs. (Given the Midwest‚Äôs industrial past, they are unfortunately more likely to erroneously support protectionist policies).",iusedtobekewl,2025-04-11T11:07:48,5
"I'll be interested to see/hear the arguments for why Cory Booker shouldn't be the Democratic presidential nominee , as they roll out. Especially to see if the American public, and media driving the narrative, will have learned to focus on what's important and meaningful, yet.",Level_Chemistry8660,2025-04-11T16:09:43,2
I'm still going with Andy Beshear,FickleSystem,2025-04-11T19:02:03,2
"I don‚Äôt think Newsom has a chance given he is too tied to CA and their struggles the last few years, no one wants that on a national level. I think Beshear is really strong",Kind-City-2173,2025-04-11T11:41:18,2
"Pritzker is my favorite right now.  Two weeks into DJT new term, here‚Äôs Gov. Pritzker.  https://youtu.be/_nJ0Ub9SVXQ?si=q7opPYCFHAjK5gUI",ladymorgahnna,2025-04-12T02:18:25,1
"Well, if you listen to his podcast than you would understand his reasons for having those three guests in particular on his show, and that he is not, capitulating to the right (who wouldn't listen to his podcast, anyways).   As for the RTO policy, this isn't a hill to die on. But, since you brought it up -- it applies to State workers only, and the requirement is 4, not 5 days back in office.  Those who live 50 miles or greater, have a disability, or are in roles that benefit from WFH are exempt.  The entire work-life balance thing is rather a new concept.    For the record, I personally don't care.  As long as the work gets done it shouldn't matter how long it takes or where tasks are being completed.  I am just saying that if Covid never happened we likely wouldn't even be mentioning it.",crucial_geek,2025-04-11T12:54:11,6

"I remember when he was in the primary, I don't know he just didn't seem to have ""it"" , almost like Harris back then, nothing wrong, but also kind of boring, he is a very good politician, but I wonder if he just a much better senate leader than president material, but I would definitely put him ahead of another harris run or Newsome.",NeatlyCritical,2025-04-11T17:47:28,3
"Unfortunately, his not being married is a problem. Even Buttepiege has a better shot simply because he is a married man, even if he is married to another man.",Rosebunse,2025-04-11T16:33:22,2
"I watched the podcasts. Newsom barely pushed back on these fascist maniacs and basically helped to normalize their insanity. He did himself no favors with this pivot, and it‚Äôs backfiring on him; he looks disingenuous. The RTO is a Musk/Trump/GOP agenda and hurts workers. It shows a shift to the right in his thinking and is an unpopular move. I don‚Äôt see him getting the nomination at this point",Ok-Assistant-8876,2025-04-11T13:03:44,18
"Let‚Äôs just hope Ossoff flattens his challenger in 2026. If he does, he could be our golden ticket.",iusedtobekewl,2025-04-11T13:15:58,2
"If Ossoff wins re-election, he'll immediately rocket up the list of contenders. The only reason he isn't there already, is because Kemp is still projected to win",RVarki,2025-04-12T03:50:15,1
"It's sad that superficial things plays such a big factor in politics all across the world, but they objectively do matter for people. A big reason why someone like Bill Clinton was so popular was because he was charming, smooth and handsome. Him going on the Arsenio Hall show and playing the sax üé∑ with sunglasses made him the coolest white guy to ever live in people's minds.  Or how Obama being very handsome and traditionally masculine helped him get out disinfranchised voters, just on that alone.",Shadow_Strike99,2025-04-11T10:57:00,8
"Nope.  It can.  Obama ran an election on hope and change, but even in 2007 libs, Dems, and Progressives (because they are not always one and the same) expressed doubt that a black man could win a national election because of racism, which was a heckofalot more prominent in 2007 than it is today (just like LGB acceptance was less and even Dems were still debating if same-sex marriage is okay or not.  TQ+ was practically non-existent by today's standards.  And so on).  The day after he won, people online began taking bets on how long it would be until he was assassinated. No joke.  Then he won a second term.  Saying that a woman, or a guy dude, cannot win the election is false.  I get it though, the fear of losing is strong, and as such, Dems should run someone that they know can win.  Here is the thing--we don't know who that person will look like in 3 1/2 years from now and this narrative of a 'woman' or 'gay dude' cannot win is kinda flowing into the standard Conservative talking point of both groups being a lesser.",crucial_geek,2025-04-11T12:41:11,3
"It does make sense she supports them, it‚Äôs just bad policy though.  The problem is that tariffs sound real good and patriotic, but end up weakening domestic industries by subsidizing inefficient management, stifling the exchange of innovative ideas, and the reluctance to adopt new technologies. Domestic industries end up only being competitive because of the tariffs, all the while foreign industries kept innovating to be competitive in spite of the tariffs. They really do create a big mess and an awkward situation when our industries fall behind and we can‚Äôt remove the tariffs without tanking them.  The benefits of free trade are very true, it‚Äôs just a shame that it‚Äôs hard to paint with a patriotic brush; you have to explain why tariffs (even targeted tariffs) are bad, *and* you have explain why free trade is good. It‚Äôs a situation where the truth has to be demonstrated which is frustrating.",iusedtobekewl,2025-04-11T13:10:27,3
"In his episodes with Walz and Klein he opened up a little about why he had them on, and then with the last episode he went a little further with why he did it.   I do agree that he lost an opportunity to push back during those first three episodes, but that is beside the point and it is only backfiring with the far-left.   RTO is complicated at the Government level.  I know in DC for a few years many Federal buildings were mostly empty and Muriel Bowser complained about local businesses suffering because of a lack of people being around to support local businesses.  It is a change for everyone.    Also when dealing with the Government employees, everything they work on is considered private until it is released to the public, so there is a security risk, and, it was Congressional Republicans who began to push for RTO at the Fed level like two years ago, not Trump or Musk.   But this is only for Government employees.",crucial_geek,2025-04-11T13:25:02,3
