"This is utter bullshit. I just read the affidavit. She let him out through a side hallway in her own courtroom and the person they were there for used an inconveniently far away elevator bank to exit the building. Nothing about this is even remotely criminal in nature. She didn’t misdirect agents, she didn’t lie to them, they were angry that she didn’t just hand over someone on a non-judicial warrant. These fucking racist ICE agents believe their signed directives from even more racist superiors supersedes a judicial warrant signed by a judge - it doesn’t and they’re mad about it. It’s their only mechanism to be able to arrest, detain, and deport people they hate without due process of the courts.",sagan4dawin,2025-04-25T11:59:32,22
Now they come for the judges. Clarence Thomas has to be careful. He’s not a member of the Elite Club. In fact Kash Patel isn’t a member either. Makes you go hmmm,Stormy31568,2025-04-25T11:57:01,11
"Judge Hannah Dugan has been released. This is obviously political grandstanding.  ""Dugan was taken into custody by the FBI on Friday morning on the courthouse grounds, according to U.S. Marshals Service spokesperson Brady McCarron. She appeared briefly in federal court in Milwaukee later Friday before being released from custody. Her next court appearance is May 15.  The affidavit suggests that Dugan was alerted to the presence of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in the courthouse by her clerk, who was informed by an attorney that they appeared to be in the hallway.  The affidavit describes Dugan as “visibly angry” over the arrival of immigration agents in the courthouse and says that she pronounced the situation “absurd” before leaving the bench and retreating to her chambers. It says she and another judge later approached members of the arrest team inside the courthouse, displaying what witnesses described as a “confrontational, angry demeanor.”  She asked one of the officers if they had a judicial warrant and was told that the warrant was instead administrative. After a back-and-forth over the warrant, the affidavit says, she demanded that the arrest team speak with the chief judge and led them away from the courtroom.""  https://apnews.com/article/immigration-judge-arrested-7997186bbca5730e70a25f2347e631f6",TheRealBlueJade,2025-04-25T13:52:18,10

"? The specifics are in the article. Finish reading it.  >According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, ICE agents came to the courthouse with an arrest warrant that day, presented an arrest warrant, and were sent to the hallway outside Dugan's courtroom.  >According to the outlet, the judge said in an email that a warrant was not presented. She then allegedly directed the defendant and his attorney to a side door that led to a private hallway and into the public area on the same floor.  What's fishy, though, is Patel apparently deleted that tweet you just quoted (i don't have X and also refuse to go on it)  Edit: Update: she's now been actually charged.  https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/breaking/2025/04/25/milwaukee-county-judge-hannah-dugan-arrested-by-feds-at-courthouse/83270885007/  And here's an article debating legality.

"Maybe, but at the end of the day the law doesn't decide what's legal, the jury does. Something could be 100% illegal but if the jury decides it's legal then it is, and if the jury DOES find that it was legal, it establishes a precedent Trump may not want to have established.   Likely this is just a scare tactic. I'd be surprised if they risk bringing this in front of a jury.",imnota4,2025-04-25T15:51:32,5

"As expected... the point of my comment was to let people know she was not in jail as the right and people looking for attention wanted people to believe.  The selishishness and one upmanship need to stop. It is what got us into this mess in the first place and keeps us here. The second things turn in our favor, people start popping up to twist the narrative to get attention and karma.   There are days I just want to leave people to their own devices.(btw, it's not a good thing, but of course its meaning was been rewritten by people who think they are superior to others.)  I don't want attention. I want to live my life alone and in peace, but too many people are messing everything up for everyone for me to do that in good conscious. I, like so many others, are fighting to save the world while others are hurting it....Each one hurting the world is being driven by their own selfishness and greed... as well as immaturity and short-sightedness.
