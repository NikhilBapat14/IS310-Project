"The Fench Socialist Party is dead, but the french left is not. Jean-Luc Melanchon and his party La France Insoumise have effectively built a hard-left coalition that has been electorally successful. Melanchon got 20% of the vote in the last presidential election and 69 seats in the National Assembly. The French Communist Party hasn't gotten numbers close to that since the 70s.   The French Green Party didn't do so well in the last presidential election, but they did come in third in the last European Parliament elections",loselyconscious,2022-08-12T22:14:56,3
