"However, while Beijing appears to be open to negotiations, the Chinese Commerce Ministry warned that it would not be forced into making a bad deal. According to the Reuters translation, the ministry said that ""attempting to use talks as a pretext to engage in coercion and extortion would not work.""  Not a good sign China, ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³, CCP is arrogant and dangerous, Trump will not be fooled either. Suffer China, Communism doesnâ€™t work.  China thinks a bad deal is when China has to be fair. A good deal to China is when America gets ripped off, that is a good deal to China ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³, but it ainâ€™t happening! Try again China!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-05-02T10:02:40,16
