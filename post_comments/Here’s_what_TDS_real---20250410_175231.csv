"Like most things in Trump world, TDS is another form of projection.  Trump supporters are certainly deranged in their support of a narcissistic demagogue, and instead of accepting that, they claim others who point out his innumerable faults somehow are deranged for trying to steer the country away from his lunacy.",Rfalcon13,2025-04-10T19:36:48,7

"My own personal experience with this (relatives) is that MAGA has become part of their identity. This shit has been going on for a decade now, which means it's **really taken root**.   So asking these kinds of people to recognize his mistakes, crimes, idiocy, etc requires them to also chip away part of themselves. Well... that's really hard to do. So it's better to double down in denial, repeat mental gymnastics.  This is how cults work.",Larrea_tridentata,2025-04-10T23:37:58,4

Lol yes it always felt like an insane projection. And any Trump supporter accuses someone who dislikes Trump of having TDS needs professional help to see that theyre the ones with TDS.,encinitas2252,2025-04-10T20:15:18,3
