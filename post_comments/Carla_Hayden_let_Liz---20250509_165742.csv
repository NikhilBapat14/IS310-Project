My favorite thing about the whole lizzo flute controversy was how everyone who was upset didn't even know the flute existed until after it happened and got all mad because they were told to be mad.,The_Navy_Sox,2025-05-09T17:12:22,38
"I vaguely remember this but reflecting on it now I really appreciate what Carla Hayden and Library of Congress did in letting a Black, Grammy winning, classically trained flutist play an instrument made for a slave-owning President. It was subversive, symbolic, and empowering… everything this administration hates/is trying to destroy.",Old_Specific7310,2025-05-09T17:49:56,29

"I think more than anything when this administration does things like this, it’s a sign of all the tiny handed men being petty because, tiny hands.   There is no other explanation than fear that someone is **more** than themselves in anyway.",zaskar,2025-05-09T17:10:12,2

Is he that petty & catty? Uh huh!,jl56649,2025-05-09T17:48:58,1
No. What a stupid title. He can't remember that far back.,Plane_Highlight_8671,2025-05-10T06:42:36,1
"The *sole* value of conservatism is respect for and obedience to \[one's perception of\] traditionally established hierarchy, and hierarchy dictates that those on top (in-groups) are rightfully idolized and receive privileges, credibility, and resources, while those on the bottom (out-groups) are demonized/dehumanized and bound by restrictions, scrutiny, and lack of resources.  To them, the second-greatest injustice imaginable is for those \[they perceive to be\] on the bottom \[of social hierarchy\] to have access to the rights, credibility, and resources reserved for those on top. The first greatest injustice is for those on top to be bound by the restrictions, scrutiny, and lack of resources reserved for those on the bottom.  Conservatives absolutely need an underclass \[for society\] to demonize and dehumanize in order to maintain \[their\] hierarchy, and every single one of their policies and rhetoric work to do exactly that. ""Know your place"" is their mantra.",Shido_Ohtori,2025-05-10T17:58:17,1
And she played it very well.  Even with the things I disagree with her on you can’t say she didn’t show the instrument respect and honor.,bigChungi69420,2025-05-09T17:22:27,21

The media's job is apparently to lie about how this sexist racist piece of shit isn't any of those things.,Ok_Mixture4917,2025-05-09T17:17:00,6
Lizzo did go to college for classical music as a flutist so was experienced with the instrument. Her career trajectory may be quite different than classical music but makes sense she would know how to play the flute well.,cjh42,2025-05-09T17:26:42,21
