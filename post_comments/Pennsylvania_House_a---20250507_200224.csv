This one needs to be DOA. HATE the LCB state store model for selling it. The infrastructure is there to use dispensaries to sell it. Just wacky to use state run stores. Yuck,StaticNegative,2025-05-07T22:34:21,7

"Legal? Only just! Imagine how much sugar you will need to eat and how much packaging you will need to waste just to catch a mild buzz with PA's proposed limits. 25% MAX limit on flower (42g maximum quantity). 5% limit on edibles and a maximum package size of 25mg.

"Live THC content and THCA are different. THCA is an acidic precursor to THC. THCA goes through a process called decarboxylation aka burning, at around 225 degrees Fahrenheit. About 87.7% of THCA will convert to THC. To do the math on how much total thc is actually in your product. The ratio is (thca x 0.877) + thc= total potency.   So let's say hypothetically you got a 25% thc cart with 43% thca... 43%x .0877= 37.7%+25%= 62% total thc.   Sure it wouldn't be the greatest out there but if your going to smoke based off potency alone you mine as well call yourself a weed crackhead instead of stoner chasing for that next high. If your tolerance keeps you from getting high, take a break, 2 weeks should clear you out. It's rough the first 3 days afterwards it's just the urge to smoke... if you also smoke nicotine it makes it slightly easier, if you don't I would try any non nicotine devices like Fum or CBD",Waterwaves007,2025-05-08T11:47:23,1

"Ehh‚Äî   First- Prices‚Ä¶ although MSOs can be awful, the competition in several states have led to prices being low and competitive. With a state run institution that will not be so. Additionally, the selections will be severely limited due to arbitrary rules (whether they cap potency, for example. Do you really want legislatures telling you which brands and the like can be purchased?)  Locations -  people who live in specific areas may be screwed due to not having anything in their community, and if they don‚Äôt have a car, that makes it worse.   SEPTA, for example, may be losing regional rail routes as well as bus routes. Who knows how screwed some folks will be in conjunction with the above.   Limited selection pt 2- Most of the stores in PA who are already vertical have the product. The state does not. So‚Äîare they going to dictate the wholesale terms which will erode these companies and your selections will become more and more limited (potentially, it depends on terms)?  Edit: removed the line item about hours. People have (rudely or not, they‚Äôre right) pointed out that they close at 9, now. Times I used were outdated.",Mr_Horsejr,2025-05-08T05:52:21,2

I'm just explaining that chasing the highest potency isn't always the case when it comes to weed and the difference between THC and THCA.   Alot of new smokers will see the 25% as a low number and be deterred to find something better without understanding more than the basic knowledge of weed.

Quality of the store varies from wildly by location.
