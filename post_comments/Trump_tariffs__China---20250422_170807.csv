Really sounds like they are going to call Trump to negotiate. /s,CouchCorrespondent,2025-04-22T17:12:05,14
So that totally doesn’t sound like China and Trump are close to a tariff deal so idk what’s up with the markets thinking that they are.,greyhoundbrain,2025-04-22T18:09:55,7
"It doesn't take a genius to see that for Trump loyalty only goes one way. You bow down to him and only him, and even if you grovel and give him everything he wants that still does not mean you are safe from being thrown under the bus.   Heck the man threw his own kids under the bus. During that court case in New York, he tried to blame Trump Jr for falsifying business records.",NoPomegranate4794,2025-04-22T18:16:16,2
