There's no country that will be launching missiles regularly enough to warrant any kind of dome.  Also Israel's Iron Dome only has to defend a relatively small border.  Defending even ONE border on the continental US would be way more expensive than this... and honestly impossible anyway. It's just too much land. We wouldn't even have the manpower or like... *energy* to defend that length.  It's dumb as fuck.  It's like building his border wall - which was also highly ineffective.,ErusTenebre,2025-04-29T03:08:57,2
"Media sanewashing and refusing to speculate about reality. It's an elephant in every room, but we are all quite good at ignoring it, since it's been around for a while.  The reality right now is that all 3 branches of government are under the rule of one group. There IS NO LEGAL ACTION that can possibly turn any of this around in the slightest, until some of his key supporters flip. Nothing you or I can do, nothing a senator can do, and nothing a judge can do. Only Republicans have any legal possibility of ending this.   And they could do it today, or any of the previous 100 days. Alas, they have not.",FrazzleMind,2025-04-29T08:02:35,2
Yeah this shit kills me. I get that poking fun at the Trump administration is easy and gives some dopamine but all it really does is just rile them up without actually accomplishing anything. You're just poking the bear at that point.,VeryGayLopunny,2025-04-29T09:49:18,2

"Not sure if you're meaning that Trump wants a ""physical"" war with Canada?  But, as far as the Golden Dome, I think he just wants another toy. You know that saying: ""He who dies with the most toys wins"". That's him all the way. Remember he said the ""Golden age has just begun"". Or some such crap.
