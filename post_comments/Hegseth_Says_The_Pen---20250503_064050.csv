"A lot of women who voted for his boss are about to get a wake-up call.  To conservatives, a woman is not a human with knowledge, skills, and abilities, worthy of consideration and respect as any man would be. To them, a woman is just another DEI hire.

"As per [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/pete-hegseths-new-eggshells-policy-has-military-women-worried-2025-5) 📰:  - A rash of changes at the Pentagon has been sparking concern among some female service members. Now, a new memo set to potentially bring more change is causing additional alarm.  Since Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth took over the Pentagon, top female officers have been fired, some women’s service histories have been erased, women’s leadership programs have been squashed, and an advisory board focused on women in the military has been dismissed.  Last Friday, Hegseth signed a memo directing a review of equal opportunity programs and the processes for reporting and investigating harassment allegations. Hegseth said the moves, which he’s dubbed the “no more walking on eggshells” policy, would ensure faster and more impartial investigations.  “Too often at the Defense Department, there are complaints made for certain reasons that can’t be verified that have ended people’s careers,” he said in an accompanying video, calling some complaints “nonsense.”  But current and former female service members told Business Insider that they worry potential changes could reverse recent progress in addressing problems like hazing, sexual harassment, racism, and social media misconduct.  Retired Marine Corps Lt. Col. Kate Germano, author of the book “Fight Like a Girl,” told BI that “it seems that those who are at the bottom of the pecking order will be the most adversely impacted by the [latest] change — especially women and people of color.”  A Marine officer who has led investigations told BI the new memo seems “part and parcel with their effort to weaken participation of underrepresented groups.”  “It doesn’t seem like a bad thing to prevent spurious complaints,” she said, speaking anonymously to avoid retaliation. She previously investigated questionable claims but said that she hates “the idea that you could be punished if your command doesn’t agree with you.”  ‘Gutting the program’  The new memo, titled “Restoring Good Order and Discipline Through Balanced Accountability,” orders the dismissal of complaints not substantiated by “actionable, credible evidence.” Such a change could discredit anonymous complaints or harassment that occurs in private, said Rachel VanLandingham, a law professor at Southwestern Law School and former Air Force JAG.  Changes to Department of Defense policies could also have an outsized impact on the lowest enlisted ranks, which make up a large share of historical reports of bias and sex-based discrimination complaints.  Military EO programs are responsible for ensuring personnel are allowed “full and fair opportunity for employment, career advancement and access to programs without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, disability, gender, age, sexual orientation, genetic information or parental status.”  “The programs allow personnel to report discrimination and harassment, and that’s a good thing,” Hegseth said in a DoD news release. “But what’s not good is when these programs are weaponized. Some individuals use these programs in bad faith to retaliate against superiors or peers.”  Hegseth did not provide data on the scope of false allegations made through the military’s EO process, only saying in a video on X that he hears it “all the time.”  The secretary has personally faced what he has said were false allegations of sexual assault. In 2020, Hegseth settled a dispute with a woman who said the former TV host sexually assaulted her. No charges were ever filed. During his confirmation hearing, he said that the situation was “fully investigated” and that he was “completely cleared.”  EO programs have been scrutinized before. Some critics have said the policies make “character assassination” easy for disgruntled personnel.  “There’s things that could be worked on,” VanLandingham said. But with this memo, she said, it seems like “they’re just gutting the program.”  A 2020 investigation by Reuters found that troops file complaints at much lower rates than DoD civilians, suggesting a fear of retaliation among active duty personnel.  VanLandingham said that making a false allegation is an offense that’s already covered by the Uniformed Code of Military Justice, which criminalizes false official statements.  Changes to the EO program could create a chilling effect on victims who might fear reporting harassment, she added, highlighting that some troops may avoid submitting complaints for fear of retaliation or being ostracized.  “I would never tell anyone to make an EO complaint, especially now,” said a female veteran who previously submitted a complaint alleging sexual harassment and said she later faced retaliation. She spoke on condition of anonymity because she is seeking federal employment. BI reviewed related documentation between her and her command.  “If they don’t like you, it’s now definitely a way to get rid of you and adversely affect your career,” she said.  Another woman, who is on active duty, told BI she fears the changes will discourage troops from filing complaints.  “This feels like a slap in the face,” she said.  Unanswered questions  “I guess the biggest question is who decides what is or is not credible information or what is fair,” Germano said. She said the military’s process for internal investigations is already thorny — such investigations are often done by troops with little to no meaningful investigative experience, often bestowed upon them as a secondary duty.  Casting greater doubt on the legitimacy of claims could make things even trickier, Germano said, explaining decisions may be influenced by the perspectives of the command’s senior members, based on their own experiences.  Such biases have likely contributed to patterns of sexual assault investigations that ended favorably for alleged perpetrators who were viewed positively by their leaders, Germano said.  BI asked the Office of the Secretary of Defense whether eyewitness testimony would be considered credible evidence, and what might happen if harassment occurs privately. The office referred to a Friday statement from acting Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness Jules W. Hurst III.  “Protecting MEO and EEO programs and processes is critical to advancing meritocracy and balancing accountability,” the statement read. “The comprehensive review will make certain that these programs and processes are timely, efficient, and effective, and that the tools designed to support them are applied in a manner consistent with our mission and values.”  The advocacy group Protect Our Defenders said that the new memo “sends a stark and chilling message: report misconduct at your own risk.”  “By creating new barriers to justice and threatening retaliation against those who speak up, the Department of Defense is attempting to undo congressionally mandated legal protections — and tip the scales against survivors — with a memo,” the group said.",T_Shurt,2025-05-03T06:57:13,136

"There's a certain brand of evangelical upbringing that a wide swath of the women in this country received and internalized that teaches it is Godly to be subservient. Godly to be the follower, and to submit to your man. That as a woman, this is the righteous and natural thing to do. Conservative men thinking they are better than women and it is their rightful place to dominate them isn't what they will be upset about. They're already under that same belief themselves, or at least willing to go along with a prettied up version of it.  When Conservative women complain about being treated like crap by their male peers, it's not because they are surprised they are seen as inferior men. That part is understood as being part of the social contract of the Man who goes out and provides and the Woman who supports him and keeps his home. It's because the men who are supposed to be their Leader, their Guardian, their Knight is breaking the social contract by not being NICE about it. Guys like Nick Fuentes take all the romance of surrendering the difficulties of independence to a benevolent protector out of the relationship, paring it down to JUST men dominating women and treating them like baby-machines or servants. That's what they object to. Not being told they are the lesser sex, but the fact that it's being done without even the pretense of doing it nicely.  At least, that's my read on it.",RainyRobin,2025-05-03T16:01:45,15

"Good grief. I wish these dudes would try being a woman in the Army for one week. At least back even I was in it wasn't for the faint hearted. The number of, ah, let's just say indecent proposals you get and the sometimes graphic language that comes with it would make the most hardened Alpha male blush. Then there's the crude jokes and stories. The occasional handiness. If you were lucky that's all you got, if you were unlucky you got raped.    The attitude of derision until you proved yourself able to keep up - which I understand, but really you'd better do a lot more than keep up. You'd better work harder and make fewer mistakes than anyone there because that's the only way to be treated anything like equally.    And no, you didn't report anything unless it was egregious and even then. If you couldn't prove it it was unlikely that anything would come from it and everyone knew that. You got a real thick skin real fast and learned to handle it on your level. Hesgeth is tripping. There are almost no false accusations. Most of those deemed false are probably the perpetrators circling the wagon with their own command team.     Women who were raped suffered a double assault. The actual attack. And the loss of trust in the people anyone the Army is supposed to trust their lives with, the members of their unit. The best case scenario, you could get transferred to a new unit and start over while trying to recover from the attack. But a lot of times women were just isolated, marginalized, scapegoated and finally discharged for things like personality disorder that could preclude them from help at the VA, since this was considered a pre existing condition despite the fact that half the people discharged with it were either PTSD, TBI or sexual assault survivors.    Hug Feckswith and all his ilk.

They saw ‘secretary’ in some of those roles and just assumed that’s a woman’s job (half joking),Viridis13,2025-05-03T09:14:35,20
"That's an easy one, and thank you for asking.   Trump appointed some women whose every word falls in line with his policies, in some cases as a reward for demonstrated loyalty to Trump over good sense, scientific authority, or the law of the land. In one notable case, a cabinet member had donated millions to Trump's campaign.   They are all disproportionately inexperienced for positions of such authority.   This directly counteract the idea that Trump is inclusive of women who are appropriate candidates for the job.  Specifically relevant to the Hegseth statement, the administration is trying to eliminate protections against sexual harassment. Arguably these protect men as well, but straight men are usually the parties holding power and using their positions to get away with harassing women. Guys like Hegseth, who apparently has difficulty controlling his behavior, don't want to be held accountable for it.  This is a particularly egregious statement given that women are not only disproportionately harmed by sexual harassment, but also by military sexual assault (MSA).   An alternative question: given that this administration is misogynist by policy (one example is the removal of documents and photographs from the military archives showing historical achievements by women as part of Hegseth's DEI purge), is having a cabinet that includes women a way to deflect accusations of misogyny? (Despite the fact that all the women in the cabinet are yes-men, if you'll pardon the phrase.)",Ladiesbane,2025-05-03T09:54:51,19
"It's probably better to judge the administration on its actions and the consequences of those actions than it is to judge the administration on the basis of who it chose to carry out its orders.    Getting absorbed with attempting to establish motivations is a bad practice in this case.    I wish people would focus on the consequences of policies more than the moral character or rationale of the responsible parties, but I also understand how difficult that is when there has been such a massive shift away from the norms that held elected officials to a certain minimum standard of civil decorum and respectfulness for most of centuries long history of the US.  The ethical flavor of this era is so salient and alarming, but well-meaning and polite incompetence can cause equivalent damage.  It's the policies, not the personalities, which people should try harder to understand, but policies are hard to understand, and so regular folks use the worst kinds of heuristics to replace the difficult intellectual work of reading, like, ""he seems like a guy you could have a beer with,"" or, ""he seems like a total asshole.""",SamuelDoctor,2025-05-03T09:47:15,15
