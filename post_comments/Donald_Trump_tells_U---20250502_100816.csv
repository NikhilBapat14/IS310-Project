"This is the path to elected office as a Republican. First, have very public freakout fight--chase around a high schooler who witnessed a mass shooting, or stalk a library intern. Fight with a service worker, or berate someone--cellphone footage preferred, then Republicans rally around them, make them candidates, and MAGA votes them in.",localistand,2025-05-02T10:12:40,10
