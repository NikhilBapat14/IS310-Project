The thing they *don't mention* is that, since this whole shit has started, the US has lost *proportionally more jobs* than that 10M.  10 million in China is approximately 1.4% of their total working population.  The US - since this bullshit has started - has already fared worse, with 2.2% of the nation's workers losing their jobs.

Trump has prepped his base by telling them it is going to get worse before it gets better and they have to be prepared for short term pain for long term gain. Getting laid off is a sign the plan is working, all they have to do is be patient and the riches will come. If the shelves are bare it is because they Chinese are no longer taking advantage and they just have to wait until the factories open and the shelves will be filled with American made stuff. No matter how bad it gets, it is proof the plan is working and they just have to wait and they will all be rich.",kevin402can,2025-04-30T14:19:35,16

"Some tidbits,   > The U.S. economy shrank by 0.3 percent in the first quarter of 2025, marking the country's first contraction in three years. The news of weak GDP figures came just as a parallel development unfolded abroad: China's economy grew faster than expected, expanding by 5.4 percent.   >  > ""Trump wanted to show strength this week. Instead, the numbers showed weakness,"" said Joseph Foudy, professor at NYU's Stern School of Business. ""The U.S. economy is reacting to the disruption. China, for now, is getting a lift."" >  > That lift came in part from a final surge in exports to the U.S. before new tariffs took effect. According to CNBC, Chinese shipments to America rose more than 12 percent in March, helping drive Beijing's quarterly growth. >  > ""This is a self-inflicted slowdown,"" Foudy said. ""Major business decisions are on hold. No one wants to expand or hire under this kind of unpredictability."" >  > ""This is entirely the responsibility of the Trump administration,"" said Belt. ""They inherited a strong economy—low unemployment, falling inflation, and market optimism around deregulation and pro-growth policies."" >  > Representative Brendan Boyle, the top Democrat on House Budget Committee, on the GDP report: ""Donald Trump has done something truly remarkable—in just 100 days, he's taken a strong economy and driven it toward a recession. This GDP report ends the myth that he can be trusted on the economy"" >  > The Trump administration has softened its rhetoric on China in recent days amid rising pressure to secure a deal and growing fears of a recession.",tech57,2025-04-30T18:49:06,5

"OMG think of the children, er, think of the jobs, is just distraction, same thing with empty shelves.   China Just Turned Off U.S. Supplies Of Minerals Critical For Defense & Cleantech   https://cleantechnica.com/2025/04/05/china-just-turned-off-u-s-supplies-of-minerals-critical-for-defense-cleantech/   > What China did wasn’t a ban, at least not in name. They called it export licensing. Sounds like something a trade lawyer might actually be excited about. But make no mistake: this was a surgical strike. They didn’t need to say no. They just needed to say “maybe later” to the right set of paperwork. These licenses give Beijing control over not just where these materials go, but how fast they go, in what quantity, and to which politically convenient customers. >  > The U.S.? Let’s just say Washington should get comfortable waiting behind the rope line. The licenses have to be applied for and the end use including country of final destination must be clearly spelled out. Licenses for end uses in the U.S. are unlikely to be approved. What’s astonishing is how predictable this all was. China has spent decades building its dominance over these supply chains, while the U.S. was busy outsourcing, divesting, and cheerfully ignoring every report that said, “Hey, maybe 90% dependence on a single country we keep starting trade wars with and rattling sabers at is a bad idea.” >  > Try ramping up your semiconductor fab or solar plant when your indium source just dried up. It’s a fun exercise in learning which of your suppliers used to be dependent on Beijing but never mentioned it in the quarterly call. >  > The materials China just restricted aren’t random. They’re chosen with the precision of someone who’s read U.S. product spec sheets and defense procurement orders. Start with dysprosium. If your electric motor needs to function at high temperatures—and they all do—then mostly it is using neodymium magnets doped with dysprosium. No dysprosium, no thermal stability. No thermal stability, no functioning motor in your F-35 or your Mustang Mach-E. China controls essentially the entire supply of dysprosium, and no, there is no magical mine in Wyoming or Quebec waiting in the wings. If dysprosium doesn’t come out of China, it doesn’t come out at all. It’s the spinal cord of electrification, and right now China’s holding the vertebrae. >  > So here we are.

In 2017, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security predicted that major industries, including automotive manufacturing, would face a shortage of 30 million workers by 2025. Compounding the issue, recruitment demand in the new energy vehicle sector has surged by 32% year-on-year in 2023, according to a report from the China Centre for Information Industry Development. Despite this growing demand, China’s vocational education system has struggled to produce enough skilled workers to fill the gap. Meanwhile, university graduates typically steer clear of blue-collar roles, leaving many manufacturing positions unfilled. >  > UBTech’s ambitious plans have caught the attention of several leading companies.
