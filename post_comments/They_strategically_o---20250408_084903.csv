"Just to be clear... it's a massive victory for The United States of America that people - humans - can be deported to an inhumane El Salvodorian prison camp with no due process? And then when the president refuses to follow a court order to bring them back that's okay?    ... how?  How is that a victory for any ""free"" country?",Strict_Inspection285,2025-04-08T09:58:52,61

"The definition of republic itself is kind of tricky. One just means ""no king,"" which is funny given Trump wants to be king.   But if you go with a republic from the ""republican"" school of thought (which the republican party was originally named in the 1800s) it has more to do with Plato and Aristotle's ""governed by the best,"" or basically, governed by the most competent and highest integrity (which both Plato and Aristotle would have said ""most virtuous"").  Trump is neither competent nor has any integrity. Like most other words, they have no idea what republic means, and just like to play games with words.",austinwiltshire,2025-04-08T10:59:01,7

Every Republican is responsible for this. And they wonder why we don't respect them. They're barely human at this point and more like animals.,drklordnecro,2025-04-08T12:30:53,3

"The problem here is the definition of free speech.  They seem to think free speech explicitly covers lies, even when the effect is like screaming fire in a crowded theater, which is illegal.  The first amendment protects speech, but not speech that incites imminent lawless action or creates a clear and present danger.  IANAL (always a fun acronym) but, I would argue that they have been fostering an environment through their speech to lead to imminent lawless action and is a clear and present danger, but I think it's a high legal bar.   The definitions of the first amendment need to be tightened. People that have a platform above a certain size and could reasonably cause damage.. it should be reevaluated whether they are protected. The whole thing is such a legal minefield that we would need a lot of really really smart people who understand the law to drop partisan politics and convene and make this happen, which is not only extremely unlikely in today's polarized political landscape, but even if we managed to have one, the people who would be rewriting the amendments right now are the last fucking people in the world we would want to.",Plaid_Piper,2025-04-08T16:18:22,1
"This is a current right wing tactic as they fall down the rabbit hole to autocracy and flirt with taking away poor peoples right to vote.  The counter to this is to tell them that a Constitution can literally say anything so naming you system after a type of document tells us nothing about that system, and that multiple descriptive names can be true at the same time: Constitutional Republic, Democratic Republic, Representative Democracy, Liberal Democracy, etc...",Animated_effigy,2025-04-08T16:53:11,1
The primary difference between a democracy and a Republic is that a republic has a constitution to protect people’s rights.,Able-Campaign1370,2025-04-08T18:46:26,1
"Remember how Barack Obama and the democrats owned the government for 6 years, but their dicks were so limp that they allowed a toad person from Kentucky to block all their legislation while bragging about it on the news?  Remember a few days ago when kamala told us all she told us so and laughed in our fucking faces?  Republican or Democrat, it makes no difference. The rich don't fucking care about you.",nolando1088,2025-04-09T02:37:31,1

">El Salvodorian prison camp with no due process  The ruling was bad, but even the majority opinion say due process must be afforded to them and adequate notice. It seems to just screw those already in El Salvador as another court case must be filed for that. It is also obviously bullshit they don't take on whether act itself is constitutional in how used",soldiergeneal,2025-04-08T10:21:25,20
"Actually, the Supreme Court is going to hamper the Trump Admin.  While the very recent ruling states that Trump and Co. can continue to use the AEA, the ruling explicitly says that:  1.  Those who are about to be deported must be informed that they are being classified and targeted.   2. Due process is now mandatory.    Also, the whole thing is specifically related to individuals suspected of being a part of Tren de Aragua.  So, if they pick up a Mexican they need to first prove that they are in fact a part of this Venezuelan gang.",crucial_geek,2025-04-08T12:11:49,7
