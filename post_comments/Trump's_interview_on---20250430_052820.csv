"it's telling that there are basically no flaired comments here. this sub overall doesn't seem super happy with the tarrifs/economy. otherwise we'd have flaired people here bashing ABC, like we do in the other threads about the same interview",burninator3343,2025-04-30T19:51:29,41
You need a flair usually to be able to comment.  Leftists that try to brigade this sub 24/7 don't have flairs so they keep wasting their time making troll comments that no one will ever see lol.,Rare_Cobalt,2025-04-30T12:55:36,33
Another question then. Are those without flares and have their comments hidden allowed to Up / Downvote?,Key-Monk6159,2025-05-06T12:04:16,1
People without flair. Or liberals rather.,TheVREnthusiast2,2025-04-30T12:55:28,-4
Ah Thank you. I knew about the flair requirement but didn't know about the other comments not being visible. Makes sense now.,Key-Monk6159,2025-04-30T13:24:06,10
