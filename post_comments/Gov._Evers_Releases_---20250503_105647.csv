"The overtures and the threats bother me so much as  veteran.  I served 8 years thinking this was a country with ideals and principles and beacon of democratic values.  Now I'm jaded as hell. Authoritarian asshats are tearing apart the country letting Trump Russiafy and Chinafy America.   If your ultra rich,  buy a gold visa card for 5 million to lord over the dumb religious factory working underclass that is his bases purpose according to his own administration (Lutnik said Americans will have generations of factory work on fox news the other day).   They're enthusiasticly on board with his administration going against the courts and imposing draconian border laws and subjugating others.   His base is actively on board with Trump positing about sending US citizens to foreign prisons, and his administration now threatening and going after democrat politicians.  The fact a Governor had to make this video to tell his side/to explain it clearly to defend himself from a politicized DOJ and federal govt is crazy.",maninthewoodsdude,2025-05-03T12:19:45,60

He’s priming us.  Dtrumpf is going to start turning the military against citizens. Protesters will be beaten & arrested. The insurrection act will be enacted. He’s already started with an Executive Order that came out yesterday.  People will rise up,Worth-Technology7940,2025-05-03T16:34:11,5

">This admin is really going to push people to actually rise up against a tyrannical government. People are reaching their limit already.  I'm more and more convinced that is the intent. Push and push until the left cracks and takes up more than just peaceful protests.

"The breaking point will likely be @ some of these nationwide days of protest over the coming weeks & months. Oath Keepers, Proud Boys etc. are undoubtedly organizing to prepare infiltrations as we write. This is EXACTLY what Trump wants. He knows that once clashes reach the point where the general public (& govt. officials, ESP. GOP Senators) begins clamoring for the restoration of law & order, he can simply invoke the Insurrection Act & declare martial law. That'd give him the power to postpone/suspend elections (which would freeze the balance of power in Congress & preclude any possibility of another impeachment vote). ",HansSolo69er,2025-05-07T16:48:39,2

"There's actually an old Onion article that says just that  [FBI Uncovers Al-Qaeda Plot To Just Sit Back And Enjoy Collapse Of United States](https://theonion.com/fbi-uncovers-al-qaeda-plot-to-just-sit-back-and-enjoy-c-1819576375/)  Excerpt:  “...We have intercepted electronic communication indicating that al-Qaeda members are actively plotting to stay out of the way while America as we know it gradually crumbles under the weight of its own self-inflicted debt and disrepair,” FBI Deputy Director Mark F. Giuliano told the assembled press corps. “If this plan succeeds, it will leave behind a nation with a completely dysfunctional economy, collapsing infrastructure, and a catastrophic health crisis afflicting millions across the nation. We want to emphasize that this danger is very real.”  “And unfortunately, based on information we have from intelligence assets on the ground, this plot is already well under way,” he added...  “...The warning signs were there all along, but unfortunately we failed to heed them,” said the official, who advised Americans to brace for widespread devastation. “If we’d listened to experts or even our own common sense, we would’ve realized that this plot was being actively orchestrated within our own borders. But we didn’t, and now every one of our citizens and our very way of life is at risk from this threat...”",undercurrents,2025-05-03T12:03:56,33

"There will already be bloodshed now that ICE can just bust into any place/home they just *suspect* have illegal immigrants/migrants/criminals without search warrants.   Think Breonna Taylor...  What's also kind of hanging in the balance is at what point does the military act on that their pledge is to the Constitution, not the president. I highly doubt there will be an actual military coup, but I can imagine there certainly exist a hell of a lot of active military who take their oath seriously and some may decide to act on their own.   I have no doubt blood will be spilled by innocent people as a result of this administration's actions and policies.",undercurrents,2025-05-03T12:12:48,115
