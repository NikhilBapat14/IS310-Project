"So when they said they wouldn't raise prices it kinda seems like they wouldn't raise prices on current inventory but going forward they would raise prices.    Article from 05.02.2025   GM and Ford CEOs Say New Auto Tariffs Won’t Raise Prices—Yet   https://observer.com/2025/05/gm-ford-ceo-trump-tariff-impact/    >General Motors and Ford say consumers shouldn’t expect immediate price hikes on cars, even as the companies brace for the financial hit from President Trump’s newly clarified tariffs on imported autos and parts. GM CEO Mary Barra and Ford CEO Jim Farley both signaled this week that while the levies will cost billions, their companies will absorb the initial impact—at least for now.  From the posted article,  >The price hikes apply only to imported vehicles that were built after May 2. Those models are expected to arrive at dealership lots in late June.",tech57,2025-05-08T05:06:18,1
