"How's this for a deal:   Canada keeps its sovereignty.   Trump falls into a pit full of hungry rats.   That sounds pretty good to me. Trump gets to fuck all the rats he wants, and Canada stays solid.",DoomOne,2025-05-06T20:42:20,27
Canada will always be sovereign! And there is no rush in dealing with Trump as the world around him crumbles under the consequences of deflating an economic war with the entire world.,Sarcasmgasmizm,2025-05-06T20:45:09,15
"The most weak bitch-ass headline I've ever seen.   A mentally deranged pants-shitting fucking idiot just threatened apropos of nothing to annex a sovereign neigboring nation and close ally. For no reason, at the very clear objection of that nation's leader and its people and most of the fucking people in the US. Donald Trump is mentally deranged and only continues to shit up the oval office because of the craven and cowardly capitulation of Republicans in congress who have foresaken their legally-binding oath because they're weak ass bitches who are ""afraid"" of the violence of Trump's rabid, mentally deranged supporters.   Could you journalists and editors please stop being so fucking weak as to not just fucking say that in your headline?   The fucking sanewashing is going to drive me fucking insane.",StoppableHulk,2025-05-06T20:56:35,28
It’s rich that the headline makes it seem like there could have been some kind of agreement on the 51st state crap. Pathetic,Internal_Swing_2743,2025-05-06T21:17:00,9
"The GOP in my life has brought eight years of Bush, eight years of Trump, more spending than the democrats and more usurpation of the constitution and expansion of government power than Clinton or Obama could have ever dreamed of. Why does this party still exist?",Prestigious-Ad54,2025-05-06T20:59:17,6
"I’m amazed Carney even visited with all the crap Trump talks. In front of the press he still gave him lots of verbal jabs, Carney trying to look past it I guess…",Initial-Toe-9512,2025-05-06T20:51:33,5
"Why are we writing this headline as if the 51st state thing is coming from the mind of a sane person? Shame on you, AP.",Independent-End-2443,2025-05-06T23:37:33,4
Far more likely US states leave the union and become new Provinces of Canada than for Canada to ever becomes a state.,Deep_Alps7150,2025-05-07T07:00:36,1

"Alright, so, despite what Trump allowed Carney to comment on, have we decided on a winner yet?  This is being bet upon in jurisdictions outside North America, and they need a winner.    Also lmfao.",Postom,2025-05-06T21:03:32,0
"Why does everyone say 51st State?  Canada has Provinces & Territories, we have States & Territories here in the US. It would only be fair if each Province became a State. Right?    So they’d become 10 States, one for each Province. That means 20 Senators, and they’d get a fair share of Congressional Reps too.  Enough to change the balance of Congress.",Koren55,2025-05-06T21:37:50,-6
Can we negotiate on the means?,Postom,2025-05-06T20:57:41,5

"Carney has his own duty to appear strong and show his people that he is representing their interests.   Most Canadians still want to be our neighbors, and still they want to work with us.   They also want to see their leaders standing up to us when ours act like bullies, not avoid interacting with them. Because that’s what it is going to take to mend the friendship and partnership our nations have had for generations.   Carney knows nothing productive will come out of a meeting with a man like Trump, unless he gives Trump something he wants. But he made it very clear he’s not going to just hand over the keys to the kingdom. That was the real purpose behind that meeting.  Nothing upsets and destabilizes Trump more than when a real adult in the room treats him like an adult, with respect but firmness. Men like Trump don’t know how to deal with that because they hate facing accountability for their behavior. At a glance it may not seem like indulging Trump for a meeting really does that on its own, but the point is not that they had a meeting.   The point is that Carney directly confronted Trump over his shenanigans while going out of his way to show him that Carney is not going to give him the response he wanted. He’s not going to get upset or unbalanced like Trump would. He’s going to act like an actual head of state and keep his composure. It’s a good way to deal with a person like that, for a lot of reasons. Not sure if one would say it’s a perfect political strategy, but I think I see the angle he is playing at there, considering how many Canadians (and Americans) are already fairly upset with him. He doesn’t need to add fuel on the fire or act all tough. Trump is more than capable of undermining himself on his own, obviously. He’s playing the long game in that sense.",nikolai_470000,2025-05-06T21:55:08,0
"You thought too much and missed 3 territories  The answer, was already, long time, no.  The indigenous, and 95% of Canadians said no.  The answer is no.  Insurgency on the scale of 1812 on steroids is what comes next.    Stop talking about it.",Postom,2025-05-06T21:53:33,13
Why are you mulling over something that will never happen.,dfk156,2025-05-06T22:30:27,9
How about everyone just stops saying 51st state and contemplating how it would work. Canada will never be part of the US.,readersanon,2025-05-06T22:42:25,7
After your new edit: Canada becomes no US state and remains 10 provinces and 3 territories of the independent state that is known as Canada -- since 1867.    And comgress is your fucking problem.,Postom,2025-05-06T22:47:17,4
