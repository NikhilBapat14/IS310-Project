"I wish more people understood how impactful Trump‚Äôs dismantling of academia is/will be. We‚Äôve been a country of great minds for centuries. Now we have a president who thinks intellect and truth is a threat. Even in my human research training course, the modules were marked with a warning that the ethical and procedural requirements for human trials could now differ from the course content due to Trump‚Äôs EOs.

"They never liked the scientific method, really. All that hypothesis testing and critical thinking challenging their biases and assumptions was incredibly taxing for them all along. Bothersome.  And it was getting pervasive. Kids were learning it in school and starting to question the scam.   So they went to cut the roots of their discomfort, science and education.   All because they cannot abide by the simple maxim:  Trust only in verified truth.",1984isAMidlifeCrisis,2025-05-01T05:42:11,7
"I have written about this a few times.  My fianc√© is a doctor working at a major hospital chain in a blue state.    She called to see about working remote from Canada or Ireland.  Turns out that 75% of the female doctors in the hospital have made similar inquiries.  You are not going to be able to see a doctor in person anymore.  Forget surgeries, etc.    We're organizing ourselves to leave and have already applied overseas.  I have status in Canada/UK but we want to be part of the EU.

"The decades-long attack on humanities has helped this along. People thought it was cool to undervalue humanities, tell students to avoid those fields, and direct funding to the money-making field in stem.   The end result of that is we got people who don‚Äôt understand how the government works, don‚Äôt know history so lack contextual knowledge for understanding the world, and can‚Äôt think critically about anything. Add to that, we now have stem majors who think anything they do is the most amazing thing ever and they don‚Äôt need any input because they know how to code.

"There will be scientific papers that demonstrate legitimate pros and cons to circumcision, there's nothing wrong with that given so many people are already circumcised and continue to be circumcised. I seriously doubt there is a significant fraction of scientists and doctors that are advocating for circumcision and I seriously doubt that the scientific consensus is that circumcision is a good thing.

"I vehemently disagree with your statement that there is nothing wrong with that and it disgusts me that people think this way, however I understand you may not fully comprehend the entirety of the situation. These pro circumcision scientific papers are cited constantly by people that want to promote it. Even not if by name they will reference it. For example, statements such as ‚Äúthere was a study that proved circumcision prevents HIV so by doing this they will have a less chance of contracting that.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know your scientific background but if you know anything about the transmission of HIV you would question how in the world circumcision could possible prevent that. The answer is it doesn‚Äôt, despite the study claiming otherwise. This is because in the study they didn‚Äôt highlight the fact they gave condoms to people who were circumcised and not to the group who weren‚Äôt. So therein lies the problem, material such as this is being used to convince people with less scientific background to have this operation done.  Who would want to have there baby get HIV, STDs, UTIs? All manipulative hyperbole. This doesn‚Äôt even address the argument of it being a violation of autonomy.   Circumcision is a in the vast amount of cases is unconsensual. It completely ignores the autonomy of the patient by having it done against there will. Putting aside that it ignores basic human rights, it  also causes great loss of sexual function and tissue. People tend to not realize that it is a surgery and that it goes wrong quite often. It is a surgery with a 2% complication rate. Meaning 2% of circumcisions are reported to have something wrong happen such as massive blood loss, amputation or even death. This is one of the highest complication rates there is and it for a surgery that the patient never consented to. People have also been left with horribly disfigured genitalia for life because of this operation, something they were never given the choice for.   Circumcision itself is a quick surgery that generates a lot of profit for the medical system. Foreskin is also highly used in research. This is why I stated it is profit motivated, when American science is not in the interest or benefit of the people. Circumcision is illegal and almost non existent in many other countries.

This is because in the study they didn‚Äôt highlight the fact they gave condoms to people who were circumcised and not to the group who weren‚Äôt.   Yeah I mean, assuming this study you're referencing exists, it is so comically bad and unscientific that this isn't what I or any scientifically minded person would refer to as medical research. I also seriously doubt that anybody with a scientific or medical background who had bothered to read a paper like that would ever cite it as a piece of evidence in favour of circumcision (especially given it doesn't even make sense on a theoretical level how circumcision could reduce the transmission of AIDS).   I feel like you're almost certainly pretending this is some huge issue when really your evidence is only that some no-name quacks who are ridiculously ideologically driven end up using research like this as an argument for circumcision. Most people will just advocate for circumcision for reasons like ""I'm circumcised and it's fine"" or ""it looks better"" or ""it's cleaner"" or ""this is how we do things as *insert religion*"". Nobody is going to be like ""Well we need to circumcise our kid because it reduces the risk that they get AIDS... in the United States of America where AIDS is barely even a thing...""  > Circumcision is a in the vast amount of cases is unconsensual.

"Thanks for the talk. It‚Äôs my own personal experience with discussion on the topic as more often than not studies such as that are referenced. Even here on reddit I‚Äôve replied to people making those exact claims referencing studies such as the one mentioned. Again though, my own personal anecdotal evidence so it‚Äôs completely understandable to be hesitant in believing statements such as that. I do believe it‚Äôs much more than a cultural or religious reason to explain its prevalence it has in America but there is no doubt in those being significant factors.   Good feedback though, going forward I‚Äôll try to be as factual as possible when discussing it. Have a good day.",Blue_eyed_Otaku,2025-05-02T10:06:48,1
