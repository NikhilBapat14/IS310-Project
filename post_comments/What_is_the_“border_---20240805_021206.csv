"A large number of migrants, mostly from unstable central and south American countries like Venezuela, are traveling to the U.S. to seek asylum.  The current U.S. law limits the number of legal immigrants from each country. You can't use that process if you just show up at the border.  However, you can legally cross the border and request asylum, basically if you say that you're running for your life and returning home would jeopardize the health and safety of your family.  By the numbers, most asylum claims are *denied*, however some are granted.  However, the U.S. asylum system is woefully underfunded. There aren't resources to hear everyone's claim. So, when someone arrives and seeks asylum, we release them into the country until we have time to hear their asylum claim.  Is the effect of all of this ""open borders""? No, but I can see how someone might think so.  There is relatively little that the president and executive branch can do about this. They can't change the asylum law. They can't hire more border agents without funding.  In February 2024, Democrats and Republicans in congress agreed on a new bill that would increase funding for border security and add new asylum restrictions.  After both parties negotiated and agreed on the terms, Trump came out against it and told Republicans to vote it down. He didn't want Biden to get a ""win"".  The real problem here isn't that it's not solvable or that nobody knows what to do. Republicans don't actually want to do anything about the border, they just want to have an issue to blame on the Democrats. Solving it would get rid of that issue.",dmazzoni,2024-08-05T15:28:39,29
"Its a pretty complex issue, with both sides focusing on different facets of the issue.   Republicans typically focus on the criminal aspect of illegal border crossings, think Cartels and their drug/human trafficking. This is the reason they give for wanting to build the wall and patrol the borders more strictly  Democrats typically focus on the asylum seekers and people fleeing in hopes of finding a better more stable life away from the civil unrest in countries like Venezuela and the Cartel run parts of Mexico.   Typically when talking about what Biden may have done Republicans will bring up a deal Trump made with Mexico where any asylum seekers would have to stay in Mexico while they wait for the asylum request to be processed. Biden overruled pretty much all of Trumps border policies hours after he entered office.   Democrats on the other hand will bring up the bi-partisan immigration bill that got killed earlier this year. It's widely claimed that Trump had the bill killed because a worse border would help with his reelection bid, the border situation / wall has been one of, if not his main, talking points since the start of his political career.  These are the main points I see coming up recently, anyway. Like with anything political there's a lot of history here that's pretty hard to encapsulate in one post.",LMandragoran,2024-08-05T15:17:12,8
"I just watched a FANTASTIC documentary on this topic, it’s called *The River and the Wall* and it brings up so many logistical challenges for no benefit. We’re literally blocking our farmers from accessing water for their crops in some areas. ",vand3lay1ndustries,2024-08-06T02:10:56,3
"To some extent, Republicans have been exaggerating (fear mongering) the issue for political purposes.  Having said that...  There were more people entering the US, waiting for trial, than we could process. Biden tried to pass a bill, but it was blocked by Republicans (because Trump didn't want Biden to have a win). So Biden passed an executive order limiting the amount of people who enter for asylum, which improved the situation significantly.   Currently...  >While crossings have been declining for months, U.S. officials have attributed the steep decrease in illegal border crossings in recent weeks to a proclamation issued by President Biden in early June that has dramatically curtailed access to the overwhelmed U.S. asylum system.  >Source:  [https://www.cbsnews.com/news/unlawful-border-crossings-drop-5th-straight-month-lowest-level-since-september-2020/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/unlawful-border-crossings-drop-5th-straight-month-lowest-level-since-september-2020/)",snappydo99,2024-08-05T22:35:01,2
"I found this article to be a helpful comparison: [Trump vs. Biden on immigration: 12 charts comparing U.S. border security](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2024/02/11/trump-biden-immigration-border-compared/). I'd suggest leaning into what actions border states' have taken in the last several years - Texas and Arizona share the most border with Mexico.   My friend's mom (a Latina woman) gave a wonderful analogy on illegal immigration... . Her client (also a Latina woman) made comments against ""closing the border,"" implying that it was heartless and cruel because these people are coming from countries with political instability, human rights violations, etc. The conversation went like this: Imagine you see two homeless people on the street. Out of compassion, you might feel inclined to help them. Now, what if someone told you, 'You must take those two strangers into your home immediately.' Your instinctive response might be, 'Wait, I don’t know these people. I don’t know their background, their intentions, or if they pose any risk to me or my family.'  The same concept goes for our border. While compassion is crucial so is setting boundaries. Just like you wouldn't invite strangers into your home without knowing anything about them, a country must have a process to ensure that those entering are vetted and can contribute positively to society. We have to balance empathy with the need to protect and ensure the integrity of our country/our home.  I have many close friends and their parents who immigrated here legally many year ago. I have friend's family members currently in the process of immigrating here legally. MOST people want to do it the right way. I personally do not believe that *most* people coming through the border are honest or have good intentions.   Check out JorgeVenturaTV on instagram. He reports right on the grounds of the border. Might give you direct insight. As always, read, learn and form your own conclusions over time.",pware2,2024-08-09T12:09:47,1

There are a lot of real estate up for grabs if he targets house holds. Many other focused deportation efforts can easily be mistaken for a bid to remove competition. Just looking at the surface level of things can make it seem random.,tidnus,2024-11-11T16:23:10,1

"Long story short:   We destabilized a bunch of countries and so millions their citizens are fleeing their shitty situation in hopes of a better life in the U.S.   These migrants are legally seeking asylum, but using loopholes in the law to enter the country first.   When they say ""close the border"" they essentially mean close the loopholes.

"When Biden came into office he signed 91 Executive Orders opening the border. He got rid of every border policy Trump had instated. Trumps policies were working.   As soon as the orders were signed people started flooding to the border. Under Biden border policy he has allowed 8million illegals to come into this country. With 85-90% being released into the US with little to no vetting. And that’s not including the 2 million got aways (illegals who snuck in undeterred because they couldn’t be caught.  This mass influx of illegals is putting huge strains on hospitals, schools, resources across the country. Some cities are offering illegals housing, food, free medical , and in some cases voting rights.  Illegals also tend to take jobs that lower income individuals typically fill. Yet the illegals will work for less, therefore taking jobs.  And many illegals have been caught robbing, raping, and killing our citizens.  During the Trump years there were a total of almost 3 million illegals that crossed. That’s in 4 years. Biden has allowed 11million n 3 1/2years. And. Unlike Trump who deported everyone who wasn’t a true asylum seeker. Biden, on the other hand, has a catch and release policy. Allow people to violate our immigration laws by crossing illegally, then letting them go into the country with an order to appear before a judge years out.   There IS a border crisis. Just ask anyone in border states and most major cities. New York, Chicago, Denver, etc. all over run with illegals pissing residents off.",Psykotik10dentCs,2024-08-05T17:48:42,-6
"Is it true that there is a much higher influx of immigrants crossing the border now compared to Trump’s administration? If so, were there policies that should have been kept in place that Biden shot down upon becoming president? Thanks for taking time to read.",BigJugs_,2024-08-05T18:05:31,3
"This is an extreme underwhelming narrative of what's actually happening on the border. Saying the president can't do anything about the U.S. border crisis is just not true, also blaming the situation on its asylum seeking process underwhelms how vast of a network there is of illegal crossing of the border as well as the vast amount of countries who capitalize on this basically open border. I know many people who have worked the border (national guard) and work in a capacity that gives me open channels into what's actually taking place there.    Devolving this into ""republicans bad Democrats good"" completely takes any legitimacy out of your claims. Why wouldn't both parties care about mass amounts of illegal crossing into their country with completely unvetted citizens? ",[deleted],2024-11-05T15:26:34,1

"Yes, but it's due to instability in central and south America, not due to policy differences.  Trump faced a huge influx at one point, and his administration dealt with that situation by separating children from their parents, which has been called one of the most cruel things ever done by the U.S. government in history. Even today some children still haven't been reunited.  Again, the one who needs to act here is Congress. Only Congress can change immigration or asylum law. Only Congress can increase funding for border security.

"I see. This clarifies a lot. So the reason that Biden ended those Trump policies were due to moral reasons. There were families already in the United States, but they were separated.

When in actuality, it is congress who are not agreeing to any policies, which also sound very campaign driven as to not give democrats any credit and to make them look worse.",BigJugs_,2024-08-05T18:56:28,8
