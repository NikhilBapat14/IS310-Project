"Step 1) Create a divisive issue where there was previously consensus.  Step 2) Focus on this and fight over it.   It's all purposeful distraction because they think these are arguments they can win, vs other issues ***that actually matter*** they want to avoid talking about because they don't have good answers. Like for the status of health insurance in this country. Serious debate using facts is strictly forbidden.",cache_me_0utside,2025-05-08T10:05:02,8
