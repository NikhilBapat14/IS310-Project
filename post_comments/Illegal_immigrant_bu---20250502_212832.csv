This only makes me sad and very angry at previous administrations for allowing us to arrive at this point. I know most illegal immigrants come here for a better life and most donâ€™t do anything terrible. They should never have been led to believe they could just ignore our laws and do this. Just immigrate legally and you can have all the benefits of living here.,Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-05-02T22:00:14,38
