"I don't think that 11 trans women over 12 months is a large enough or thorough enough study to draw a conclusion. This is also only a measure of knee strength, which factors into various sports in different ways. Again, not a definitive advantage. Would you have trans women compete in mens sports? By your logic, they'd be at a significant disadvantage. Furthermore, should we just ban intersex people from professional sports? You can't normalize everyone's genetics and have sports be purely skill based.   At least we agree this isn't a federal issue. Sports organizations are perfectly capable of regulating this issue themselves, and had done so for decades before this became political.   You're not a female athlete, women don't need you to defend them on reddit.

"No?  What legislation exactly do you think they'd be passing?  There are only so many rights people can be given and the few trans people don't currently have are being debated and legislated on; I'm not sure what legislation you'd want passed beyond equality.    You're not listening to me or the other person at all and I'm not sure what point you're even trying to make here.  I don't know about the other person's views but I completely support trans rights; I'm just saying I hear about it a disproportionate amount and in inappropriate contexts and so is the other person. I'm saying I hear about it way too much from Dems, and that's all.  What do you think you're going to gain by going ""nuh uh""?  Again, I agree with you about the actual rights, so all you're doing now is denying that reality exists.  I've personally seen comments online and heard them in person; I've been at pro-Palestine protests where the organizers didn't actually talk about Palestine but talked about trans rights issues while waving Palestinian flags.  I've seen dozens, possibly over 100, comments saying stuff like ""sure genocide is bad but what do they think of trans people"".  In my training for actually going to Gaza, a cis woman was asking about trans issues--not because it affected her personally but because she I guess thought they'd deserve genocide if they weren't liberal enough and wouldn't go if she didn't hear the right answer.  None of that came from Republicans.  It was all from super super progressive people who make trans issues the #1 priority and link it to everything.  What good does that do?

"You keep calling trans women men and expect me to not think you're being disingenuous. I'm ignoring the other studies cited because I was responding to your last comment specifying a single source. I don't disagree that there is nuance to this issue, but I don't think the statement that it's unfair to cis women to compete against trans women as a generalization is fair to either party. My position is that it directly affects a group to which I belong, that is enough for me to have a valid opinion on the issue. Also, men don't just wake up and decide to become women, transition doesn't work like that. Nobody is willing to uproot their lives and identity for the purposes of winning at sports. People transition so they can live some semblance of a normal life, and so they can try to love who they are. Turning men's sports into ""open division"" doesn't make it fair to trans women or trans men. Apparently, ""fairness to all women"" does not include trans women to you, which, again, makes me believe you are being disingenuous about your argument.   Is it fair when one cis woman has a more muscular physique than another? Is it fair when certain genetics prevail? This whole argument is fucking ridiculous because of the huge variation in human bodies and genetics in either sex. I've met cis women with broader shoulders and bigger arms than me.

"They absolutely are not, at least not the specific ones I'm referring to.  A genocide protest is about genocide; I'm not there talking about my loss of abortion rights in my state.  This is actual genocide we're talking about; all of that is less important than the Israeli blockade has kept all food and medicine out of Gaza for over 2 months and they don't have any water or toilets, plus they're being bombed.  THAT is what's being protested at these events and nothing else; it's completely inappropriate for any issue to try and use the suffering of those poor people to talk about their personal problems.  It's not the place or time; I would be furious if I was speaking about the genocide at a state congressional meeting when they were voting on laws related to the legality of boycotts and someone made it about them.

"Let me give you another example of what I mean when I say the Democrats are equally as obsessed.  In my city, the cops murdered an unarmed black man.  When people started protesting the murder, the cops quit showing up to crime.  Seriously.  I know someone who saw a house burning down and the cops refused, someone who got hit by a drunk driver and the cops wouldn't come, etc.  It's insane.  This isn't me just saying by the way; there are articles about it and the cops have openly said that's what they're doing and why.  In general, trans rights affect a very small number of people, but specifically in my city BLM is something that needs way more support and is a much bigger issue.  But it's not; Democrats still choose to focus on trans stuff over this.  Both in government and just individuals in the city.  There are 3 bars (not gay bars) within a mile of me that have trans flags painted on the buildings or on huge signs, almost all others nearby have rainbow or trans flags in the windows.  The protests all had trans lives matters stuff and were talking about trans rights.  But not a single one of those buildings has a BLM sign or flag.  Why not?  I'm not saying there aren't any of those flats in the city; I'm talking about those specific buildings.  Why can I find buildings with trans flags painted on them but I can't find any acknowledgement that BLM exists?  No talk of women's rights, either, but that's not a cop/city problem like the racism is so I wouldn't expect it to be a thing.  But black people are being ignored and it's really, really irritating to have people cry ""transphobia"" when you don't have a trans flag but no one is calling racism over no BLM flags.  No one calls trans people racist if they're not actively speaking about BLM, but others are called transphobic if they're not actively talking about trans rights.  But it feels deliberately disingenuous for you to deny that trans rights is an issue that's en vogue right now and getting way more attention than other issues, and is getting a disproportionate amount considering how few people it affects. I literally do not believe that you haven't seen examples of what I'm talking about it.  BLM is an issue that's getting ignored in my city while trans rights are getting lots of attention and that's not right.  Racism is a huge problem with the police force and it needs to change, but it's not trendy enough.  Some do this because accusations of transphobia get you cancelled so fast; it's telling that there's no similar concern about being flagged as a racist.",TheAlphaKiller17,2025-05-08T15:11:34,-1

Ultimately, people will be most concerned about things that have a direct impact on their lives no matter where you go.

You provided the example of this happening at protests, and I provided an example in which I believe that could happen without necessarily betraying a single cause.

Surely you can understand the ‘fairness’ issue.  That alone should be enough to change your position.  But if this issue is going to result in potentially millions of votes for the side that is going to rip your rights away from you, don’t you think it that it’s best to have Democrats change their position to defuse that part of the problem?    Politics is a fight… and in fights you need to have your own means of attack, but you also need to counter your opponents.    There’s already a massive fairness issue… and adding that to the efficacy of the other side’s attack, it seems to me like there’s only one clear choice here. ",FightSmartTrav,2025-05-08T14:48:44,0
