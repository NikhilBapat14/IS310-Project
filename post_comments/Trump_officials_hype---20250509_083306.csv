I hope attendance is lower than expected.,Smithy2232,2025-05-09T08:35:30,22
The potential for so many brown people in one place really scares them.,Condyle_1,2025-05-09T08:37:37,9
"Even before a tourist arrives, a threat is made. What great hosts we are. Most football fans are unlikely to have any interest in the USA, they just want to see a few good games.",Spirited-Top3307,2025-05-09T08:37:44,8
Who is this helping?  Threatening tourists is not the way to bring back the tourism industry that is currently on life support.,BlotchComics,2025-05-09T08:42:30,7
"Well so much for boosting tourism to the U.S.  Nothing says more welcome like  - We'll come after you if you stay too long or say or do anything we don't like and if you ever did something say like protesting (in your own country) that we don't like we do have  something very special for you, the Trump administration is offering you a surprise lifetime residence in El Salvador.",ME-SLS,2025-05-09T08:52:58,3
"Unless you are dying and this will be your absolutely last chance to ever attend a World Cup, it would probably be a safe bet not to come to this country to watch this one, especially if you are coming from a ""brown"" country.",noncongruent,2025-05-09T09:17:02,4

"fck Fifa , fck infantino, fck trump. since russia2018 or katar I give a shit.  Support your local club.",paul_wurzel,2025-05-09T09:03:36,3
Why go to the US for this? Won’t there be games in Mexico and Canada as well?,lesmainsdepigeon,2025-05-09T09:22:18,3
I hope no one shows up and the World Cup is a ghost town,Top-Long2653,2025-05-09T11:15:29,3
"They want an international incident. They intend to use it as propaganda. Soccer is a ""liberal"" sport and conservatives hate it.",ToNoMoCo,2025-05-09T08:50:04,2
This is like the Olympics and Germany hosting them. What a schiit show maga all this winning is to much.,Complete-Breakfast90,2025-05-09T09:44:14,2
">Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy echoed the sentiment, saying officials “want everyone to spend a lot of money in America.” But, he added, “Don’t overstay your visa. Don’t stay too long.”  Ah, the tenets of the hospitality industry. ""Get over here and give us your money but hurry up and leave already.""",filthysize,2025-05-09T10:40:15,1
"there's no chance we get boycotted for the World Cup but what is going to happen is the systematic and calculated devaluing and pressure put on main stream media to limit reporting on negative incidents.  This will give the administration the ability to punish anyone with the wrong color skin for any reason.  Minorities will flood into the country and it will be a modern day gold rush for the for profit prison companies who can hold the detainees indefinitely without due process prior to deportation.  It will be bad for anyone visiting the US who isn't a white Christian male with a minimal accent who can speak fluent, native speaker, level English.",Archer1407,2025-05-09T11:47:59,1
I hope entire nations boycott.,fallonyourswordkaren,2025-05-09T10:53:14,8
"A competition at club level that has not been particularly highly rated in the last 25 years. The clubs have fought against it for a long time. There are much higher-rated competitions in the football world. I'd rather go to the World Cup, European Championship, Copa America or Africa Cup of Nations before going to a club competition.",Spirited-Top3307,2025-05-09T08:50:24,1
Probably the biggest matches will be in the US. But yes I wouldn’t blame anyone for going this route.,meTspysball,2025-05-09T09:50:55,1
"…notice you didn’t say anything about homosexuals and transgender people(and yes, they are people even if the GOP won’t treat them as such)",animalslover4569,2025-05-10T01:58:01,1
Agreed.,Smithy2232,2025-05-09T12:50:59,4
Is this meant in response to a different comment?,meTspysball,2025-05-09T09:48:22,3
