"The article gets one thing right that too many don't understand.  They define ""due process,"" correctly.  That does not mean getting a day in court.  It means following an established legal process.",Celebril63,2025-05-07T11:17:32,29

"More than likely it will come to this unless SCOTUS can issue some guidelines for the district judiciary to follow. Executive priviledge to deny entry and deport should be strengthened. There is no feasible way to give 15 million people the kind of legal proceedings the left wants. Besides, precedent does not require it.",social_dinosaur,2025-05-07T08:00:14,47
It does point out the left's self-contradictory ethics that they never law-fared Joe Biden or Barack Obama for their collective four million-plus deportations over 12 years. It just points out that they hate Trump and want to warp the law because of it.,Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-05-07T09:08:35,14

"This is what I find when I do a little research.  The President of the United States can suspend the writ of habeas corpus under specific conditions outlined in the Constitution. According to Article I, Section 9, Clause 2, the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus can be suspended only in cases of ""rebellion or invasion"" when ""the public safety may require it.""   Still though, crossing the border ILLEGALLY automatically makes you a criminal. The fact that they are not US citizens in my opinion automatically fulfills Habeas Corpus.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-07T10:49:48,10

">This was the plan all along, over load the system and throw up your hands *oh we cant possibly adjudicate **this** many cases🤷🏻‍♂️*  This is a mess. By law, everyone deserves fair justice and due process. However, as you so many others have previously stated, even a cursory hearing would overload the legal system, much less the subsequent trials, appeals, and findings. Therefore, the quite possibly most criticized president apparently thinks his best course of action requires him to enact a legal exception done only twice before by a sitting president, each of which having better popular reputations, with the blemish of them doing so being remembered to this day. As with so many events in the past, this solution will be better remembered and more criticized than the events (and agents) leading to the problem (i.e. Trump is going to be forever slammed for suspending habeas corpus and few are going to remember that, during a national quarantine, the Biden government with Kamalla Harris as his ""border czar"" allowed a porous border policy to enable countless people of various health and criminal status to enter the country.)",sherzeg,2025-05-07T13:47:00,17
"Yeah, the thing is that the kind of legal proceedings that the left want aren't what's required for due process in these cases. The left thinks they should all be criminal cases, with a full trial and multiple levels of appeal. But, as they've loved to point out for years, this is administrative law. ICE has a certain level of authority to adjudicate these cases. Above them, there are immigration judges and the Board of Immigration Appeals, all of which are in the Executive Branch, because immigration is handled by the Executive. In the incredibly rare case that something is appealed above the Board of Immigration Appeals, it goes to a Circuit Court and then to SCOTUS.",Mountain_Man_88,2025-05-07T08:39:29,22
"Or if Congress regulates the district courts' scope.  They could attach this to their funding as a condition, which makes sense.  That would avoid the threat of a filibuster.",Celebril63,2025-05-07T11:16:24,2
">everyone deserves fair justice and due process  Here's the thing: how many people being deported missed their hearing date? By failing to appear or attempt to even contact someone to reschedule, they should forfeit their right to an immigration hearing.",Original_Lord_Turtle,2025-05-08T15:48:07,1
"Correct. And in that rare instance of appeal Circuit Court most likely would not hear it, deferring to the authority of the President. At least that's been the precedent. However, in this era of partisan judicial activism one has to wonder.",social_dinosaur,2025-05-07T08:55:54,10
">how many people being deported missed their hearing date? By failing to appear or attempt to even contact someone to reschedule, they should forfeit their right to an immigration hearing.  As I wrote (or implied,) there will be almost endless circumstances and actions that will drag each case out to infuriating lengths. Despite their contempt of the legal system they are still entitled to due process (with additional charges added.) What would be a simple response for one case, or ten, becomes impossible for thousands and ten thousands, much less the numbers involved for this issue.   So now exists the hard question; suspend the rights that make us great, or hold to them with the knowledge that they will certainly be abused. As with so many decisions, I'm glad that it's not up to me to decide whether we should be Dudley Do-right (yes, I know he was a Canadian) or the self-loathing lawmaker.",sherzeg,2025-05-08T16:02:16,2
"I've found doing the right thing is much easier when you stop caring about the court of public opinion - which all too often is comprised of people who couldn't give 2 shits about the right thing. I do agree that I wouldn't want to be the one to make the decision, as suspending right is a serious matter. But I also don't think that giving a court date to people who have zero intention of ever showing up is the right course of action either.",Original_Lord_Turtle,2025-05-08T16:13:51,1
"I agree that considering the court of public opinion is not a factor, though it should not be forgotten how history reflects the two times the suspension of habeas corpus was enacted in the past. My argument involves holding to the established laws and due process, and drawing the time and resources involved to ridiculous proportions, versus suspending certain aspects of the law due to the enormity of the projected criminal base and becoming the villain to a certain extent.  It's not a decision to be made lightly. I personally feel conflicted and would really like to hold to due process for all, no matter the situation, but reluctantly think that suspending habeas corpus in a very controlled manner is the only way to work though all of the cases.",sherzeg,2025-05-08T16:55:45,2
