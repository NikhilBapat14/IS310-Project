">The freshman senator also urged audience members not to refer to Republicans as isolationists.  >He called it “pejorative, offensive even, to working-class Americans to call them isolationists because you from time to time disagree with them about their thoughts about Ukraine or other parts of the world.”  Everything in this is basically Trump's foreign policy with a request not to criticize it.  The only substantial difference is keeping our NATO role and European bases while still pulling out. Vacation home style.",nerphurp,2025-05-01T17:58:21,6

"Here is the beginning of the story:  Speaking on Wednesday at an event organized by the Vandenberg Coalition, Sen. Jim Banks (R-IN) attempted to lay out a middle path forward for conservative foreign policy balancing elements of the internationalism that has long dominated the party and the more restrictionist sentiments that have been ascendant in the Trump era.  The first-term Indiana senator argued that the U.S. has critical interests in the Middle East, in countering the threat from Iran and supporting Israel, even as he leaned into elements of President Donald Trump’s foreign policy that are controversial among Republican traditionalists. He framed that policy as a return to a Reaganite peace through strength approach.  Banks said that the U.S. “cannot accept another bad deal with Iran,” adding that he does not believe Trump would be interested in returning to a deal similar to the Obama-era Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.  Iran, Banks argued, is its weakest position in decades and “the president knows that he holds all the cards, and he knows how to play them. He is also the most pro-Israel president that we’ve ever had, so I fully expect him to put America and Israel’s interests first when it comes to dealing with Iran.”",jewish_insider,2025-05-01T17:42:01,-1
"If you don't want to be called isolationist, then don't support isolationist policies. If you don't like it, then don't use liberal or socialist as a pejorative term.",ianrl337,2025-05-01T18:30:19,3
No mention of Russia? Presumably more knee cushions needed there.,Minguseyes,2025-05-01T17:56:12,2
