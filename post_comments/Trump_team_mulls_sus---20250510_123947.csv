"> unthinking compliance with any executive orders?  Yes.  They deemed any official act of the Executive Office as immune to any criminal charges or intent to charge. Since the Executive Branch determines what is or isn't an official act, there's never going to be any possible room to bring any charges or levy charges against the office it'self.  The only possible outcome is if the Congress held or attempted to impeach those acts, leaving impeachment as the only possible path.  > While an executive order can have the same effect as a federal law under certain circumstances, according to the 2021 CRS report, Congress can pass a new law to override an executive order, but only for those orders enacted “pursuant to powers delegated to the President” by Congress. Conversely, Congress cannot directly modify or revoke an executive order that was issued pursuant to powers granted exclusively to the president by the Constitution. Congress, however, has used several other methods to restrain executive orders; for example, by attempting to withhold spending on programs created by an executive order.  + https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/defining-the-presidents-constitutional-powers-to-issue-executive-orders  + https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/53739/can-the-supreme-court-enforce-its-rulings-on-the-executive-branch  Since all EO's are official acts of the Executive, they also can/or be considered immune to judicial review.  Once again. Congress could attempt to challenge those acts, but with a Republican Congress unwilling to act or challenge any ""official acts"" of the Executive Branch, there's nothing to be done.  The best answer would be to replace those Republicans with Democrats and Independents willing to challenge those acts and EO's.  But the judicial branch can do absolutely nothing about anything. They can whine, complain, order, charge, attempt to do whatever, but it doesn't matter.  Trump and his EO's are immune.  Thus made by SCOTUS.",HonoredPeople,2025-05-10T15:50:11,1
