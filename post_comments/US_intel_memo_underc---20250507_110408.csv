Rather than refocus priorities based on that information Trump will predictably fire the messengers who chose to go against his messaging. His ways are as predictable as they are disgraceful.,AllynCrane,2025-05-07T11:10:39,1
"This should surprise absolutely no one. Lies have been a central part of Trump's public life going back decades. Remember when he pretended to be, Baron, his spokesperson? This effort to deport as many people as possible is based on lies that make it possible for him to feed the base that adores him for deporting immigrants, legal or not, and owning the libs. I don't think he personally cares that much about immigration, but he loves to be worshiped. There's nothing like deporting black and brown people to whip up the bigots who love him. I think they even get a thrill from the Miller acts of real cruelty like deporting children with cancer.",PoetryJunior1808,2025-05-07T11:13:09,1
With Tulsi Gabbard in charge I don’t expect to see many more of these differences in messaging. The Administration will be the final word on what it considers its world view. So if TdA is invading us then that’s what’s happening. The intelligence agencies need to just determine where they got the analysis wrong.,johnn48,2025-05-07T12:46:16,1
I wonder how many right wingers heard about this gang prior to march 2025….,Parking_Bullfrog9329,2025-05-07T12:59:53,1
