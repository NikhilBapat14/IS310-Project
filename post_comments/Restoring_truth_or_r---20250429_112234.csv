"“Federal funding will be contingent upon implementing curriculum that promotes American pride, unity, and moral clarity,”  He really just appeals to the dumbest people in society. Most academic fields are fact based, including history. Either something happened or it didn't happen. No one wants to hear your idealistic fantasy version of U.S. history. Teach what actually happened.
