">So I'm wondering what has changed with immigration policy since he came into office.  Biden, immediately after inauguration, halted construction of the border wall by ending the ""national immigration emergency"" Trump was using to get funds for the wall after being rebuked by Congress. He also ended the ""Muslim ban"" on 14 countries of largely Islamic population. He also immediately reinforced support for the ""Dreamers"", a policy Trump had tried to unilaterally end as well. He also pushed for a Congressional bill that would create a ""pathway to citizenship"" for illegal immigrants in the US.  Biden had appointed Harris to handle international relations for immigration (this is why the right called her the ""border czar""). She wasn't actually tasked with the border, but instead attempted to work internationally to discover the root cause of why the immigrants were coming here and try to develop diplomatic solutions to reduce the need for them to immigrate in the first place.  Biden raised the refugee cap (which was lowered to 15k per year under Trump) to 125k by 2024.  Biden ended Trump's ""Remain in Mexico"" policy, which required people seeking asylum from Mexico to remain in Mexico and return to the US when their court date was set.   Recently, after the failure of the border bill in Congress in spring 2024, Biden has implemented a cap of 2500 illegal migrant encounters daily, with any excess encounters being immediately deported back to Mexico.      There's a lot more individual acts, but generally Biden has supported legal and illegal immigration more, attempted to act more ""humanely"" to these illegal immigrants, and reverted back to more of Obama's stance on immigration, though he's recently taken a more hard line as illegal immigration surges.  >Are we close to approaching open border policy? Is it all just overblown?   It is an issue, as illegal immigration is certainly up. But in no way is it an ""open border"" policy, and Border Patrol continues to do their job and deportations and encounters continue to rise.   We are not approaching an open border policy, but we could certainly use more funds, BP agents, and immigration judges and attorneys to make the border operate better.",ProLifePanda,2024-08-01T09:21:52,3
By illegal do you mean the migrants just have to claim asylum and they will be left alone?,-_-_-0,2024-08-01T11:52:19,1
"You have expressed this well.   I wanted to say something similar. You can have policies to keep immigrants out and remove them when you find them, sort of like playing wack-a-mole. Alternatively, you can address the conditions making people want to leave their home country.  IMHO, The US is guilty of interfering in Latin American affairs for many years. It’s possible we have caused some of the problems. I hope there is a future where political refugees from the South can and want to return to their home countries. I like to believe this is more important than playing wack-a-mole.",stebak52,2024-08-26T17:02:05,1
">By illegal do you mean the migrants just have to claim asylum and they will be left alone?  This would depend on the specific section above you're talking about.  But you're correct that it isn't illegal to claim asylum, and international law says we must accept asylum claims regardless of how they got here. Right now, the Border Patrol is accepting 2500 asylum claims a day, then returning any claims beyond that (with some exceptions).   But no, if you claim asylum you still have to go through a legal process to be granted asylum. A majority of asylum claims are rejected in court and they are deported. You aren't just ""left alone"".",ProLifePanda,2024-08-01T12:02:21,2
"Thanks for the overview. If the majority of 2500 asylum claims are rejected and they return home, then the claims on the right that several million are in the country are overblown. Is the migrant crisis in NYC caused by a different policy?",-_-_-0,2024-08-01T13:55:22,1
">If the majority of 2500 asylum claims are rejected and they return home, then the claims on the right that several million are in the country are overblown.  Well let's clarify here. The 2500 is what they catch and agree to process. There are obviously immigrants that get through without encounters, let alone arrest and deportations. The US Census Bureau estimates there are ~11 million unauthorized immigrants in the USA. Last year Border Patrol apprehended 2.5 MILLION illegal crossings.  >Is the migrant crisis in NYC caused by a different policy?  Part of the issue there is NYC passed a ""right to shelter"" law that guarantees each person a right to shelter. So if an illegal immigrant goes there, the city is obligated to provide them housing. When the immigrants come through the border, assuming they pass background checks, they are released within the US to await their court date. Many jurisdictions will provide you reasonable travel to a location of your choice. Many Venezuelans have friends/family in NYC, so they choose there. Additionally, some GOP states like Texas are shipping migrants there to intentionally strain Democratic cities and states to make immigration a hot button issue.",ProLifePanda,2024-08-01T14:08:47,1
"The number of undocumented immigrants has hovered around 10 million for decades, if the figures are correct. I've also been reading about Chinese asylum seekers (though migrating at a smaller scale) who start their trek from South America.   Now reading a piece from PBS, which may explain why crossings have been surging.   >   The government relied heavily on a public health tool called Title 42 to quickly eject people from the country. But there was no penalty so experts say migrants returned again and again, thus pushing up the statistics",-_-_-0,2024-08-01T15:39:28,1
