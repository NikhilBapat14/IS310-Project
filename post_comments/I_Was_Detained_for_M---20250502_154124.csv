"Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian human rights advocate who was detained by ICE for two weeks, writes in a guest essay for Times Opinion:  >By seeking to deport me, the Trump administration is sending a clear message: There is no room for dissent, free speech be damned. It seems willing to shield an extremist Israeli government from criticism at the expense of constitutional rights, all while suppressing the possibility of a peaceful future for both Palestinians and Israelis, a future free of trauma and fear.

"The idea that Israel is the most specialest boy on the playground and cannot be criticized in any way really, really needs to end. It is a foreign government (and one that receives billions of dollars in our money at that.) Nothing more, nothing less. We should be able to criticize it, up to and including saying that it shouldn’t exist. That’s what free speech *is*.",get-the-marshmallows,2025-05-02T16:03:17,25
"If you and the administration are that thin-skinned, feel free to yell as much as you want, as you are doing now. You have First Amendment rights just as he does.

"Did you miss Trump, a person fully able to take action, doubling down on the ""Gaza Riviera""?  Emptying the region?  I think that is in the realm of genocide, but is straight up ethnic cleansing.  Here we have a mouthpiece 'guest'.  I fully believe that speech has to be more greatly curtailed, and entitling myself to believe that necessitates consideration of the entire problem.  So if one is to be condemned for speech, there is little efficacy in cherry picking.",srandrews,2025-05-02T15:59:48,10

"ICE has failed to provide any evidence at all of their claims and all of their requests to allow them to deport or hold Mahdawi based on those unevidenced allegations have been refused by the courts.  It is utterly transparent that this detainment was purely political and a clear violation of his first amendment rights, and his right to due process.  The only anti-american rhetoric here is coming from you, the person trying to argue *against* the rights *guaranteed* to everyone in this country under the bill of rights.",HerbaciousTea,2025-05-02T16:01:29,25

"Are you still going to be saying this when Trump declares that all antifa activity is terrorist rhetoric? Or will you realize that ""terrorism"" is an arbitrary designation that authoritarian regimes frequently use as a catch-all category to quash dissent?  The pro-Israel playbook *is* the right-wing authoritarian playbook, at this point. There's a reason figures like Orban, Bolsonaro and Richard Spencer all see it as a model to follow! It's deeply sad that a state formed as a reaction to the horrors of the Nazi regime has done so much to lay the groundwork for modern fascism.   Oh, and let's not even get into how Israel was founded by literal terrorist groups (namely Irgun and Lehi), and elected members of those terrorist groups as PM, multiple times (Begin and Shamir, respectively). Or how one of the parties holding up Netanyahu's coalition is a thinly veiled rebranding of the Kach party, banned by Israel for terrorism and racism (even by their standards).     Whenever I see an Israeli official say ""we can't give the Palestinians a state, because we'd be rewarding terrorism"", it's very hard to suppress the compulsion to laugh hysterically. It's like... that's how it worked for you guys, and then you have the chutzpah to turn around and say ""hey, you can't do the things we did to get our state""? Have some self-awareness, please!    ...Sometimes I can't believe I have to share an ethnicity and religion with so many people who have a less developed theory of mind than the average toddler.",Professional-Sea4649,2025-05-02T22:05:39,6
