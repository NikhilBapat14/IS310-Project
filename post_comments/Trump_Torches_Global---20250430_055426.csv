"Trump hammered the “sick political class” before a crowd in Macomb County, Michigan.  “We’re taking back our country from a sick political class that got rich selling America out and bleeding America dry. We don’t let that happen anymore,” Trump said.  “After years of leaders who sent your money to defend the borders of distant foreign nations–that’s what we did; we’d fight for other nations, but not for ourself–you finally have a president who is defending our borders and our nation,” he went on to add.
