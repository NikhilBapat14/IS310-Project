">Trump issued his ban through [a Jan. 27 executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/prioritizing-military-excellence-and-readiness/), which said expressing a “false” gender identity “conflicts with a soldier’s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle” and “is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member.”  I'm wondering why the troops need to exhibit humility and selflessness but none of their executive branch leaders do.

"From Bloomberg News reporter [Greg Stohr](https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/ABoe0szR3_0/greg-stohr):  The US Supreme Court cleared the way for the Trump administration to start discharging thousands of transgender servicemembers, including people who have served openly for years.  Over three dissents, the justices dealt a major blow to LGBTQ rights, pausing a lower court order that had put President Donald Trump’s new ban on hold during a legal fight.",bloomberg,2025-05-06T13:09:46,50

"The far-right black-robed troglodyte supermajority’s evisceration of American women’s reproductive freedom 3 years ago next month was only the beginning.    Barring transgender Americans from voluntarily serving their country in uniform constitutes Republican LGBTQ-loathing bigotry at its foulest.   Today’s decision is wrapped in the same brand of preposterously rationalized judicial horseshit deployed to place women in politically red states at the mercy of Republican forced-birth fanatics who place more value on dead fetuses than saving the lives of women at death’s door from pregnancy complications.   Marriage equality, the Affordable Care Act, no-fault divorce, and who knows what else appear eminently on the chopping block, with Trump’s return to power ultimately thinning the ranks of lower-court judges  willing to block Trump’s hateful lunacies at the starting gate.",lotta_love,2025-05-06T14:15:10,13

"For those speculating: This ruling is not about the merits of the discharge of trans servicepeople. That question is still in litigation, and has not yet (i believe) reached the court of appeals. SCOTUS removed a trial-court level order which was preventing the government from implementing the discharge executive order while the case over the legality of the EO is pending.

"I want to remind everyone that when the Capitol Police and many other individuals within the Capitol were blockading the doors to hold off the insurrectionists, nobody was checking to make sure there weren't any trans people helping  them.   Especially with recruitment numbers being what they are, the military isn't even in a position up pick and choose based on biological sex. You accept what talent and strength you can.   It doesn't make any sense, either ethically or tactically, to decline offers of help from brave men and women who have demonstrated themselves to be in a position to protect their country and its citizens.  It's not even just a debate about religion or gender roles. Discriminating against trans soldiers doesn't make sense from a military standpoint. That's why so many officers in the military are wiling to embrace (or at least work with) trans soldiers even if said officers do still lean socially and/or fiscally conservative.

"Opus Dei is at play here. Trump’s “judge whisperer” Leonard Leo (of Heritage/Federalist Society/Teneo Network) who advised on his Supreme Court picks is a member, as is Kevin Roberts the Heritage president and while it’s not confirmed, certain Supreme Court justices are friends of OD. Allegedly Vance is too — the Trojan Horse they plan to ensconce after having Trump declared senile. DC’s Catholic Information Center is their hub. P25 coauthor/member Austen Rose’s articles for Crisis magazine are prescient with the King Trump and Pope images; he asks ""Can We Finally Go Back To Having Kings?” and wants a “Trumpian Pope” to replace Francis. Much of what Trump does and says is verbatim (for word salad) OD. What they have planned is diabolical, like suspending the Constitution after declaring a state of emergency, then declaring (Roman) Catholicism the official church with labor camps (or worse) and revoked citizenship for the heretics, outlawing LGBTQ+, only (Roman) Catholic men can vote etc. More grim details in link, especially the last contribution: [https://www.reddit.com/r/opusdeiexposed/comments/1js9bkh/opus\_dei\_and\_christian\_nationalism\_scorched\_earth/](https://www.reddit.com/r/opusdeiexposed/comments/1js9bkh/opus_dei_and_christian_nationalism_scorched_earth/)",Huge_Excitement4465,2025-05-06T20:38:20,1

"Depends on the sailor. Of the few Transgender sailors i personally know, only one is worth it. She works just as hard as any other person I know. But the other are a drain on the commands they work for. They came in without surgery and had genitals that didn't match thier gender and have decided they needed fixed as soon as reporting to their first command. After receiving close to a year of training before arriving to a 3 year billet, they will spend 2 of those years on medication, mental care and post surgery care away from the billet they were supposed to fill. During that time, their command doesn't get a replacement sailor, and the other sailors in their assigned work center have to pick up the load. Most work centers are not billeted for more than 5-6 people on some ships, which means sailors who are already overworked will have to pick up an additional 20% of the work. When the Transgender sailor returns to their command, they may have a year left to learn their job even though they should have years of knowledge already.

"I mean that's fine TBH. Military as a whole is only 1% of our population. And within that 1%, the medical and physical demands vary a bit.  It's a concern for national health, but not especially for military readiness. Every branch hit their recruitment goals the past few years, IIRC.  For those 23% eligible, I got a bit of info if you care. I get that there is obvious risk with enlistment or commissioning, but the military is perfectly adequate tool for social mobility. It gave me what I was unable to get for myself through university.  Professional job training. Experience in that field. Leadership experience.  If you retire, there is an actual pension that you can live off of (after 20 years).  Pretty much everyone serving gets a bit banged up from the rigorous training regimen. Getting roughed up can be physically painful, but at least if you get properly hurt, they pay you for the rest fo your life.

"This is something I know a lot about and can explain. The military implemented a new medical system called MHS Genesis a few years ago.

It used to be before that when you were enlisting you would just lie about all of your previous illnesses, or anything you once took medication for and quit. Genesis sees everything. People who were qualified before are now being turned away until they complete a waiver process. Often this process is a big deterrent and a pain in the ass if you have a bad recruiter who doesn’t care because they hate their job. In the short term it lowers recruitment numbers but saves money in the long run because people won’t unexpectedly develop problems years down the line.   The big recruitment slump happened right after Genesis was implemented. The DoD didn’t want to acknowledge that as the reason why because they just spent a fuck ton of money rolling it out. Instead what they did was lower the standards to allowing high school dropouts and made fat camps for overweight trainees. People like Trump quickly latched onto this, saying it was because of “wokeness”.

">And you're talking about lethality and yet surely you recognize that both women and trans men are, on average, weaker than males?  Physical strength is irrelevant to lethality for most folks in the military because most jobs aren't combat arms, especially most folks you're likely to find trans people in which are going to tend to be technology or intelligence disciplines.  Are cooks going to have to fight sometimes? Hopefully not, but there's a reason everyone gets trained in basic combat. Even when they do, it's probably going to be with firearms rather than brute strength. Their single biggest impact to lethality is making sure the folks who primarily do the fighting are kept fed and ready to go.   Regardless, the *average* physical strength *is completely irrelevant*.  There is ONLY 1 relevant question: Can the service member do their job? That's it, full stop.  >Like I said, dependence on pharmaceuticals is the same reason that diabetics cannot serve.  No it isn't. There's more to it. A lot more. False comparison.

Transgender people exist before enlistment or during and can probably feel a sense of unease and act on it later when they use benefits available. There is no test to determine if someone is transgender or not before enlisting.   Here is a fun riddle. If you train a navy pilot; that’s a ton of money and effort. A few million dollars. That pilot comes out later as transgender and the science says no harm really here after some evaluation and time. Do you scrap that pilot ? That’s an expensive investment otherwise. You make a case by case decision here if you are responsible for the pilots performance in combat etc.,wrath224,2025-05-06T23:00:27,1
