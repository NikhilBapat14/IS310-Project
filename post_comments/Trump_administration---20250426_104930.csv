Itâ€™s the waking up each and every day and wondering what changes are still valid and what has been withdrawn. Who is flavour of the day today,Maleficent_Pay_4154,2025-04-26T16:32:26,2

"Sadly this doesnt restore the status of deported students.  It just forced ICE to restore thousands of SEVIS records (""Student and Exchange Visitor Information System""), bY COURT ORDER.  Apparently being 'SEVIS-less' is a murky legal status because - even though having a SEVIS record is a pre-req to obtaining a student Visa, and is maintained for reporting purposes - a student's Visa is still ""valid"" even if the SEVIS record 'disappears'... although ... not in any pristine sense  Suffice it to say, ICE was ""messing with"" visiting student's records, and the court forced them to STOP and restore the records they had deleted.  ICE are worse law-breakers and felons than any student they've deported - the courts are having to CONSTANTLY keep them in check.",XSinTrick6666,2025-04-26T12:48:42,3
"That implies that people with brains will decide to subject themselves to flip flop of an authoritarian regime supported by a very sizable xenophobic political portion of country.     Validity of Visa makes it possible for brains to come and contribute in society. Society giving poplar vote to anti-immigration nutcase is a greater disease, not unseen by brains with self-respect and common sense.",Unhappy_Sugar_5091,2025-04-26T12:49:43,2
