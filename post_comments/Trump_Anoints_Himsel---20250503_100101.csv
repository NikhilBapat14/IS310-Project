Trump is not a confirmed Catholic and has no business commenting in this capacity (Confirmation is a sacrement and the equivalent of a Bar Mitzvah, not we're speculating on his religion.

Mine was a 3 year long program where I literally read the entire Bible. That is, however, on the extreme end for preparation).
