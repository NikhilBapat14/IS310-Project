"The African people is extremely divided culturally and, unlike the EU where many of its members are in good relations, there are many much more drastic conflicts in Africa   Likewise Africa isn’t a prosperous place to start with and has more stuff to worry about instead of starting its own currency: war, humanitarian and economic crisis, massive shortages, just to name a few…  Impossible? No, nothing is impossible. Highly unlikely?  Yes, it might be a thing in the distant future, but for now…",ReallyMaxyy,2022-12-26T07:36:11,5
"Unlikely. The AU isn’t a monolith or even a common market like the EU nor is it really intended to be. Many francophone countries in Africa are tied to France’s currency and its financial system; they’re unlikely to get out of that arrangement for a common currency, nor would France make it easy. Additionally for there to be a common currency the AU would have to agree on who runs currency policy and where the printing should be. It is not clear there’s anywhere in the AU that every country would agree on should have the outsized role in monetary policy that Germany, for example, has in the EU.  Furthermore, there are probably too many wildly different economies with different levels of investment ratings in the AU for it to be in anyone’s interest to form a common currency. The EU struggles with this given the difference in economic policies of central vs southern European countries. Africa presents exponentially more differences; an economy like Ghana doesn’t want its economic fortune tied to South Sudan. But if they had a common currency, Ghana would maybe bear the cost of any stimulus provided to South Susan to dig it out of economic depression. That’s the sort of unruly dynamic that would put AU countries off the idea.",dunpyklungo,2022-12-26T11:58:24,2
Most of Africa is considered Economically Unfree or Repressed. Until the African continent is mostly stable representative Democracies they should not even consider a union much less their own currency.,StedeBonnet1,2022-12-28T06:24:29,1

"I'm a bit late here but there in East Africa there are clearly defined and politically supported efforts to do this - and in fact towards an East African Confederation and eventually even an East African Federation.   The East African Community has already developed a (bit of a disaggregated) customs union for the free movement of goods and labour among member states, though implementation isn't exactly even across all member states. That's expected to become more easily implemented with the introduction of new generation EAC ID cards (which actually will identify people as both citizens of their country as well as East African citizens - similar to the 'dual' status of European Union citizens as having rights as both their home country's citizens and EU citizens).   And that customs union has been directly stated to be a precursor for a shared common currency.   How quickly this can happen is another question - obviously there are concerns that raised alarm given the euro crisis about a decade ago - when a lot of the strongest work on an East Africa Federation was happening. The member states of the EAC are all committed to greater integration but they're also at pretty vastly different levels of economic stability, growth, and political stability. A common currency without greater levels of political integration to help manage monetary and fiscal policy is difficult - as the euro crisis demonstrated. That's a big hurdle to overcome, even though the political will seems to be there.",PhiloPhocion,2022-12-30T06:44:26,1
