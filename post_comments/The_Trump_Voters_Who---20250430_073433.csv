"""Even if they don’t agree with everything he’s doing, he’s doing something.”  The bar can't get much lower than ""he's doing something.""",30mil,2025-04-30T07:38:15,34
These are basically zero-information voters who have no idea what’s happening around them. It’s a sad situation.,ranchoparksteve,2025-04-30T07:41:58,21
"My family and I never discuss politics, they all have their Republican beliefs and they know that I don't agree with them so we just leave it alone. About a month ago, I became a pariah because I said that the Gulf of America thing was stupid. Since then, they absolutely refuse to speak to me because I spoke out against Trump.   To say that his supporters ""like what they see"" is a complete understatement, they are so absolutely bought in that they are willing to go to complete extremes in support of him. If he declared MAGA a terrorist organization tomorrow these people would line up to get into the labor camps.",SharpNSlick,2025-04-30T08:09:53,16
He makes them feel powerful.  The people they hate are miserable.   He is delivering exactly what they wanted... vengeance and misery.     They dont want their lives to be better... they want to feel better.,jsreyn,2025-04-30T07:44:51,14

"I get that we’re drawn to these kinds of articles to try make sense of things but these people have always been around they just haven’t had their man in power.   These are descendants, literal or not, of the Daughters of the American Revolution, the Confederacy, the Nazis, the KKK, etc.   The problem isn’t that these people exist, it’s that they have outsized power, follow by a Congress that’s capitulating to them.",loud-oranges,2025-04-30T08:19:51,9

It is worth repeating that most Trump supporters are fine with Trump causing a global recession if it means keeping the USA a majority white country longer.,vpniceguys,2025-04-30T09:32:14,6

"One of the typical features of fascism as described by Umberto Eco: The cult of action for action’s sake.  >“Action being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation.”",dietTAB,2025-04-30T07:55:35,25

"I get they are cultists, but people in general - not just MAGAs - want action from politicians, hopefully for the better but even just for action's sake. What is one of the largest complaints you see about the Democratic party from members? They aren't doing enough. AOC, Bernie, Pritzker, Hogg, and a few others are getting positive press precisely because they are out there. If I see one more comment that says ""The Dems aren't in power in any branch so WhAt Do YoU wAnT tHeM tO dO?"" I'll scream. Something. Anything. Just move.",Cdub7791,2025-04-30T12:11:42,0
I would argue some of them have been experiencing a form of religious mania for the past decade. This has definitely passed the threshold for a diagnosable mental health condition at this point.,Acrobatic_Hamster686,2025-04-30T07:58:05,10
"they will all say that Biden did nothing for 4 years, and they aren't wrong, but they are clueless about how for the better part of Biden's presidency Mike Johnson was hard at work making sure nothing got done while giving major committee assignments to Marjorie Greene who was once found sitting on the floor yelling at a mail slot.",ehunke,2025-04-30T07:54:52,4
Same here. I lost a friend early on 1st term due to this.   My 80 year old mother lost all her childhood friends because they ostracized her for speaking out against their Orange Emperor.,Life_Commission3765,2025-04-30T08:12:04,7

"This is my first experience with it, it is blowing my mind a bit, I had no idea that they were all so bought in. But, here we are, a family at odds over some orange asshole that wouldn't piss on any of us if we were on fire.",SharpNSlick,2025-04-30T08:25:48,3
"It makes sense though, critical thinking is anathema to Trumpism and the MAGA cult. The problem for them is that you can't sustain a social movement on ignorance and thoughtlessness, the foundation is inherently unstable.",dietTAB,2025-04-30T09:10:01,3
These people have always been like this. Traitor don has exposed it. He was allowed to spread lies and hate along with fox news and right wing social media.,Other-Net-3262,2025-04-30T08:58:45,1
"I mean this brand of Conservatives have been going strong since Reagan, or arguably before. You can sustain the movement so long as you have a couple shepherds leading the sheep.",DartLeingod,2025-04-30T09:23:45,2
"True, they've postured and pretended for years, putting on airs about patriotism, American exceptionalism, etc. But the self-mythologizing is merely a shell, and that shell is hollowed out and becoming brittle and untenable. This spray-tanned ignoramus is the culmination, and I can scarcely see how they'll maintain the air of legitimacy after their actions and policies inevitably give way to the atrocities that lie ahead of us.  Their 50+ year plan for domination is coming to a head, and they have an inept, error-prone, and fraudulent carnival huckster running the show. You can fool some of the people all of the time, all of the people some of the time, but you can't fool all of the people all of the time.",dietTAB,2025-04-30T09:32:03,2
