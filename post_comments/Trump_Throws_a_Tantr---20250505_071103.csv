"They kept saying ""Democrats literally HATE AMERICA! They want the terrorists to WIN!"" to win elections, and then once they were in office they ran up the deficit and gave money to their rich friends.   You can only do that so many times. Your voters wait and wait for you to destroy the evil Democrats who are ruining America, but it never happens. Just tax cuts and deregulation.    After a while, you get true believers like MTG and Jim Jordan in office, who don't get the act.
