"Probably?   Objectively speaking, you can list the top teachings of Christ and document trump then doing the opposite.  It’s one thing to watch a dictator rise to power, but the fact that members of a mainstream religion support him? Boggles my mind.   Do you know when America was great? When a politician lost any chance of getting elected because it was found out they were cheating on their spouse.  When we actually held politicians to a higher standard than the average citizen. We expected them to be more intelligent, and of higher moral character.   Now, it’s OK to elect an actual felon into the White House. He literally cannot legally vote in an election, but he can be voted into office. The world has gone mad. Welcome to our dystopian future.",joetaxpayer,2025-04-21T08:13:28,140

"Well, the P is for ....  But I suppose it is where we are talking about.  Old school preppy New England WASPs were more or less Anglican, Episcopalian, or some other derivative of the Church of England.  The only other group of people that I am aware of who referred to themselves as WASPs were more or less upper-middle class, white, Conservatives, as the name denotes a bit of money and social influence.  Protestants are those who broke away from the Catholic Church back in the day, including the Church of England.  But, although the Church of England broke from the Catholic Church it still retained a good chunk of stuff from Catholicism, so a little of both.
