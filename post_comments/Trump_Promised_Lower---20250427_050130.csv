They are currently up about 3.0% generally year over year, and are predicted by the USDA to increase by 3.5% in 2025.

"It's not about Trump alone, it's a reflection on how absolutely unhinged and disconnected 1/4 of the country is from reality, and how isolated, privileged, self-centered and disconnected from community another other 1/3 is.  It's cultural. America has always had problems, but we're accelerating those issues as economic mobility declines, and we've not yet learned that working together is the best path to solving it. Instead, the billionaires are using their media channels, algorithms, and propaganda institutions to teach people that doing the opposite is the way to go.  We 'might' learn from this mistake, and there are legit sings of major backlash as Trump's promises totally fail, but given the gravity and seriousness of the situation, despite his approval hitting record lows at record speed, it's still not fast enough.  Congress must remove him and Vance both from power, and get people like Elon as far from US politics and government functions as possible, but we know it's going to take a depression level threat or even event for that to even become remotely possible.  And even if they do? The rest of the psychopaths in his admin are still waiting to step up and fill the void, possibly with better sounding lies and sound bites that may or may not work.  The only way to truly fix this was to have convinced people who didn't vote that they were wrong, and make sure they never live it down and never make the same mistakes. They can complain about ""insert dem policy"" ""messaging"" and ""Nancy Pelosi's stocks"" all they like, sometimes with merit even (She shouldn't be profiting off stocks, bluntly put), but they don't show up for primaries or local elections either, so all the non-voters who complain effectively have shown they have 0 interest in having basic rights, and now we all pay the price for their ignorance.",NumeralJoker,2025-04-27T13:51:52,4
