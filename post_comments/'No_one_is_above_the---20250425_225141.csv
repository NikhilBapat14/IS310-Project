No. But it HAD been used previously. Ruiz was apprehended shortly after outside of court - as was appropriate.   This is NOTHING more than ICE and the Trump administration going after a judge for not bending over backwards to support the new regime's gestapo.

[the Supreme Court has affirmed that 4 seperate times over 107 years](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S8-C18-8-7-2/ALDE_00001262/)  It is well outside the norm for someone in a courtroom to be deported on an immigration detainer, while on trial for a violent crime. Generally the US wants to punish criminals, not just give them a get out of jail free card. 70 years of sucessful deportations have occured by arresting someone AFTER their trial, a constitutional right for all people in the US. It gives their victims justice, it gives the government justice, it reassures American citizens that our system works.   This is once again an attack on the US Constitution. I get yall are EXTREMELY short sighted, but it is not a good precedent to set that the government can literally strip your rights under the 4th and 15th Amendements without due process.
