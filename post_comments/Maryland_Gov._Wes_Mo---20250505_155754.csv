Absolutely. Pride in separation of church and state. What a great fucking idea! Pride in due process. Nobody’s free unless everybody is! Pride in Seperation of Powers. Pride in the historical independence of the DOJ. I could keep going but this is what we run on.,TheSouthsideSlacker,2025-05-05T16:13:01,10
"[Maryland Gov. Wes Moore](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/05/politics/wes-moore-democrats-trump?utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit) appears to be everywhere at the moment — popping up on “The View,” delivering a commencement address at a historically Black university in battleground Pennsylvania and, later this month, delivering an address to South Carolina Democrats, who could be pivotal in determining the Democratic Party’s nominee in 2028.  The rising star is part of a chorus of Democratic leaders putting forward a vision for how the party should take on Donald Trump as the president plows ahead with his second-term agenda.  “We need to be a country that really gets to know each other again and works together and serves together,” Moore told CNN in an interview following his Sunday commencement address at Lincoln University, where he emphasized bringing Americans from different political ideologies together through a shared commitment to service.  That cheerful outlook comes at a time of deep dissatisfaction among Democrats with the state of the party’s leadership and approach to countering Trump. A [recent CNN poll](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/29/politics/poll-frustration-anger-politics?utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit) found that just 38% of Democratic-aligned Americans approve of their party’s leadership, compared with 61% who say they disapprove.",cnn,2025-05-05T15:59:02,2
"The Ds are too splintered to come up with a compelling vision for the country, much less effectively resist the Orange Calf. The fact that they don't even have a universally agreed on autopsy of the 2024 election shows how much work they need to do.   In the meantime, the media will be like grasshoppers leaping at any D with a pulse to proclaim as the next potential D leader. Pathetic.",Greedy_Switch_6991,2025-05-05T16:47:56,3

"While I agree with the message, I also have to be aware that he’s being pushed on us as a potential corporate democrat for ‘28. So, same stuff we’ve been used to.",BigDaddyBain,2025-05-05T17:47:02,1
"Just watched an interview of him on the Breakfast club last week and was genuinely impressed. I think he may be a solid candidate in 28 if he stays on the path he’s on right now. Solid record, good on crime so they can’t pull that card and extremely well spoken.",_TheLonelyStoner,2025-05-05T16:10:22,0
"Hey Moore, remember Maryland? You know, the state that you're governor of? The state that is going to feel the highest heat of Trump's 2025 targeting?  Yeah. Focus on that for a while.",CockBrother,2025-05-05T16:30:18,0
"Dems need to first make it clear that the vision Republicans assign to them is not correct.  For example, Rs think Ds have no real interest in deporting immigrants here illegally and instead want to find them a pathway to citizenship.  It's a blanket thing meaning to Rs there's no discerning between a convicted murderer and someone who busts ass at a low level job to provide for themselves and their family.  Dems could easily step in and say 'We support the removal of immigrants here illegally who are guilty of (any felony or a violent crime or whatever caveat they want) but seek a pathway to citizenship for those who are demonstrably productive and contributing to society.'",yrotsihfoedisgnorw,2025-05-05T17:06:55,-1

"This just sounds like the same bullshit platitudes the democrats always trot out. “We need to work together as a country toward our shared goals.” This is why they get lapped by the republicans at every turn. They lost the Supreme Court for a generation, Roe V Wade with it, and two elections against the worst candidate the republicans have ever put forward all with the exact same rhetoric. Who knows what else we stand to lose when this is all said and done.   And it’s not that there is anything wrong with that sentiment. Of course we will have to work together. Of course we have shared goals of seeing our country prosper (even if we disagree about how to do that). The problem is using that feel good bullshit when the other party is so willing to fight dirty. This is a dogfight and the democrats just simply can’t accept that.",HenryDorsettCase47,2025-05-05T17:07:39,7
