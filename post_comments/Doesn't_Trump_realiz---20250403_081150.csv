"A decrease in the dollar is not necessarily a bad thing.  Countries purposely devalue their currency all the time in order to make exports more competitive and spur domestic production.  Sometimes the dollar falls when the Fed lowers interest rates and bonds go down.  Lower interest rates spur the economy.  Conversely higher rates can cool it off and lower inflation, and the dollar goes up usually.  This time however it doesn't seem planned.  It is a symptom of the disarray caused by a powerful but demented leader.   The markets have no idea what is coming next, the tariffs change day to day, he says stupid things all the time.  So businesses are circling the wagons and not investing just consolidating their liquid capital.  The money supply is shrinking so the economy will contract.  Apparently 80% of the voters who listed the economy as their major concern in the last election voted for the man with an abysmal track record of bankruptcies.

"Yes, again, read. This is the point. Trump has been given the task of isolating America to end American hegemony. We cannot fight direct wars with Russia and China. Our role as privileged leader of the world is due to our ability to inflict physical and economic violence upon opponents. Since we cannot physically fight Russia and China due to mutually assured destruction  - we use sanctions, trade, and most importantly, the US Dollar to impose our will via NGOs and other methods upon our enemies. China and Russia want to dislodge the US Dollar as the world currency so that they can pursue their regional and global influence by empowering BRICS as an alternative to US financial and soft power. With us out of the leadership role there will be a power vacuum which China and Russua will fill as we can no longer inflict economic harm upon them in a meaningful way.

"This is about power and ownership. ¬†  The 1% have been acquiring ownership of property, capital, and real estate at a frightening pace since Covid... they were already on a record pace before Covid. ¬†We're way past the inequality of the Depression era now.¬†  The 5% and 10% rich people have realized that there's no more room at the top. They're getting squeezed. They're being skipped over as the wealth transfer from the Boomers goes straight to the 1% and mega corporations. ¬†  That's why they're doubling down on libertarianism and religion. ¬†They can stop the 1% but they can make their own little feudal states where the 1% have to negotiate with them to run things. ¬†",mabhatter,2025-04-04T08:31:51,1

"I have always felt that ""weaker"" and ""stronger"" are misleading for a currency. Better to say ""cheaper"" or ""more expensive"".

"I honestly don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs Russian plant. I think he thinks he‚Äôs making himself ‚ÄúEmperor of the Earth‚Äù by forcing every country on the planet to come to him to negotiate with him exclusively to end the tariffs, and therefore is able to not only dictate US policy, but also get other countries to bend to his will. I think that‚Äôs all there is to it.   Of course, Project 2025, Vaught, Yarvin, and the other techbro fascists have different plans wherein crashing the economy is a key component, but they‚Äôre not POTUS, Trump is, and everything Trump has done and said seems to indicate that he genuinely believes that he can control other countries.",zedazeni,2025-04-03T10:59:12,2

I am convinced of this. In the 80s he spent a lot of time in Russia. I‚Äôm pretty sure the NKVD or KGB or whatever they‚Äôve got going now have something on him.  There‚Äôs a P tape or something else that they have on him and he has just gotten himself into a position to help the Russians out. I am thoroughly convinced of this.

He gets to feel like the most important person ever when people are falling over themselves to talk to him, foreign leaders give him a token concession (often that doesn't actually change any policy), and the tariffs go away.   Trump gets to think he's the greatest negotiator ever, Republicans talk about how other countries are bowing to America and respect us again, and everyone else sees that this just further erodes trust in America and makes our allies and trading partners look elsewhere.",ThrowACephalopod,2025-04-03T09:13:27,27
