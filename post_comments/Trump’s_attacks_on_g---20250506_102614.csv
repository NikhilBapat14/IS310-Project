True. Now the data centers will be begging state and local governments for even more sweet heart deals. Claiming there will be good jobs while just employing a handful of people.,Enviro_56,2025-05-06T10:33:47,2
"tRump is a complete moron when it come to just about anything... Wind farms are a great source of energy. And no, they don't kill 1,000's of birds nor kill whales. trump is completely clueless when it comes to any sort of tech. He wants coal to come back, for some unknown reason. Sorry, but coal is dead. They have already removed a lot of coal generation plants and they wont build more. Some are being replaced by NG power plants.",Harry_Mud,2025-05-06T10:37:05,2

"Chump, and his regime are clueless.  I do want to say that the Aududon Society does say that Wind farms harm birds.  However, the bird deaths are the same as how many birds sky scrapers kill every year.  I don't see Chump knocking down his buildings to save birds.    They do say that if the windmills were Purple or were designed different that would mitigate bird strikes.  Chump's Regime doesn't want to innovate, they just want to destroy.",OtpyrcLvl1,2025-05-06T12:48:11,2

"Nope, no US towns will allow a nuclear reactor built anywhere close to it. No matter how many people say they want more nuclear power. No one wants to live anywhere close to a plant. Nothing against nuclear power people are just afraid of it or see it as an eye sore. You can tell them( with proof)  that nuclear is the safest option on the planet, and you won't convince people of that.",Classicman269,2025-05-06T10:41:58,5
So many small companies are doing this now.,timeflieswhen,2025-05-06T10:40:43,1
No. NG is replacing some of the coal plants. Wind power is a great source of power...... Nuke shit is dangerous and the waste from it takes 10's of 1000's of years to become safe. I don't want nuclear waste in my backyard.,Harry_Mud,2025-05-06T10:40:18,2
"Nuclear is not the long term answer. Yes it's ""clean"" but all of the water gets radioactive, and needs to be cold.  Right now nuclear reactors are having issues with water being too hot.  Wind, solar, geothermal are all good options",OtpyrcLvl1,2025-05-06T12:37:42,-1
"Depends on ""which part of town"". Red states offer temporary lifting of standards on new energy production if its an ""emergency"" (see the story about Elon's AI plant in Tennessee). And if that area is a ""red lined"" district (like that one in Tenn)... Even easier.",williamgman,2025-05-06T11:06:17,1
I know it can be forced. The issue is how to make it more accepted. This is probably the biggest problem. Both Democrats and Republicans instead of talking to rural constituents they just force it onto them. The GOP is really bad about this. The Dems never show up and like to ignore talking about rural problems. The democrats would have more rural support if they just showed up and held town halls. Let alone put money into races to run candidates. I was a rural voter now in a small city. The amount of unopposed races from GOP candidates that have been in that office of 30-plus years is insane. Most of us want new choices but don't get it. I know a large number of people who don't even bother voting in those races just leaving it unfilled out on the ballot.   Sorry of the rant that just struck a cord.,Classicman269,2025-05-06T11:19:37,1
