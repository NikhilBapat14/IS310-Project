"Just the idea that you can defend some civil rights, targeting something such as antisemitism, while ignoring other civil rights is the chef's kiss of ignorance and lack of self-awareness.",Lomak_is_watching,2025-05-03T07:21:28,4

A lot of very big think tanks and PACs and media programs conspired to do deprive certain people of their rights for years and now they're in the midst of this and what they're doing is on-going and the outcomes and ramifications of the effects of their original plans and their executions haven't completed yet and are very much do on-going.,postsshortcomments,2025-05-03T03:45:48,1

"They aren't defending jewish people. They are using them to undermine civil rights for everyone. Look what they did with Asians in affirmative action, they used them to basically make it illegal arguing blacks and Hispanics were taking spots away from whites and Asians.   A year later, the only group that benefits is whites. Asians are seeinf a smaller amount of students in colleges",Aggravating_Rise_179,2025-05-03T10:36:52,6

"Fuck off, there was a lot of voter suppression going on. A lot of mail in votes were not counted, there were intimidators around the polls, and the process of voting was intentionally made really slow so that long ass lines would form, and people who showed up after a certain hour were turned away, no new people were allowed to join the line. People who were already in line to vote were expected to stay in line and if they left line for whatever reason, they were not allowed back in.  I’m so fucking sick of this argument. I’m almsot convinced it started out as AI bot propaganda slop and now you guys just parrot it.",GlossyGecko,2025-05-03T19:06:52,2
"That's my point. Claiming to defend one group's civil rights, while simultaneously saying you'll not defend the civil rights of others is the lack of self awareness that is maddening!",Lomak_is_watching,2025-05-03T10:59:17,4
