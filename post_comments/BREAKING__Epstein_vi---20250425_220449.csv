"It is my hope and prayer that there is a special place in hell for all the people who have been involved in Epstein's evil, and have done so much to cover their tracks.   You can run on for a long time, sooner or later God'll cut you down.",TheIncredibleHork,2025-04-25T23:07:33,368

">‚ÄòShe lost her life to suicide, after being a lifelong victim of sexual abuse and sex trafficking.'  Maybe its just me but the ""she lost herself to suicide"" statememt feels too in your face for an anouncement like this",LastManSleeping,2025-04-25T23:57:48,135

"May this young woman RIP. She has been through hell and back, along with being embroiled in a messy divorce and losing custody of her children took it's toll on her. Lots of speculation around her death though.",martel197,2025-04-26T07:16:05,17

"Juicy conspiracy theory.  But there's so many lies coming out of her mouth, it's hard to actually invest in it.  Take the bus accident: There were like 30 kids on the bus at the time, a police report, and photo evidence of actual damage done to the car. Claiming she got hit at 110km is absurd.",Critical_Concert_689,2025-04-26T01:54:11,-64

"It's disgusting that the media will look right past this. A woman, with definitive proof of Prince Andrew sexually abusing her, tells her therapist and GP she's not suicidal and ends up dead.    I don't commonly subscribe to conspiracy theories but common, no one is going to look into this?",culman13,2025-04-25T22:49:48,541
It will never happen under Trump. Epstein got killed under him and now this. Meanwhile Trump appointed the prosecutor who offered Epstein immunity and a sweat deal to his cabinet. It's a big club and we're not in it.,JonSnowAzorAhai,2025-04-26T06:19:29,380

"""I am making it publicy known that in no way, shape or form am I sucidal.

I just checked your post history and you've posted over 30 new threads here in the past 5 days with only 2 or 3 getting removed.  Quit bitching you cry baby.,MeLlamoKilo,2025-04-26T05:42:23,55

That's the wrong post you're reading. The post from 2019 is an update to the story. If you scroll down in the article you find another thing she posted on Instagram i think on March 31st where she says she has 4 days to live due to kidney failure.,DannyDootch,2025-04-26T04:41:54,50
