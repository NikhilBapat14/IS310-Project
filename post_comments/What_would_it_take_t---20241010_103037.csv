"The structure of the federal government is in the constitution, so minimally, you would need an amendment that comprehensively defines a parliamentary system and repeals a lot of the articles. For such a massive structural change, you'd probably want a full constitutional convention that just writes a new constitution, though.   It would be politically impossible to get this done in the current status quo imo.",_vercingtorix_,2024-10-11T08:32:25,11
"The main obstacle for this to happen is that our Constitution specifically creates a presidential, not parliamentary, system. So it really doesn't matter what any candidates propose, until we are willing to throw out or drastically amend the Constitution, this cannot happen. For a structural change of this magnitude, we would need a specific intention to embrace structural change. But how would we get to the point where we were willing to basically scrap the Constitution entirely?  The idea that we'd need a third party with overwhelming consensus support is...not accurate. For one thing, that's not even possible to reach in any realistic scenario. For another, the difference between 65% support and 80% isn't all that significant, and one of the two main parties supporting something is just as ""real"" as a third party doing it. If I had to guess, I'm assuming your emphasis on third parties is built off an assumption that the two primary parties wouldn't support significant change. This is a common misconception.  For one thing, all the major adjustments to the Constitution have come directly from the established political parties, not some mysterious outside force that changes everything. Second, we've seen in systems across the world that the establishment powers WILL support change in certain circumstances. Hell, the primary example of parliamentary systems, the UK, saw hugely significant reforms from within the establishment powers, beginning with the Magna Carta and continuing into traditions like the Brown Laws and the Corn Laws. The House of Lords was reformed out of having actual major power primarily because a sitting House of Lords member insisted on it!  The idea that change means the sitting officials have a lot to lose is just incorrect. Meaningful reforms that demonstrably improve the government's performance AND make the electorate happier are a massive improvement for sitting elected officials. That would be a situation where they have a lot to GAIN, which is why we've seen officials do stuff like this many times in history.  If you want reform, the best thing to do is to support reform and try to get others to support it as well. Who cares what party ends up going along with you. If it's a third party, fine, but in the US all the third parties are just grifting organizations. You'd be way more successful pushing for meaningful reform within a party committed to responsible governing already, like the Dems. There's a reason the Dems have been successfully driving changes to primaries and voting rules all around the country and the Greens/Libs/etc are just going on podcasts driving the same old political narratives that they always have.",mormagils,2024-10-11T12:04:31,3
A lot of smart people tried to outplay Jefferson on the Constitution.   He has never lost.  He designed it to ensure people like you (parliamentarians) never control the country.,Harleyman555,2024-10-13T16:08:11,2
"What distinguishes a parliamentary democracy from the US presidential system is that the US president is both the head of state and head of government, versus a parliamentary system in which the head of government is in the lower house.  The US could change this informally if it chose to.  The president could decide to act in a non-partisan fashion, opting to exercise less power by confining the presidential role to appointments, foreign policy and a lightly used veto.  The house speaker as prime minister would take on more authority, while the senate could choose to serve more in an advise and consent role to both the president and House.  Of course, none of this will actually happen.  But it could happen if elected officials chose to respect the new rules.  (OK, good luck with that.)",I405CA,2024-10-22T02:02:08,2

The same as for any other major constitutional change.  75% of the state legislatures.  If your 80% of the population are in the wrong place to achieve the majority the only options are the threat of revolution and secession.,Tetracropolis,2024-10-13T11:27:32,1
"It would be politically impossible to get this done ever. Never in the past, and I can't imagine a future with it either. The American system is just plain superior, or at least so many of us have always thought so that the difficulty of making such a change is political suicide for any single candidate, let alone for the number of candidates in all of the different legislatures that it would take.",NoTable2313,2024-10-13T00:18:41,5
A regular amendment wonâ€™t work anyway because Article V requires effectively the unanimous consent of the state legislatures to change equal votes by state in the Senate.,whip_lash_2,2024-10-23T12:28:52,2
Jefferson? He was in France when the constitution was being created. Do you perhaps mean Madison?,davise34,2025-03-16T00:15:16,1
"> Never in the past  I'd say the swap from the Articles over to the Constitution is similarly radical, but yeah more or less this is something that would be impossible nowadays.",_vercingtorix_,2024-10-13T16:21:24,1
"The American presidential system is not superior to the parliamentary system. In general, presidential democracies have had a shorter lifespan than parliamentary democracy with proportional representation.  They fail more often when the president declares martial law in an emergency, gets rid of the free press,  packs the supreme court with loyal cronies, imprisons those who object, changes the constitution to allow him to run as many times as he wants, and then just rigs elections thereafter.  Norway, which has been a democracy for 210 years, has a parliamentary system. I not sure why the USA has lasted this long, but I think the popular conviction that America is special, ""ordained by God""  and the protection of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and our generally good economic situation has much to do with it.",BornSession6204,2025-03-05T09:23:09,1
"The equal representation in the Senate may not be changed, but we've already changed the manner in which senators are chosen once. In Canada the senators are appointed, formerly for life but now with a mandatory retirement age.",Fluid_Board_3937,2024-11-08T20:48:37,1
