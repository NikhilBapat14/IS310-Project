There's no reason to boycott only target, yet if you go to the anticonsumption subreddit, that's all they seem to care about. It should be a boycott focused on all major retailers, especially amazon and walmart.    Basically, democrats are giant hypocrites when it comes to consuming.

"Possibly.  I do a lot of research into EV's, so I think of myself as well informed, and from what I've gathered, China has definitely got the best battery tech right now. However, Chinese EV's still aren't profitable yet. Teslas do turn a profit on their EV's.   Once China can get the cost down, they will be better than Tesla in almost every respect.  The research and development of batteries takes a while to put technological improvements into mass production.  So Tesla has to play catch up in the R&D realm, but the real question is if they have enough of a head start with their economies of scale to catch up with their Chinese competitors.  Teslas are definitely America's best EV's, but I wholely agree with boycotting them. American sold competitors aren't super far behind, but the momentum Teslas had really forced other car company's hand to invest in EVs.  I'm not mad that Tesla is hurting, but if they actually did die, I think the American companies ramping up their EV portfolios might die too. And that domino effect would suck.  American maker EV's face big hurdles from this administration.

"None of these improvements matter. Tesla's future has nothing to do with  technology or the pace of their R&D.  Plenty of us Tesla owners loved the cars and the brand and were customers for life. And plenty of us aren't that price sensitive and don't care much about battery improvements. I didn't need anything in terms of improvements personally.   The real issue is that we can't buy Teslas anymore. We were about to buy our next one. Even if somehow they convinced me through some amazing discount, they would never again convince my wife to agree to another Tesla even if they offered them for free!  Legacy auto makers can't kill EVs because of the rest of the world.  It doesn't matter what the US administration does, the EU won't follow. In a decade US auto makers will be locked out of foreign markets if they don't offer EVs. That would be devastating and eventually kill them.  And I don't think they want to get rid of EVs. One of their biggest problems in the US is labor costs, and EVs are the solution to that. Also, many companies have severely curtailed their combustion engine research and laid many people off. That pipeline would be hard to restart.",light_hue_1,2025-04-23T07:17:49,1
"The American public has shown to be, on average, quite the chicken shit bitches by the way they fall for the Republican fear tactics.  So I think a few reports of accidents in their full self driving taxis will harm tesla bc it will scare anyone willing to give money to Tesla away.  And that's one of the very few times I think republicans would react rationally due to their fears.  Also, those Tesla self driving taxis are launching in deep blue cities. At this point, those people are genuinely so pissed that the taxis are going to be a failure even if the technology is perfect. And Tesla can't send the taxis to Republican areas bc those areas aren't dense enough to turn a profit.   So I don't see the taxi business going well no matter how good it is.  Musk really set a huge aspirational goal up for complete failure no matter how they play it at this point.  And his exhibited stupidity is exactly why I don't think billionaires are ever geniuses. They might have a lot of knowledge in one very niche area, but they will never be a good choice in anything other than that one very niche area.

"The carbon credits do help, but they had the highest profit margins on their vehicles of any car maker on earth by a wide margin.  The engineers did an amazing job figuring out how to make those cars efficiently.  It takes a huge investment to get a car company off the ground. The R&D is crazy and building factories are a gigantic upfront cost as well. It's one thing to design a great car, but it's another to mass produce it at a profit.  Again, it sucks that so many smart people in the company and their work is tarnished by their ketamine addicted CEO.  It really was a shining example of American ingenuity.  But again, I can't support them until Musk is completely removed from Tesla. For me, he needs to be removed as CEO and divest his shares.  I can't use even one penny of mine giving that psychopath more of an ability to drive our country into a fascist dictatorship.",Minute-Individual-74,2025-04-22T20:22:54,7
He basically fucked himself when he started posting on Twitter and getting into arguments with people and calling them pedophiles.

The Model Y (2019/2020) was released after Elon was a piece of shit related to the cave rescue (2018). No one with a Y or a Cybertruck gets a pass. Most Model 3s were also produced after that. Model S and X a little more leniency ,Altruistic-Award-2u,2025-04-22T23:48:04,8

Also while it was in the news, it wasn't nearly as headline-dominating as his rise into fascism has been, which visibly started in 2020 and his reaction to the Covid response.  I personally think if you bought it in 2018 to early 2020, you bought what was at that point probably the best option for an electric car and could overlook his...weirdness. 2020-early 2022, you knew you were buying from an asshole, and from the moment he bought X on, no more excuses.",Morganelefay,2025-04-23T01:42:22,7

"Yeah, at the end of the day Tesla has benefited massively from the government.  It goes beyond the credits too. Tesla isn’t forced to adhere to the same crash tests that other manufacturers do. They also refuse to admit fault in their self driving systems. And since the government doesn’t force them to hand over data, they deny responsibility and avoid lawsuits.   Tesla was always about battery development for spaceX. Elon succeeded in getting taxpayers and the government to fund his development. And what gets me is the cars are all economobiles but people view them as luxury. I just never got it I guess. The minimal interior just looks so cheap to me. ",3MATX,2025-04-22T21:42:19,7
"Yep. That's true. Hopefully the carbon credits system stays in place so competitors can take advantage of them in the same way.  America needs more options for consumers and the  knowledge and infrastructure to be able to produce them ourselves.  We are way too car dependent on this country to not have a firm grasp on those aspects of our economy.  A little off topic, but we also need to invest in other forms of transportation like bullet trains so we aren't as dependent on just cars and flights. Our public transportation is an embarrassing disaster.  But it seems like absolutely everything that helped increase competition and foster innovation is under attack so I unfortunately don't think it will be.",Minute-Individual-74,2025-04-22T21:40:23,3

"I really like the battery and charging technology, but 100% agree the interior finishes are cheap quality and the lack of actual buttons and lack of the display behind the steering wheel is so dumb.  I think their reputation for being ""luxury"" is due to the vehicles average performance. Electric vehicles have pretty instant torque so they can very easily feel exceptionally quick. So in regards to acceleration, they do beat out luxury brands at similar price points. But generally Tesla would need to improve in most other areas to actually compare to luxury brands. Also, it was viewed as a very cool car brand until recently. So it's popularity and brand recognition kind of placed them in that tier.  And to be fair, the gap between premium and economy brands have closed pretty significantly over that past decade. The difference between Toyotas and their Lexus counterparts are smaller than they've ever been in terms of finishes and performance. I think luxury brands really depend on their name and public perception of exclusivity more so than actual premium advantages.  Tesla plays games with the accidents caused by their full self driving and autopilot software. Which is one of the reasons Musk used doge to kill the department that was tracking accidents caused by self driving cars. Obvious and blatant corruption there. Should be enough to put him prison but we know rich people don't go to jail for their crimes.  I did not know their cars were not subjected to the same tests as the rest of the American automotive industry. Can you provide some sources on that? They were always rated very highly in most collision tests.  There's a few people starting a class action lawsuit against Tesla claiming their odometers put on way more miles than actually driven in order to void the warranty before certain parts wear out. And at this point, I don't think Musk deserves the benefit of the doubt. In my mind, that shit definitely happened unless a whole team of independent researchers prove it didn't. Elon Musk has lost all credibility.",Minute-Individual-74,2025-04-22T22:21:07,3
