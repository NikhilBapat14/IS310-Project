"“It is a fallacy to claim that both capitalism and communism can be strengthened simultaneously, as no lasting success has been evident so far”  I think it’s a fallacy to claim a progressive tax system or  a mixed-market economy (my examples) is communist etc. Now what’s your reasoning for no lasting success? The Nordic model (mixed market economy) has worked for them for a long time now. Every country is different and needs a different hybridization lead by market factors (capitalism) and social needs (socialism)",ChartIntelligent6320,2025-03-31T11:42:59,6
