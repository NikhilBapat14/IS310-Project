Why are Republicans/MAGA so afraid of LGBT people? There is probably a legitimate need for such a service.,foshi22le,2025-04-24T10:02:53,8
"The men and women of the SS, GeStaPo & the SD all became addicted to vicious cruelty between 1934-1945.  Although almost everyone who was infected by this most vile of addictions is now dead, the sickness has found excellent vectors within the ranks of Cheeto Hitler's administration & ICE.",Huge-Platypus9075,2025-04-24T09:26:12,6
"Stage a walk out. As soon as he starts speaking, get up and walk out or stand up and turn your backs to him. Fascists shouldn't be given a microphone to spew their hate and propaganda, but it's Alabama so I'm sure they're going to let the orange shitstain speak",Angedelanuit97,2025-04-24T09:53:14,3
"In all fairness, he fired a bunch of folks working for the Veterans Suicide Prevention Hotline and others working for the National Suicide Prevention Hotline, too ... so he's an Equal Opportunity Suicide Advocate.",phosdick,2025-04-24T10:45:09,3

"With the removal of Roe v Wade, the GOP needed a new ""cause"" to unite behind.  Their voters tend to feed on hate and religion, so they needed a new target to hate in order to keep the party united.  They appear to have picked LGBTQ folks as their newest target.  They've spun up their base to make them think ""the others"" are the enemy.  Whether those others are immigrants, non-Christians, people of different sexual orientations, etc.  They used the fear they stoked to get themselves into power.  Now that they're in power, they have to keep doing performative measures to show their base that they are combating the big bad evils that they made up.    The biggest problem, though, is that some of the GOP's own members have been taken in by the scare mongering and now hate these marginalized groups.  Like ""round them up and exterminate them"" levels of hate.  Those members need to be placated and kept in line as well.    So now here we are with the administration persecuting small groups of people in order to keep their ultra-conservative members in line and to keep feeding their base the red meat they need to keep voting.  It's all theater, but it's theater that is destroying the lives of people.",Nythoren,2025-04-24T10:34:13,4

"That sums up Fox News' mission completely. Stoking fear for political power. I've known a lot of people who are homosexual and there is nothing at all wrong with them as people, morally or otherwise. I just don't get the hate.",foshi22le,2025-04-24T10:38:54,2
