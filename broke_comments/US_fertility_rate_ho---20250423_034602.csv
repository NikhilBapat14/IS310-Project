Jokes on them. The trump administration is what made me decide to never have children,Angedelanuit97,2025-04-23T04:03:43,85
"Here's the thing. You can't legislate a baby boom.  * (pseudo)-Socialist China tried it (after seeing the disastrous effects of the 1-child policy), and failed. * (pseudo)-Islamic Iran tried it, and failed. * (pseudo)-Autocratic Russia tried it, and failed.  Despite all three being dictatorships that can leverage a far greater extent of state power against their own people than Western democracies, they still failed in this regard, and continue failing.  Turns out, you can force people to shut up, you can force people to hand over their money, you can force people to fight in a stupid war, you can force people to pretend believing in whatever God they are supposed to, you can take away people's freedoms or even their lives... but you can't force people to have kids.  (pseudo)-Democratic America will fail, too.   The only way to have a baby boom is to create positive circumstances for it to happen.   1. Affordable healthcare during and after pregnancy. 2. Affordable housing to raise kids in. 3. Affordable child care, or the possibility to raise children on a single income. 4. Affordable schooling for children to learn and develop. 5. Good career, social, and environmental outlook for children to thrive in as they grow into adulthood.  We are 0/5, and keep sinking further. No amount of force or propaganda is going to change this fact.",GeneReddit123,2025-04-23T03:46:13,88

"I love how Trump and Republican’s are as evil as possible as quickly as possible. They dismantle what pathetic little scraps of a social safety net that this country has. They start a pointless idiotic trade war with the entire world that will send prices that were already high through the roof, while also all but guaranteeing a recession at best and likely a depression. They’ve wiped out trillions in investments that people were counting on for their meager retirement’s. Never mind that childcare can cost as much as a second mortgage depending on where you live.  Then to top off their economic terrorism they institute such draconian anti abortion laws that women who miscarry a baby they wanted to have are facing prison sentences for manslaughter, or just left to bleed out in the parking because the hospital is afraid of being targeted legally for providing adequate care.  Then these evil assholes turn around and wonder why people don’t want to have kids!?! It’s just such a fucking joke. As a mid 30’s married childfree millennial I’ve never had less hope for the future of this country, and I feel such sympathy for the children brought into this conservative shit show.",bestforward121,2025-04-23T05:23:40,25

"Firstly, Gen Z has still a significant number of teenagers, and understandably, teen pregnancy is making the news like it always did. Doesn't make it either a unique phenomenon, nor a good one. Not even for long-term birth rates, because a teenager stuck with a baby they aren't equipped to take care of, will be very well deterred from having more babies down the road, and you need more than one child per parent to solve a falling birth rate.  Secondly, Millenials are in this unique position of (mostly) coming from a reasonably good childhood world, which taught them life skills (including family planning), but being released into an ultra-shitty adulthood world, the circumstances of which don't rise up to their own upbringing. If someone was properly taught the necessary criteria to decide having children (stable partnership, stable family financing, affordable healthcare, housing, childcare, schooling, etc.), and then see that *none* of the conditions are being met, they aren't going to rush into having children.   No decent parent wants their kids to have a worse life than they did, themselves. Even the Boomers didn't *intentionally* want their kids to suffer, it was just a byproduct of their myopic and selfish policies. If you've experienced a good life, you wouldn't want to have kids unless you knew their lives are likely to be at least as good as your own.  Who knows, perhaps Gen Z, having been raised from early childhood in an already shitty world, will not see their adulthood as any worse than their childhood, and so would have a lower deterrent against having kids.
