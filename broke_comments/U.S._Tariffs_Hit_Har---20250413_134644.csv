Honest question - does anyone actually think the tariffs hit them that badly just yet?  Is this headline just more click-bait hype?  Or have these recent tariffs ACTUALLY had an impact there already?,Narrow-Trash-8839,2025-04-13T15:50:13,135

"The Chinese Communist Party, which is just about everyone (they murder the opposition) knows how to play a game.  It has only been a few days so there are no factories closing in China, this is a manipulation and part of the CCP’s strategy to say “look what you are doing to us”, all smoke and mirrors, now if this goes on for months and months then yes, CCP will be hurting as they should. They will not win this.  How do western reporters have access to Chinese speaking owners of Chinese businesses in China? What, all of a sudden, free press in China? 🇨🇳 Give me break, these interviews are propaganda and the CCP approved them for a reason, manipulation!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-13T14:50:31,48
"But I thought ""China will weather this. They don't give a rip. Other countries still do trade with them. India will just replace the US as their top exporter. The US is only 20% of their exports. They won't even blink at this.""",ITrCool,2025-04-13T14:45:43,41

"The stamping out of dissent/reason (mentioned starting at 14:48) in their own country urging them to embrace a free market strategy, will ultimately lead to the CCP's downfall. It's better to make the counter argument publicly and support it, *even with propaganda if you must*, than revert to silencing all the intelligent voices you have available to you. The smart move was for China not to retaliate, and even offer up some superficial concession to make the US look completely unreasonable, if they persisted, to the rest of the international community. Instead, by retaliating as they did, they validated the US position that they were already engaged in a trade war.",According-Activity87,2025-04-13T14:36:47,2

"I heard they had ships loaded and at sea but with no where to go. I dont think factories would be selling equipment this early unless business were actively packing up and moving. However i don’t find that to be true this early even if the tariffs were 1,000 percent effective.",slampig3,2025-04-13T17:07:07,23
">does anyone actually think the tariffs hit them that badly just yet?  Yes. So much of what gets bought from China is then sold at such thin profit margins that the tariffs could easily have made those purchases a net loss for the buyers. That stuff might ultimately get sold and shipped anyway once downstream pricing gets sorted out, but even if people are willing to pay the extra for whatever cheap stuff it is, that delay hurts.   Especially since Chinese manufacturing was hurting even before the tariffs.",Alpha-Sierra-Charlie,2025-04-14T06:41:11,4

"I'm so sad to see American labor disappearing over the course of my life. Textiles is just one of the many industries impacted by cheap foreign labor. At the turn of the last century, we had 10 times the textile mills we have today, and the mills we do have are always struggling to stay operative.   Our whole family has been grateful that my dad was able to get a job in a steel mill for a company that knows how to take care of its employees in this crazy market. They introduced profit sharing and production bonuses early on, and that ensured production was constantly at peak performance. They have also resisted laying off employees over the decades, and that impacted our family in a positive way. My mom and dad, neither of whom graduated high school, were able to provide a good education for us kids and both my brother and I are college graduates.  Bring manufacturing back to the United States.",obscurityknocks,2025-04-14T05:33:05,4

That's kind of what I thought as well. The CCP likely doesn't care about the suffering of their citizens. They are likely willing to let their society suffer as long as it doesn't make them look weak to the rest of the world.,the_house_from_up,2025-04-13T16:00:52,3

"I'm all for healthy skepticism, but having heard accounts from friends who lived in China, I think you're giving the CCP way more credit than they deserve in this regard. They don't really have it nearly together as many who haven't been there seem to think here; at least by all the accounts I've heard. They're pretty clumsy at managing their people and information. No matter the scheme, big government tends to be slow and stupid.",According-Activity87,2025-04-13T15:24:11,8
