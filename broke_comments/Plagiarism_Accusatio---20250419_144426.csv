">The order is an embarrassing blow to plaintiffs representing San Juan, and threatens to discredit and upend their case altogether.    Good❗️👀",GiediOne,2025-04-19T22:59:16,7
"A federal judge in Puerto Rico issued a scathing order last week accusing Democratic prosecutors on the island of plagiarizing nearly their entire 241-page complaint that blamed oil companies for causing global warming. In the order Wednesday, district court judge Aida Delgado-Colon outlined how David Efron, the lead attorney representing Puerto Rico’s capital city San Juan, appears to have plagiarized a similar but separate complaint that 16 Puerto Rican municipalities filed a year earlier. A side-by-side comparison of the two complaints shows large blocks of text are copied word-for-word.  This is just what democrats are and what they do, shame on them!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-20T03:36:58,5
