Are the¬†deep-state criminals in the room with us now Tulsi?,thegoodnamesrgone123,2025-04-23T21:57:43,135
They keep blaming Biden and the ‚Äúdeep state‚Äù for the incompetent things they have done.,nrdb29,2025-04-23T22:01:08,49
"From the article:    Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said she made two criminal referrals on Wednesday related to alleged leaks in the intelligence community and said a third referral is ‚Äúon its way.‚Äù  In a post on the social platform X, Gabbard said the third criminal referral ‚Äúincludes the recent illegal leak to the Washington Post,‚Äù without elaborating on details.   ‚ÄúPoliticization of our intelligence and leaking classified information puts our nation‚Äôs security at risk and must end,‚Äù Gabbard said in her statement. ‚ÄúThose who leak classified information will be found and held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.‚Äù  Gabbard said she looks forward to working with federal law enforcement to prosecute the ‚Äúdeep-state criminals‚Äù allegedly involved.    ‚ÄúThese deep-state criminals leaked classified information for partisan political purposes to undermine POTUS‚Äô agenda. I look forward to working with @TheJusticeDept and @FBI to investigate, terminate and prosecute these criminals,‚Äù she wrote.   What a fucking joke",kootles10,2025-04-23T21:56:30,18

Why did Joe Biden make us so stupid? -GOP,TheorySudden5996,2025-04-23T22:53:56,5
Russki Gabbard has been looking so sad since being sworn in as Homeland Security Director. Maybe her snuggle buddy Putin has been ghosting her since she showed the entire world that she doesn‚Äôt know how to keep secrets secret.,heismanwinner82,2025-04-23T22:03:13,7
