"I don’t.  It’s an artificial deadline and any decision has already been made, this is a little more than an attempt to give it a veneer of credibility.   Any decision is 100% based on what this administration thinks they can get away with.  ",Another_mikem,2025-04-15T12:15:12,269
I am freaked out he chose Hitler's birthday for this authoritarian announcement.  I have little doubt about the (fake) decision.  SCOTUS better hold up.  Congress better act to impeach.,parallelmeme,2025-04-15T12:57:32,183
"It's a nightmare. The only consolation I see, is that when Trump is out of our lives, these previously unabused powers can be used to bring justice to the 'radical right lunatics'. The next Democratic administration should grab the Salvadorean president and toss him in prison here and throw away the key for major human rights abuses. And all other Nazi enablers, like Stephen Miller.  REMEMBER THE NUREMBERG TRIALS!",Inevitable-Peace7,2025-04-15T12:51:36,103
"Seems kind of silly that they've been pulling down smaller deportation numbers than Biden and bragging that there's been a precipitous drop in border crossings... but are still seemingly determined to declare a crisis.  Reasoning kind of falls on its face, doesn't it?  Like, just come out and say you want to seize absolute control. At this point, it seems unlikely that our elected officials, SCOTUS, or half the actively voting public are going to care at all.",Generation_ABXY,2025-04-15T13:30:52,29

"This!. This is a very easy win for the democrats, all the could say is “we are taking names so when all comes back to normal and the rule of law becomes norm again, all those people harassing brown people, all those people breaking laws will be brought to justice and punished swiftly and hard so be wary of what you do”.
