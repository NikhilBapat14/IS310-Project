"To be fair to Hegseth, he was probably drunk when he did this. Are we going to get upset over *everything* anyone has ever done after they've had one too many drinks?",ghands1,2025-04-22T10:47:31,6
Is this why children fear clowns?,Beantown-Jack,2025-04-22T10:49:42,1
This means he declassified the information … then he shared information form as classified source.      If this was the UK clearly a breach of the official secrets act….  Even after years I’m still bound to share nothing with anybody.  But this cowboy just share at will.   Wow no wonder NATO partners are pissed.,nobackup42,2025-04-22T12:14:41,1
