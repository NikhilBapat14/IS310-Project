"That illustration of the American flag turned into a fence and barbed wire hits hard. I think it's an accurate representation of what America has turned into.  This is a great article that breaks it down in a way that's easy to understand. American citizens need to care. This is why Kilmar Abrego Garcia's case matters. It matters for him and his family of course, but it also matters on a larger scale. He was banned from being deported to El Salvador because of a judge's order, but that was ignored. If the trump administration can get away with sending Abrego Garcia to El Salvador and leaving him there, they can get away with sending ***anyone*** out of the country.  This isn't a ""distraction of the day."" This is an administration that's breaking the law and sending people out of the country into **lifelong imprisonment.** So yes, Democrats need to keep talking about this and keep taking action!",sachiprecious,2025-04-23T18:03:06,15
