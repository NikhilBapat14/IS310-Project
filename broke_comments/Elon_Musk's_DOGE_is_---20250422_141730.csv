"Interior Secretary Doug¬†Burgum signed away significant control of the Interior Department in a secretarial order Thursday night. The¬†order¬†gives a DOGE operative, Tyler Hassen, the power to oversee the Interior Department for ‚Äúconsolidation, unification and optimization of administrative functions.‚Äù¬†  It directs Hassen, DOGE‚Äôs assistant secretary of policy, management and budget, to make funding decisions, fire employees, create policy, oversee programs and transfer funds. Hassen is a former oil executive who worked for Basin Energy, an oil field equipment company, before joining the Trump administration.¬†",sfgate,2025-04-22T14:19:05,55
"This is what MORE government looks like. Not less. Burgum was confirmed by a senate, of which people voted for those senators. Now Burgum has given massive power to an unelected official. Ceding power to other people because something is hard is how we ended up with 'big government.'   Congrats to all those who have a negative concept of freedom. Firing national parks workers does not lead to less government.",Skiinz19,2025-04-22T14:34:38,35

">Late last week, Elon Musk‚Äôs Department of Government Efficiency essentially took over the Interior Department, which includes the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Indian Affairs and more. The Interior Department is supposed to oversee 400 national parks and historic sites, uphold treaty rights with over 500 recognized Native American tribes, manage more than 500 million acres of land and conserve the country‚Äôs fish and wildlife.   How the *fuck* is this efficient? Nobody at DOGE knows how to run parks! Ah, right. It's got nothing to do with efficiency, only consolidating power. And taking a big dump on conservationists and Native Americans along the way.",brain_overclocked,2025-04-22T15:49:33,22
