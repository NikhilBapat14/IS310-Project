"[](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/maggie-haberman-pete-hegseth-interview_n_6808f240e4b0bd5208092463)  **From reporter Pocharapon Neammanee:**  New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman said that President Donald Trump’s White House is less than pleased with how Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has been handling the recent controversies within the Pentagon.  Hegseth faced major scrutiny this week after the Times published a report detailing chaos and distrust that has been running rampant at the Defense Department.  In addition to reportedly sharing military information with his family, lawyer and close associates in a second Signal group chat, Hegseth also turned heads after firing aides last week, suggesting that they leaked information to the media.  Hegseth appeared Tuesday on “Fox & Friends,” blaming “deep state forces” for the Pentagon’s chaos.  “They’ve come after me from day one,” Hegseth said. “Just like they’ve come after President Trump. And I’ve gotten a fraction of what President Trump got in that first term. What he’s endured is superhuman.”  According to Haberman, Hegseth’s interview did not sit well with the White House.
