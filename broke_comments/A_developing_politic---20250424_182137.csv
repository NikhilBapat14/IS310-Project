So to summarize: he stole Medicaid money from children to fund a Super PAC that campaigned on putting more black people in jail for weed.  Sack of shit.,gradientz,2025-04-24T18:25:08,1
"I wasnâ€™t aware scandals were a thing that could negatively impact the GOP anymore. You canâ€™t shame people into behaving differently or resigning and fading into obscurity when theyâ€™re incapable of shame and the reward for being in power is too awesome.   Not to mention, you canâ€™t force them to resign in shame when theyâ€™ve looked around and watched their peers get away with it time and again, knowing full well people will forget all about their scandal when someone else does something even worse tomorrow.",EggsAndMilquetoast,2025-04-24T18:32:17,1

How much yall wanna bet Trump behind this?   I doubt Republicans give a damn about money going to a group that uses it to fight against weed. Small ego Trump probably wants to get rid of people were disloyal to him so he got into contact with Florida Republicans to hurt Desantis politically.,wizgset27,2025-04-24T18:48:42,1

"What a criminal loser couple, that was state money! So brazen.   From article: Ten million dollars of the settlement was paid directly to a non-profit group, Hope Florida. That's a charity founded by Gov. DeSantis' wife, Casey, to help people move off government assistance into community-based programs.  An investigation by state lawmakers found that after receiving it, Hope Florida transferred the $10 million to two ""dark money"" political groups â€” groups that aren't required to disclose their donors",Fit-Significance-436,2025-04-24T22:35:50,1

Wouldn't be surprised if it's Trump camp behind the push. There will be a GOP civil war long before an actual US one I think. I'm hoping for within the next year.,ResignedFate,2025-04-24T19:53:11,1
Pardons require trials in past tense... The future is too bleak to expect something so expected. Especially when the crime aligns with federal executive policy goals,Available_Usual_9731,2025-04-24T22:14:36,1
