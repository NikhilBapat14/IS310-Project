"I work covering solar. Domestic panel assemblers require solar cells (the squares) to make panels. Only one company makes solar cells in the U.S. and they‚Äôre founded by a Chinese guy - ES Foundry. So domestic manufacturers will have to pay tariffs on imported solar cells. The alternative technology is thin film, which doesn‚Äôt use solar cells at all. First Solar (FSLR) is the only company doing that and they‚Äôre massively expanding in the U.S.  they benefit the most from these tariffs as it gives them strong pricing power. Their tech is worse than the solar cell technology (lower conversion of light to energy) and they were more expensive but now will likely be cheapest and most bankable (means reliable to get what you need when you need it) option.",Educational-Ad1680,2025-04-22T08:28:31,15
"The same people who want solar would be the same people complaining domestic mining of rate earth minerals. It'd be great if we could ramp up both domestic mining and domestic production. It would add a host of blue collar AND white collar jobs, from engineering and panel developmemt to ongoing panel installation and repair (HVAC style).",NotSoAnonymous2nd,2025-04-22T19:15:23,3
"Reddit appears to be responding as you would expect to some new proposed tariffs on solar panels (up to 3,521%!!!) and suggesting this is an arbitrary and capricious attempt to destroy our domestic solar industry in favor of oil and gas.  Since we prefer logic and reason over misguided speculation, I thought I would share this article which explains what‚Äôs really going on. This is a response to an ITC anti-dumping/countervailing duty (AD/CVD) case that started under Biden. It‚Äôs been in the works for over a year and targets specific companies. Domestic panel assemblers are not producing near their capacity, and this trade enforcement will help them do so.  The more you know üåà",zip117,2025-04-22T06:48:24,3
We have oil and coal why do we all of a sudden care about solar? Did I miss something?,Bfletcher89,2025-04-22T10:05:20,2

China is the largest producer of cadmium telluride. And they have just blocked the sale of rare earth minerals to the US so don't think the price will be coming down anytime    https://www.solarbeglobal.com/chinas-export-control-on-cadmium-telluride-poses-challenges-to-u-s-solar-company/,Competitive-Cash303,2025-04-22T09:10:16,12
"That‚Äôs true, but these tariffs are based on an ITC anti-dumping/countervailing duty (AD/CVD) investigation with CVD being the major component in most cases. You can see the detailed breakdown in the article. CVD is specifically meant to counteract foreign government subsidies to create a level playing field. It‚Äôs not meant to directly give American manufacturers a competitive advantage except against companies who don‚Äôt play fair.  Completely normal tariff policy that you would see from any administration.",zip117,2025-04-22T09:32:26,3
Oil and coal will eventually run out so investing in renewable energy is a good thing if you care about the future generations,ExcitementPast7700,2025-04-22T15:27:04,6

"Well, it‚Äôs renewable for one, but it meets a more immediate need for decentralized energy infrastructure to promote energy independence. Compared to other renewables, capital investment is relatively low and you can build solar farms across the country. Combined with battery storage, microgrids provide flexibility and resilience independent from the main grid in the case of natural disaster or an attack from a foreign adversary. I think those are benefits everyone can get behind.  Liberals are always talking about Trump‚Äôs war on clean energy, but to my knowledge that only involves offshore wind projects which are expensive and have real environmental impacts.  Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but I don‚Äôt think opposition to solar is a popular conservative position, except occasionally in the domestic context because it‚Äôs not as capital efficient and people often get taken advantage of by unscrupulous installers.",zip117,2025-04-22T10:23:34,7
Yeah if this continues we will probably need significant domestic investment in REE recycling. A few companies are already doing it like Umicore but the scale just isn‚Äôt there yet.,zip117,2025-04-22T09:47:27,2
"Moderate here chiming in for your last point, I have been screamed and cussed at by super pro trump coworkers for putting solar on my house. It‚Äôs a very popular opinion around me that solar panels are the worst thing to happen to energy production. I also work at a facility that produces electricity primarily by burning trees which is also a renewable energy source. There are a couple more that I work with that have or are interested in panels for solely your first point so obviously not every pro trumper is following that bandwagon but the anti solar voices are significantly louder.  Your first point is basically why I went with solar panels to begin with. I want to be off the teet of the power company. Do you know how freeing it is to basically be your own power plant? I do. It‚Äôs awesome. Pair that with an electric car and I basically have free gas. I wake up in the morning with a full tank every day. With a plug in hybrid vehicle a home solar array with a battery could be supplemented by gasoline power as well, being significantly more efficient than a stand alone gas generator. Solar and plug in hybrids seem to be our best bet for individual energy independence.  Also fwiw I‚Äôm generally in support of these particular tariffs despite the Reddit outrage. Only one small section is being charged the ridiculous 3000% rate (and they deserve it) but Reddit will have you thinking it‚Äôs all panels. Other manufacturers are having significantly smaller tariffs and many with no extra tariffs at all. Reddit will have you thinking it‚Äôs all foreign produced panels but that‚Äôs not true at all.",DrivingHerbert,2025-04-22T11:56:41,9
"""Completely normal tariff policy that you would see from any administration.""

"Just like our liberal friends who are unaware that these highly-targeted AD/CVD tariffs are completely independent of the Trump administration‚Äôs broad-based tariffs, there are also low-information conservatives. What likely happens is they hear some arguments that domestic solar *subsidies* are bad‚Äîwhich they are, because they are an inefficient use of public funds and prone to abuse‚Äîand use that to make unjustified assumptions about solar as a whole. It‚Äôs not really informed opposition, and for that matter there‚Äôs far more opposition to grid-scale solar from leftists complaining about the environmental impact. I‚Äôve done geotechnical design work for a couple solar farms and all of this is taken into consideration during permitting and erosion control design. Leftists don‚Äôt know that of course, or they have some ulterior motive, because they don‚Äôt truly give a shit about the environment like we do. Conservation is literally in our name.  Obviously nobody who actually lives off the grid would be ideologically opposed to domestic solar because it‚Äôs an ideal path to individual energy independence, and these folks are *overwhelmingly* conservative. I hope your coworkers will eventually cross paths with the ‚Äòother side‚Äô and change their minds‚Ä¶",zip117,2025-04-22T12:31:57,1

"My Democrat friend, this is the new age. Read Trump‚Äôs EO [Unleashing American Energy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/). The only reason solar is not a *priority* energy resource for us at this time is because of insecurity in the domestic supply chain for rare earth minerals. Trump is working to resolve that, though there is some minor disagreement among some of us here as to the means.  I haven‚Äôt seen anyone here who is ideologically opposed to solar as one of our many affordable and reliable energy resources. I can‚Äôt imagine why you would be.",zip117,2025-04-22T17:11:03,3
"Hey OP, are you enjoying your experiment with turning flaired off? Because the results of the experiment are exactly the same as **every other time** the experiment is conducted. We have flaired mode because our haters never brought anything of value and they never will.  *With that out of the way,* I notice from the article that Malaysia's deal is much different from Cambodia's deal. Negotiating with us pays, spiting us costs.  The people following us around throwing stink aren't going to trade their stink for civility just because you spend time and energy on them.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-22T23:44:38,1
"I was was hoping it would be more entertaining rather than productive, but as usual you‚Äôre right. They can‚Äôt even come up with good insults. ‚òπÔ∏è  I noticed that too about Cambodia, and I was curious about the nature of the subsidies which pushed the CVD rates *that* high for those companies. The ITC scope of investigation is very specific‚Äîto the level of construction details for specific products‚Äîand *theoretically* the investigation should be based solely on the evidence in the record for the relevant period of interest (2023) so political negotiation shouldn‚Äôt even be a factor. This is a really complex case and I haven‚Äôt gone through all the details yet, but it looks like the rates are mostly based on various loan programs and ‚Äòdonations‚Äô (‚Äúless than adequate remuneration‚Äù) of critical input materials from China: polysilicon, wafers, glass, silver paste‚Ä¶  **TL;DR:** everything keeps coming back to China‚Äôs unfair trade practices. The more I look at cases like this and see the level of market manipulation, the more I can appreciate Trump‚Äôs aggressive approach to China.

The Commerce [announcement](https://www.trade.gov/final-affirmative-determinations-antidumping-and-countervailing-duty-investigations-crystalline) lists all the case numbers.",zip117,2025-04-23T02:05:33,1
