"Thats the opposite direction the majority of Americans want to go and an affront to our shared mythology of ""being a melting pot that accepts all the discarded of other nations"" We do need new parties but the fact that we lack them is a consequence of our voting system.  The United State's government is OLD in comparison to other nations that got re-established during the major wars. Because it was one of the first the flaws in it are more obvious. We dont have a breaking system like many european governments and we are stuck in a 2 party system. Things breaking into tiny parties I think will result in the establishment of really toxic subnations like what happened in Utah.",zayelion,2025-04-15T09:50:41,19
"I think encouraging distinct sub national governments would further push the U.S. towards just breaking up. Many individuals, especially in one party dominant states, would want to either nationalize their unique system or break off.",1QAte4,2025-04-15T09:46:52,5

"This is the ideal the US is built on. It made a lot more sense in the days of the Articles of Confederation and 13 colonies. It arguably kept working like this until the Civil War.   It is not the reality of the nation, especially given how many states are just random lines on a map.",Lefaid,2025-04-15T11:16:42,1
"How would you “encourage” that? You’d have to reverse decades of trends of state politics becoming nationalized, and it’d probably involve reversing media consumption trends - the average voter isn’t subscribed to local or state newspapers, and instead gets their politics news from outlets and social media accounts that have a national audience. People don’t know or care enough about state and local politics to develop unique views centered around them.",avfc41,2025-04-15T12:33:40,1
"**1. They award power basically in the federal arms in ways that don't reflect the idea of a single voter having equal power regardless of where they are**  By design in the Senate. States are sovereign with a very high degree of autonomy.  **2. Cultural distinctness as a measure of greater or lesser sub-national autonomy to (better) justify the undemocratic nature of the U.S. with regard to the Senate and E.C.**  Good point!   You are right that certain non-unitary states have some very distinct regions. Catalonia, Basque Country, Quebec, hell - even Scotland and Wales . .   One would think, these are separate *peoples* and therefore deserve to chart their own destinies. Fair! That is the basis of nation states, at least those based on ethnicity and not an idea.  The U.S. at the beginning was much more regionally distinct than it is now. Post WWII, regional accents are dying thanks to ease of transport and ubiquitous media. The deep Southern Drawl or Appalachian speak and even deep NYC/Boston/Tidewater accents are dying out. One rarely hears them anymore outside of old shows and old people.  . . . .  The modern person looks around and says, 'we are all Americans, not much separates me living in L.A. as a person in Atlanta' and someone in rural Texas has more in common with someone in rural Alaska than they might in Dallas.  State regional differences are disappearing in favor of rural/urban cultural difference - with the suburbs being the grey zone.   Every city is blue.   All the burbs are purple.   All the small towns are red.   That makes the undemocratic nature of the Senate more galling (to some) today. The unspoken question is 'why do these states deserve this much power' - at least at the expense of the popular will of the people as a whole.  The answer is that they always *have had that power* and that little tidbit is the only non-amendable feature of the Constitution because the framers wanted state sovereignty that badly.  Changing that status is an exercise in futility.",neosituation_unknown,2025-04-15T16:55:37,1
"I mean we basically already have this.   - Nebraska has a non-partisan unicameral legislature.   - Nebraska and Maine split their electoral votes.   - New York, Minnesota and North Dakota have different parties that substitute for the democrats in statewide elections similar to how the CSU is to the CDU in Germany.   - Vermont has a third party in their legislature.  - Alaska creates coalitions that transcend party lines.   - Puerto Rico, while not a US State, is a part of the US and has their own completely separate party system.",Lord_Waldymort,2025-04-15T13:09:23,1
"Is the CSU really that different from the DFL in Minnesota?   Otherwise I don’t see regional parties as like in the near future. They tend to require a pretty strong regional identity or history. Perhaps if PR becomes a state. Also I don’t really see a benefit?   Because there are only two parties, intra-state party politics already vary a fair bit. Republican governors in Mass and MD are quite different from those in Texas or Florida.",JonDowd762,2025-04-15T12:41:11,0
"NO! The problem of states in the US is missing funds. Most states got no tax-income,  those states are just a political construct to keep the Republican in power.  In Germany all states got their own income, their own right and power to exist..",nick5erd,2025-04-15T09:37:44,-4

Probably making the states have proportional elections for Congress and their own governments. And allowing for broad electoral alliances that collectively nominate a candidate the way that in the EU they have Spitzenkandidaten despite the differences of the composite parties at the member state levels.,Awesomeuser90,2025-04-15T13:06:08,1
"It isn't only cultural distinctiveness. There are a few other things that would play into it. And it wouldn't make it so that it must be entirely different for every single state, some places will almost inherently have some things in common like Vermont and New Hampshire having a good deal of things in common.  Part of the issue I see is that a lot of what the federal government is assigned to do and the mechanisms it has to do it can some ideas very strange. For instance, creating a universal healthcare system. The federal government doesn't have that power directly, but does have it indirectly, or at least the power to create important elements of it, via some rather creative applications of ideas and laws and the funding power it has. Even if a huge part of the country might agree on an idea such as universal education perhaps for children, making it so that there is such a system is hard to do in a universal way without a large amount of activity from a federal government.   In contrast, in Canada, the law that makes provinces all have a universal healthcare system is literally two pages long, and a third of the document is just based on how a federal minister is supposed to deal with some grants and verify how this is being implemented, with 23 sections (excluding the preamble). If the constitution had a specific mandate for all the states to do this, then it wouldn't really be necessary to do things the hard way with intricate and non-intuitive ideas that make the states do weird things in alignment but rebel on other things in non-helpful ways.   Much like how the US goes to great lengths to make some pretty poor choices about who can vote. Instead of a very simple statement such as all natural persons who are at least sixteen years of age or older have the right to vote, it has a half dozen amendments on who can't be denied the vote. The revenue system in the US, convoluted it is, also makes it really hard for states to raise revenue in order to fund themselves and makes the federal government oddly powerful compared to what it reasonably should be. It would be a challenge to do something like impose a corporate tax state by state because of the way corporate registration and economic activity take place, and so you see weird rules like companies incorporating in Delaware for instance. It would help the states to have a rule like they can make a rule for them all, which cannot be broken with the incentives of a cartel (such as OPEC) to cheat the rules, so that they all must maintain a certain minimum tax rate, but they keep the revenue for themselves and don't put it in a federal deposit.  Coming up with a better way to allow this kind of diversity, while requiring all the states to be strong multi party democracies in their own right with strong human rights, a basic floor of economic and environmental sustainability below which people cannot find themselves trapped in, independent judiciaries and prosecution services, have strong governmental ethics and transparency, and have few problems with campaign finance, as the floor allows them to develop from there in the paths that are well suited to them individually. German federal law has a list of categories of federal responsibilities which the Bundestag can legislate alone, a list of things that both the states and federation can do which needs the German Senate (Bundesrat)'s consent to do, and the rest is up to the states and it works pretty well for letting them be as they wish in a diverse federation.",Awesomeuser90,2025-04-15T17:14:08,1
"Nebraska and Maine really don't have anything to do with this. If the same party happens to have a plurality of the votes, say 51%, in each district then all of the votes of the state go to that candidate. They don't give 3 electors to one candidate and 2 electors for the other one.   While these are differences you identify and certainly have some uses in making examples, they are rather obscure for most people and there is not so much of a sense of them being nations unto themselves. Hawai'i might be a better example given how unique the system is there, the demography, and how it was a genuinely independent kingdom for a hundred years and quite a strong identity of a people contrasting with Indiana for example.",Awesomeuser90,2025-04-15T13:52:32,0
"Eh, Bavaria is by far the most populous German state. It would have a similar fraction of the population as California has of America as does  Bavaria have of Germany.   It also helps in Germany that you see a lot of diversity in which coalition makes up the government and legislatures of the states. The Bundesrat is a relatively good chart for this at a glance. The US basically only has either Democratic or Republican governments, with Alaska having a peculiar coalition and a few of the territories having their own ideas and a few unique parties like in Puero Rico.   You see in former East Germany too where the AfD, Die Linke, and the BSW dominate much of the politics. The Greens actually control the prime mimistership of Baden Württemburg. Some of the Northwest has a very strong SPD, given that is where the industrial workers of Germany tended to be most active, along with coal extraction. And other patterns. Germany also has these states way, way preceding the existence of even the Iroquois, like the Bavarii and the Swabians, Saxons, and more. They were often legitimate full kingdoms in some cases like Saxony and own royal houses, and the federal government in Germany did basically nothing to establish the states as they became, whereas in the US, a majority of states were forged by federal delineation and a majority of them are less than 200 years old, with many of the controversies of their existence still around like the way that Kansas blew up the nation in 1857, and some can be seen as gerrymandering for bad reasons like the Missouri Compromise creating an arbitrary number of states just to keep a senate balance or the way the two Dakotas ended up as distinct polities.",Awesomeuser90,2025-04-15T13:04:42,1
"> ""Is the CSU really that different from the DFL in Minnesota?""  Yes, vastly different.  And observably so, too.  Minnesota's DFL and North Dakota's D-NPL are nothing but semantics in today's age; it's no longer the turn of the 20th century, while a devout Christian social democrat like William Jennings Bryan ain't walking through that door.  Conservative Party of New York State and Working Families Party are a bit of a different beast, but in practice those are nothing more than a nominal minor parties.",NoExcuses1984,2025-04-16T13:38:18,1

"I mean I’m not sure what you’re looking for then? You’re not wrong about your comments on Maine/Nebraska but it’s still a different method of assigning electors than other states which is what you mentioned in your post.   If you mean states that have a sense of their own national identities you could make arguments for Texas, Hawaii and California, but none of those three have a radically different political system. And of course Puerto Rico again, which has its own political parties, its own culture, and a historical nationalist movement.   And on the flip side you mention some examples in your post like Catalonia and Quebec which have different political parties but not particularly different political systems from other states in their respective countries (as far as I’m aware?). And the role of the CSU is again not that different from the role of say the Working Families or DFL.",Lord_Waldymort,2025-04-15T15:26:38,1
"But isn’t this just a multi-party democracy? IIRC the only true regional party in the Bundestag is a couple seats for a Danish-speaking party in Schleswig Holstein.

"Bavaria is the largest by area. The largest by population is Northrhine-Westphalia   Furthermore the US states have more autonomy than the German states.

"Check the income of Alabama or Utah or so, most of their state budget comes from Washigton DC.  You cant give someone real power over a budget of others.

"It might be a bit like that time a judge said that he couldn't define porn but he could tell if he saw it.   It is a combination of the party systems, the governmental systems, the history of how the place came to be, the culture a place has and sense of self, the degree to which you see divergence on policy choices from other places, and whether those representing the place will more so decide based on the demands back home vs the alignment with their association at the collective scale.   For instance, you see Utah having some pretty vastly different ideas on things despite being known as a Republican stronghold, having such a distinct system in play and such a strong sense of a collective identity that isn't really explained by some difference likw how Utah allows for ballot measures in a way Kentucky doesn't.",Awesomeuser90,2025-04-15T16:48:57,1
"Differs by country. Belgium is even more different. Canada's Quebec having a whole spectrum are two good examples. Spain's Basque and Catalonia communities can be examples. Canada's provinces often have unique parties, Saskatchewan has the Saskatchewan Party, Yukon has the Yukon party, BC has the BC United Party, and Alberta has the United Conservative Party in power, all of which are right wing parties and have nothing to do with the federal Conservative parties or in fact any institutional link with any other party at all. Australia has a couple of parties a bit like this although it is not as obvious. Argentina is a federal republic and has almost the same constitutional architecture as the United States and the two main electoral coalitions are really made of smaller parties which operate in different provinces. The United Kingdom has the Scottish National Party, Wales has Plaid Cymru, Northern Ireland has a completely different set of parties and British areas like Gibraltar and The Isle of Man have different parties altogether as well, Man has the Tynwald as one of the oldest parliaments in the world, actually might be the oldest in fact.",Awesomeuser90,2025-04-15T13:47:26,1
