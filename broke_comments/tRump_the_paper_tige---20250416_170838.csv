It is a legal loss. And some legal losses can create precedents that influence future decisions. He personally never had any money on the line. It's our taxpayer money he is playing with like it's monopoly.,Inevitable-Peace7,2025-04-17T10:41:00,3
"Yep, and unless Trump suffers consequences the only precedent this sets is that the president can do whatever he wants whenever he wants, not that the president has been or even can be held accountable. Unless Trump suffers personal consequences to this ruling, that are enforced, then it's worse than he getting away with it scot free, he's spitting in the face of the justice system.  Precedent? This is not a victory unless Trump suffers actual consequences. Unless Trump does, this and any other ruling is worse than meaningless: It provides precedent that Trump and anyone like him can do whatever they want and no one can stop them. Without consequences this ruling is only going to weaken the rule of law, not strengthen it.",immortalfrieza2,2025-04-17T14:24:09,1
