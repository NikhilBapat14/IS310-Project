"People come up to me all the time, seabed miners who never cried even when people said they had no love, they come up to me and they say ""Sir, we'd like very much to do the seabed."" And I ask them: is this about the tape? But they're talking about the land under the waters and using it for mining, OK? I know all about the sea, believe me. I know more than the dolphins, who are supposed to be the smartest animals in the sea according to my J.D. Frankly, a dolphin couldn't answer all the questions right like I did. You know we used to mine all the seas but we don't do that anymore because we want to be so open and so free. We won't even pick up the nickels even though they're everywhere. The nickels, and the quarters, they're all being picked up by the Manganese now. That's what they don't tell you.",wonkalicious808,2025-04-24T18:04:09,1
Is it even worth even to do this?  It's not going to be cheap.  You can ve assured that taxpayers will pay for all the mining while private companies will take all the profits.,clueless_in_ny_or_nj,2025-04-24T18:16:38,1
"The green party needs to come out in full support of it, calling it more eco friendly than windmills . Then trump will hate it and drop any further discussion of it.",O918,2025-04-24T20:00:24,1
"I don’t think the rest of the world will allow it, and Trump will end up looking like a weak-ass dipshit, like he does over and over.   I really try and understand other people’s views, but I can’t wrap my mind around continuing to support this man.   It’s like he’s trolling them. He’s making them debase themselves. It’s honestly sad to see. They’re so far gone that it’s such a long way back. When, oh when, will they wake up???",hiding_in_de,2025-04-24T18:22:27,1

"No, I’m sure it would be completely stupid (infeasible) in a multitude of ways. Not to mention the fact that the international community would never stand for it. He’s really absolutely shitting all over our former allies.",hiding_in_de,2025-04-24T18:23:36,1
