Dude around while the FDA allowed Pfizer to move on after canceling their already greatly reduced testing?     Which completely undermined the entirety of informed consent?  Fuckem,spezeditedcomments,2025-04-15T09:04:11,52
"All while denying the side effects of the vaccine and the lab leak origin.   This is what happens when orgs become partisan, they don‚Äôt work for the people anymore.  Edit: ahhh I see the brainwashed brigaders are on their downvoting spree. Sorry guys. Truth hurts. Maybe open your eyes and look outside the BS that has been fed to you for the last 4.5 years. We were lied to.",dottedoctet,2025-04-15T09:53:23,74

"Just get rid of the FDA in its entirety. If the American people want vaccines, they're free to negotiate with private entities to secure vaccination.  ""Public health"" and ""epidemiology"" are basically just codewords for stripping away our freedoms!",T0XxXiXiTy,2025-04-15T12:00:30,-122

"Did you watch his confirmation hearings? Senator Cassidy‚Äîa physician and Republican from Louisiana‚Äîprovides the answer:  > And then I got a text from a former employee of the NIH, I emphasize the former, who says that in early in the President Trump‚Äôs term, you and colleagues sent 90 papers for review by people at NIH. They felt like these, the NIH folks felt that without exception, they were severely lacking methodologically and/or found that they indeed showed the safety of these vaccines. ‚ÄúWe tried to engage Mr. Kennedy, but his colleagues refused to acknowledge the expertise of dozens of NIH scientists we made about those papers.‚Äù  It‚Äôs not possible because RFK Jr. refuses to listen. You can‚Äôt win with a person like that.",zip117,2025-04-15T18:32:52,62

"If someone is right, I don't want them to listen to people who are wrong.  You absolutely can win with a guy like that... If he's correct.  The problem people have with rfk is not that they can't win with ""a person like that*, because again, if he's correct you will win with him... the problem people have with rfk is that they **can't be in charge with a person like that.**  And that, more than anything else, pisses off and scares people who want to subordinate themselves to rule by committee.  The only people worried here are the people who are so scared of responsibility but so envious of authority that they live their lives by the adage that when there's credit to be given everyone should have a share in it, but when there's blame to go around it belongs to one person.",Shadeylark,2025-04-16T06:32:17,3
"""He refuses to listen.  You can't win with a person like that"".  Yeah, how do you deal with someone who won't concede basic concepts?  Like public health figures being authorities on topics?  We see how well the COVID response was handled by all the highly educated authorities.  Perhaps you should reference Fauci's congressional hearings, where he admits under oath and penalty of perjury, he basically just made things up.    There are ways to deal with people who won't concede basic ideas, and that is starting from points of common ground and expanding.  It's called diplomacy and it's something these quacks in public health don't understand because they are too busy sniffing their own farts and serving up freshly cooked data calling it ""evidence"".  The cost of having a high salary and ""job security"" ü§£ is dealing with difficult people in difficult situations.  They don't have to do anything useful or productive, simply show up.  If this guy couldn't do that then he should have been fired before having the option to resign.  That's the only tragedy to this.",Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-04-16T12:57:25,3
"This is exactly right.  In the event he is wrong there are ways to deal with it.  Unfortunately for them, and especially in the aftermath of the COVID debacle, these public health shills have lost the benefit of the doubt of having any clue what they are talking about.  This entire argument reads like the pseudo-intellectuals guide to whining because the other party won't let you start with them on unquestioned high ground.    They earned RFK with the unmitigated disaster they have turned healthcare into in the US.  Higher disease burden than any industrialized country on the planet.  Highest spending on healthcare on the planet.  Worst objective statistical outcomes in the industrialized world.  Then with their abjectly incompetent COVID response they earned RFK gleefully pillaging and burning the system to the ground.  Build a new better one over its ashes.",Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-04-16T13:08:06,3
"I‚Äôm specifically talking about RFK Jr. here. And if you watched his confirmation hearings, you‚Äôd see that serving up freshly cooked data is *exactly* what he tried to do, as he always does. When confronted with a meta-analysis on the safety of the MMR vaccine, he came back with a paper by this guy Anthony Mawson just ‚Äòpublished‚Äô on a Wordpress blog a couple weeks prior. His work has been widely discredited. I did a point-by-point rebuttal of another one of his papers myself for misapplication of basic statistics. But RFK Jr. and his colleagues will continue to flood you with bullshit until they overwhelm your resources. That‚Äôs why you can‚Äôt win with these hardcore conspiracy theorists.",zip117,2025-04-16T13:10:53,4
How about you give point by point breakdowns of how all that was funded?  Since they are so safe there is no need for the Trust Act to exist.  Let's do away with it and default to tort law.    Perhaps all the money in that investment account that was intended to pay out on vaccine injury could paydown the national debt?  Since it never paid any claims anyways there should be a ton of money.     Perhaps had the medical establishment not chosen to lose their credibility with a botched COVID response and the inconsequential fistfight of COVID vaccine authoritarianism they wouldn't be saddled with someone like RFK now.  You think these are two totally unrelated things and they aren't.,Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-04-16T13:29:34,2
