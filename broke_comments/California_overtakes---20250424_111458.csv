"Have you thanked Wyoming, Utah, or Nevada yet?   California imports the most energy in the US by almost a factor of 3. Want to guess where it comes from? Wyoming, Alabama, Illinois, Arizona, West VA are the largest producers and exporters. California imports multiple times what most states even use.   With no exaggeration: North Dakota, West VA, and Pennsylvania power the cities of the East Coast. And Wyoming and Arizona power much of the American southwest.   Water? Well, 25% of that water is from other states - imperial county specifically gets almost all its agriculture water from a river that California doesn't even border. That dam that provides the water was a public works project paid for wh n California was hardly even 5 million people, and the rest of the Southwest was practically an uninhabited desert. Which, let's be clear, it would be if it weren't for the bureau of reclamation damming everything that'll make a lake.   With a little change of perspective, California is the leech on the system, and tossing to middle finger to mother nature.   Implying that the states aren't inseparably connected at just about every level is simply asinine.  Edit: We need only look south of the border to see what the area would be like if it weren't for the major environment-manipulating megaprojects.

He won that election. And he teamed up with Republicans again in 2007.  There was this measure proposed that would have implemented something called question time at the board of supervisors. And I think it did end up getting implemented. But all it really was was the mayor would have to go talk to the board of supervisors every month about policy stuff and like actually talk about it.  And I think it was going to be televised, like people could watch it. And Gavin Newsom was like, no, no, I don't want any part of that. And fucking buddied up with Republicans to throw a big fundraiser to oppose that.  And then all the homelessness stuff. When he was mayor of San Francisco, super duper expanded their anti panhandling laws to include like freeway exits, median strips, things like that. And then, I “don't know if people remember this part, but when the Supreme Court made it essentially illegal to not have a place to sleep, Gavin Newsom was one of the first governors in this country who was like, hell yeah, clear out those homeless encampments.  And now, he's doing actual Trump shit where he's threatening to withhold funding from cities in California if they don't clear out their homeless encampments quick enough for his liking, while offering no solutions for where people are supposed to go. That is Trump and immigration, 100%. It's just a smaller group of people and someone that people perceive as being on the left.  No, he's a fucking Republican. He's a conservative Republican. Yeah.

Neither could get to either if it weren't for infrastructure in my state. We have nowhere near the population to pay for that...so, what happens? The feds subsidize us so we can repair the infrastructure that benefits other states. It only makes sense that other states pay for it - it doesn't economically benefit us at all.   Hell, Wyoming has the most road per capita than any state, and they hardly have 500k people to pay for it.  But if it weren't for those roads, multiple states and urban centers would be going dark.   Remember, a lot of this stuff isn't state built. This stuff was built by the feds, maintenance was given to the states, and standards are in place. I would love nothing more than for my state to give up maintenance of an info structure grid that benefits other states - it's like 1/3 of our budget. But that will collapse multiple systems that others rely on.   You know how Texas is having  power grid issues constantly now? And severe price volatility? That's because they went to their own grid. They silo'd themselves. The feds have done the opposite to ensure that every state has every resource they need.

"Here’s the deal: That claim is a half-truth often thrown around for political effect, but the reality is more nuanced.  Is California the “highest” in welfare per capita?  It depends on how you define “welfare.” If you’re talking about traditional Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), California has historically had a larger share of the nation’s caseload because it has higher benefits and broader eligibility compared to many other states. However, if you include programs like SNAP (food stamps), Medicaid, or housing assistance, the rankings shift — and some red states (like Louisiana, Mississippi, and West Virginia) often top those lists on a per capita basis, especially for SNAP and Medicaid.  Why does California have a high number of welfare recipients?  Simple: it’s the most populous state, and it has some of the highest housing costs and income inequality. Many working people still qualify for aid because wages haven’t kept up with the cost of living. California’s safety net is also intentionally designed to be more accessible than many conservative states, where eligibility rules can be much stricter.  And yes, California is very blue.  It leans heavily liberal on most social policies, and its state government supports a more expansive social safety net. But the idea that “liberal = more welfare” is oversimplified. Many of the poorest states (and highest aid recipients per capita) are actually deep red states with conservative leadership — they just receive a lot of federal aid.  TL;DR:  California does have a large welfare caseload, partly due to its size, high cost of living, and more inclusive policies. But “highest per capita” depends on the program, and several red states are right up there (or higher) on various forms of assistance.",gayporn4mes,2025-04-24T18:07:26,1

"That actually makes total sense, and I appreciate the breakdown. You’re right — infrastructure like that doesn’t recognize state lines, and the benefits flow far beyond the borders where the physical resources or roads sit. It’s a shared system, and without federal support, a lot of it wouldn’t be economically sustainable for the individual states tasked with maintaining it.  I also totally get the frustration of having to shoulder that cost locally when the real benefit is regional or even national. The Wyoming example is a perfect illustration. People forget that someone has to pay to keep those arteries open, and often it’s the folks who live where the infrastructure happens to be — not the ones profiting from the access.  The Texas grid example really drives it home: going solo on critical infrastructure can sound good on paper, until it doesn’t work.  Thanks for laying it out so clearly.

"It’s because you don’t have to prove citizenship to receive benefits. Nor get a license. When Arnold was governor it was impossible for illegals to get licensed or apply for benefits.

"I’m going to push back on that, because honestly, that argument doesn’t hold up.  First, the idea that California’s problems are because people aren’t “proving citizenship” to get benefits is political spin, not fact. The vast majority of social services are accessed by U.S. citizens, not undocumented people. And tying the homeless crisis to immigration is just a distraction from the real issues.  Let’s be clear: the homelessness crisis exploded because of a long history of failed housing policy, mental health system collapse, and lack of affordable options—not because of “safe injection sites” or needle exchanges. People didn’t suddenly become homeless because someone gave them a clean needle. They became homeless because rent outpaced wages, mental health care was gutted, and shelters weren’t built because NIMBYs fight them at every turn.  You mention California wages—but those numbers don’t reflect reality for the vast majority of workers. Yes, tech and union trades pay well. But most people aren’t in tech or in a union. Try talking to teachers, grocery clerks, restaurant workers, gig drivers, or health aides scraping by at $20 an hour while gas is $6 and rent is $2,500 for a one-bedroom. That’s the California story for millions.  As for taxes—yes, California taxes heavily. No argument there. But blaming taxes alone is lazy economics. States like Texas and Florida might brag about no state income tax—but they hit working people harder with property taxes, sales taxes, toll roads, and regressive fees. Meanwhile, their wages are lower, healthcare is worse, and worker protections are weaker.  You want to make it political? Fine. Here’s the politics: this isn’t about red or blue. It’s about whether leadership at any level is willing to actually address root causes instead of scapegoating immigrants and people struggling with addiction.

"Rent isn’t 2500 for a one bedroom though. It’s closer to 1500, which is about the same as the states next to California that have lower wages. I literally just checked Zillow for the average rent on a 1 bedroom  People in California always want to exaggerate the cost of living there to play victim. If you look into property ownership though, yes it’ll be higher. But thats because the location, it’s close to the ocean and anything close to an ocean is going to cost you more. The further you get from the ocean the prices will drop. But places like Nevada, Colorado and Utah are only 40-50k lower. The wages there are also lower.  Cities like San Francisco have had $25/hr minimum wage for a while. People that rely on jobs meant for teenagers, college students, and disabled people to make a living though you can’t blame them for not making it. Also don’t bring up teachers, my father in law is a teacher in Santa Rosa and makes $100k/year and has an entire summer break. An ex girlfriend is making $95/ yr in San Jose.  Unless you’re working at a gas station or fast food you’re just fine. And as I said, learning programming is free so people that don’t want to improve their skills for a higher paying job can only complain and blame a system they claim is rigged against them. Trade unions only ask for a high school education and that’s it. The only ones struggling are the ones that choose not to improve their situations.   And no one blamed undocumented people and drug addicts, I simply pointed out the governor there allowed that to happen and it didn’t improve the states deficit, only made it worse…. It isn’t an opinion it’s literally documented fact. I went to college in California during the times before covid and watched it happen. After Covid it became even worse. I’m not even disagreeing that California is in shambles im literally trashing the place for having a huge economy and not having anything to show for it. How can you be the 4th largest economy and have all of these issues? Not investing back into the states issues. Road conditions are garbage, the homeless are on every corner and have mini communities in every city, not to mention the drug issues where there’s methadone clinics every 5 miles.   It’s as if you just want to argue for the sake of arguing. But what else is new with people that blame republicans for every issue. Like honestly it’s not one political party, the whole government system is rigged to fool people just like you into directing hate outwards.

Porn addicts can’t lift their eyes long enough to read up on anything just watch government controlled media outlets that perpetuate “other party” hatred.

There are millions of service workers, caregivers, janitors, restaurant staff, retail employees, and others who aren’t pulling six figures and still face the same high costs for food, gas, utilities, and basic survival.  Saying “just learn to code” or “get into a trade” ignores the structural barriers a lot of people face—including access to training, time, child care, and mental health support. It also assumes that every person’s value is tied to their ability to upskill into whatever job you personally respect.
