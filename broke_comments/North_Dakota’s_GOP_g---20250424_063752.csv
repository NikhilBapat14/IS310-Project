Wow this governor is really pointing out that vouchers don't actually create school choice. Finally a republican admits the truth.,Faucet860,2025-04-24T06:42:16,126
Well that's something I didn't expect a Republican to do. Props to him. Credit where it's due,Miserable_Natural,2025-04-24T07:33:13,44

"If you’re banning books, start with religious texts, they are some of the most hate filled, pornagraphic filth ever written and have caused more harm than any other written word in history.",NoLie129,2025-04-24T09:49:38,8
Any governor that values their budget would reject school choice vouchers.,Traditional-Level-96,2025-04-24T07:55:39,10
N. Dakota's governor is smarter than mine.  FML,ensignlee,2025-04-24T12:07:22,5
Most of ND is rural. Vouchers kill rural education. Glad he got his tongue off of the wing tips long enough to see it.,FritoPendejo1,2025-04-24T12:07:50,3
hell yeah Mr Armstrong,lskerlkse,2025-04-24T10:52:56,2
"Very happy that this Gop governor doesn't betray the US Constitution, and is protecting the rights of association, right to read, free expression, and constitutionally protected speech. Rare W, but credit where credit is due.",Ging287,2025-04-24T11:28:08,2
It’s due to rural areas and how it would impact them. Since the Dakota’s are heavily rural. Same reason Texas kept saying no.. until recently,BumpinBakes,2025-04-24T12:20:03,1
"I'm at the wow stage too. So he actually looked at how it affected other states and said nope.  Amazing.  He must not be a Christian Nationalist like my gov, Reynolds. Our school vouchers are set to spend a half billion a year since there are zero income restrictions to claiming the voucher.",dirttraveler,2025-04-24T07:07:48,52
Hell yes! I feel like legislators pushing for “school choice” intentionally mislead low income folks to steal their school dollars to get themselves a discount for their kids’ private schools with 5 figure+ annual tuition and strict admittance policies,beadzy,2025-04-24T15:11:04,2
Republicans at the state level are hit and miss. A lot of them bend the knee but some of them understand that winning state level elections typically requires some concessions being made.,AdmiralRon,2025-04-24T07:37:47,19
"Well… to be fair, Greg Abbott is a founding member of the Axis of Apathy",indycishun1996,2025-04-24T12:17:27,3
"Not ours. He bent down on both knees. His entire legislative wish list this year was a litany of legislative bigotry, the worst of which passed.",angmarsilar,2025-04-24T09:36:42,1
