He campaigned in all three elections like he was a 'heel' in professional wrestling.  Essentially you go out and explain a bunch of grievances that are mostly lies but are sprinkled with a hint of truth. Then the 'face' comes along and tries to explain how the heel is wrong but has to admit that he is a little bit right. But by then it doesn't matter as the heel is onto his next set of grievances.  Ultimately it gives the impression that the heel knows what he's talking about as he says his thing with confidence and the face is always stumbling along playing catch up. The content of what is said doesn't matter at all. It's all about non-verbal language.,Purify5,2025-04-24T10:43:37,6
He was **IN** a pro wrestling match. I am not kidding.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkghtyxZ6rc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkghtyxZ6rc),Bruce-7891,2025-04-24T10:25:39,2

"There is an actual name for this! Its called kayfabe, and came from professional wrestling. When I learned about the history and how it is used, and how its tied to Vince McMahon the sky opened up! ""Maintaining the suspension of disbelief"" is the name of the game.",katiescasey,2025-04-24T13:11:26,2

"He's in the WWE Hall of Fame.  He's somehow not the worst person to sell a Stone Cold Stunner, though!   He's got that going for him!  (Our secretary of education set that bar impossibly low.  Yes, this gets dumber the more you think about it, and that's saying something).",obligatorythr0waway,2025-04-24T10:41:32,3
"Yup, you're totally right! We touch on that a bit in our piece:  >Central to the concept of professional wrestling is the practice of kayfabe, or committing to the illusion that clearly staged events are real and true. It’s a narrative device that asks audiences to suspend their disbelief, not in a way of passive acceptance, but rather active participation in the creation of what is possible.",19thnews,2025-04-24T13:13:57,3
"I loved the NY Times article by Abe Riesman on kayfabe, how the fakeness is never acknowledged. The parallels to politics going back to Rome is astounding. It's almost as if politics evolved into kayfabe wrestling tropes, and back into politics again through pop culture. We need to find a way to ""wink"" at the fiction just enough to destroy it, ""Political Entertainment"" Vs. actual government.",katiescasey,2025-04-24T13:21:29,2
