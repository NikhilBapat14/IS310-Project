"Well for starters here's a list of natural alternatives that are already commonly used in Europe in place of these petroleum-based synthetic dyes:  Natural Alternatives:  1. **Annatto** (E160b): A reddish-orange dye made from the seeds of the achiote tree.  1. **Beetroot**: Used for its red and pink coloring.  1. **Turmeric** (E100): Provides a yellow color.  1. **Spirulina**: A blue-green pigment from algae.  1. **Elderberry juice** (E163): Used for its red and purple hues.  1. **Paprika** (E160c): Provides a red-orange color.  1. **Lycopene** (E160d): Found in tomatoes and provides a red color.  1. **Chlorophyll**: A green pigment found in plants.  1. **Anthocyanins**: Found in red cabbages, raspberries, and beetroots, providing violet, blue, and red colors.  1. **Carotenoids**: Found in tomatoes, carrots, and apricots, providing red, orange, and yellow colors.   So I'm guessing some combination of these will achieve a similar neon-green color that you're used to? It may not be as fluorescent but it'll be close enough",Tiaan,2025-04-22T17:13:52,-2

"You cannot mix any of those to get a neon green, and all of those have a higher risk of allergic reactions than synthetic food safe dyes. On top of that, the general stability and lightfastness is superior with synthetic food dyes. Being synthesized from petroleum isn’t that bad. Our modern society requires petroleum to function, so the byproducts will either accumulate somewhere, or they can get used for other things. If we’re going to refine petroleum, I’d prefer the byproducts get used for something. Not to mention, there’s a huge case for personal choice—we don’t ban cigarettes which are known to cause cancer, we let people make informed choices about what they put into their bodies. It’s the job of a parent to ensure their children don’t consume things they don’t want—you shouldn’t need the government to over regulate something that are generally considered safe for most people.",W0RZ0NE,2025-04-22T17:28:33,2

"""Dude... it's just like, common sense man.""  Listen bro, if you want to pretend keeping prices low is bad you can but you are actually a goofball saying this shit. Do you acknowledge that if artificial dyes are banned companies will use other alternatives instead of just removing the dyes? How do we know THOSE are safe? ""Natural"" stuff is way more complicated and has way more variables to control for.  If we were to ban all food coloring (not possible) maybe that would be good but that literally wouldn't happen.  The current research concludes certain people have an allergic reaction to food dyes that may exacerbate ADHD symptoms and that's about all they could find.

"They will always add coloring to food because it increases sales. Be serious.  ""people could tell smoking was bad before human trials"" What? We've known smoking was bad since the 1950s. Before then nobody really had any clue (good luck proving the contrary)  If anything before it was known to be carcinogenic there was probably reason to believe it was neutral or even **good** because nicotine on its own is a nootropic with cognitive enhancing properties, I'm certain many people thought it was good when it not only makes you feel smarter but objectively makes you score higher on cognitive assessments being on nicotine.",AyimaPetalFlower,2025-04-23T09:08:44,2

"Completely agree with you - at the end of the day people can make it a health issue, political issue, but it's going to be a money issue. Companies will never take food coloring out because even SOME people will not buy gray fish or piss yellow Doritos and instead they will create more harmful shit that is just as cheap or increase prices when they use slightly more expensive dyes that could be equally harmful (which we don't know since scientific evidence is sparse). I think it's a great change in a world where FDA is funded and remotely impartial, universities studying food science are well funded to research more, and government isn't imposing massive inflationary policies on top of this.

They have a history of regulation, why wouldn’t we simply require more visible disclosures on products containing food dye? Why ban it?

Where would all these now-orphaned children be placed? How would you split up the families?
