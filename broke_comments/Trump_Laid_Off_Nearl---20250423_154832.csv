The firefighters union didn’t endorse a candidate so Trump probably took that as a slight and wanted to punish them.,angrypooka,2025-04-23T16:05:30,22

">      Snippet:  >The cuts, which are part of Trump’s slashing of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, will also halt a first-of-its-kind study of the causes of thousands of firefighters’ cancer cases.  >When a firefighter dies in the line of duty, a small team of federal health workers is often called on to pinpoint what went wrong and identify how to avoid similar accidents in the future.  >That’s what happened after [two firefighters died](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/firefighters/programs/pdfs/face202010.pdf) in California in 2020 while searching for an elderly woman in a burning library. It happened in 2023 when [a Navy firefighter died](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/firefighters/programs/pdfs/face202309.pdf) in Maryland after a floor collapsed in a burning home.   >And it happened last year in Georgia when [a career battalion chief died](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/firefighters/programs/pdfs/face202405.pdf) after a semitrailer truck exploded.  >But President Donald Trump’s administration has taken steps to fire nearly all of the Department of Health and Human Services employees responsible for conducting those reviews.  >[At least two-thirds of the employees at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/06/health/cdc-niosh-cuts-safety/index.html), an agency within HHS, were notified on April 1 that they had been laid off or will be in June. These cuts included seven of the eight members of the Fire Fighter Fatality Investigation and Prevention Program, the team that studies firefighter line-of-duty deaths, one of the laid-off investigators told ProPublica.  >Most nonunionized NIOSH workers were given until the end of the day to clear out their desks.

"Firefighters die at a 14% higher rate from cancer than the average American. A study to determine the reasons will be slashed/canceled by Trump. Americans in general overwhelmingly support Firefighters. That said, the Firefighters' union did not endorse a presidential candidate so I guess this is Trump being a little btch again.",Psychicgoat2,2025-04-23T16:49:31,4

"For years into the future,  every graph, every trendline, every table of statistics from the important to the banal will have an asterisk saying “reliable data not available” for a huge swath of time starting in 2025.

>“reliable data not available”   It's infuriating!! I just read someone asking how much Trump saved in the past (100 days?) and there's NO way of knowing as we know DOGE/MUSK has made up a lot of their supposed data🙄,Silent-Resort-3076,2025-04-24T07:41:09,2
"Not leaving a trail and deleting all your activity logs (as Musk did with his vandalizing and theft of NTSB data) is part of the plan.   Forensics and historians are going to be tearing their hair out for decades.   The true vacuum of reliable facts will probably turn this whole chapter of US history into a pseudo historical myth like the overlapping conspiracies around JFK, but 100x bigger.",mjc4y,2025-04-24T08:07:24,2
