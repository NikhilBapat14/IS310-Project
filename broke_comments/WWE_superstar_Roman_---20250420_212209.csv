"It's so funny how the IWC (internet wrestling community) is handling this. Roman is so popular right now. But now people want to hate him over this, which is bullshit. Same thing happened when Undertaker and Kane openly endorsed Trump too.",AndForeverNow,2025-04-21T02:01:40,38

"It’s funny, they were beloved as “smart and great guys” before becoming political, and as soon as they did, all of a sudden, we’re supposed to believe they are nasty people. Just shows how fickle fans are.  Just look at Undertaker and how much shit he gets with everything he says or does now after getting to be himself and not a character. That he uses his influence to get his wife in the Hall of Fame, that he does this or does that. It’s absurd.",Sir_Netflix,2025-04-21T07:16:31,9

"And at the same time the left tries so hard to make it out to be some “white trashy sport”, not at all considering the billions it takes in annually, and the sheer size of its fanbase, which goes well beyond “white people”.",ITrCool,2025-04-20T22:00:30,24
I think all of the Trump supporters can now safely come out in the open without worrying too much about retribution from the looney left.,Ironman650,2025-04-20T22:13:02,15

I think wrestling and sports in general are safer to be openly conservative because you see in real time the effects. ,mattcruise,2025-04-20T22:30:58,11
