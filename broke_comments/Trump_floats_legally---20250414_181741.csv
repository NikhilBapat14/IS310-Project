"Per Google AI (Gemini):   Me: Hypothetically, if the US president “deported” a US citizen…wouldn’t that be similar to human trafficking since the the US is in fact his home country?  AI: That’s a really interesting and complex hypothetical scenario! Here’s a breakdown of why that action would be legally problematic and why the comparison to human trafficking, while thought-provoking, isn’t a direct fi.  Why “Deporting” a US Citizen is Legally Impossible:  * Citizenship Rights: The US Constitution guarantees fundamental rights to its citizens, including the right to due process and the right to remain in their country. There are no legal grounds or mechanisms in the US to “deport” a citizen. Deportation is a process specifically for foreign nationals who have violated immigration laws.  * Fourteenth Amendment: The Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution defines citizenship and includes the Citizenship Clause, which states that all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to its jurisdiction are citizens of the United States. This firmly establishes the right of citizens to their country.  * Lack of Legal Framework: There are no laws in the United States that authorize the president or any government entity to strip a person of their citizenship and then deport them, except in very specific and limited circumstances (like fraudulently obtaining citizenship), and even those are subject to due process and legal challenges.  Why the Comparison to Human Trafficking is Not a Direct Fit:  While the idea of forcibly moving someone against their will from their home country might evoke the injustice of human trafficking, the legal definitions and underlying motivations differ significantly:  * Human Trafficking Definition: Human trafficking, as defined under US and international law, generally involves the exploitation of individuals for profit through force, fraud, or coercion. This often includes the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or commercial sex acts. The key element is exploitation.  * Hypothetical “Deportation”: The hypothetical scenario you describe involves the government acting against its own citizen. While it would be a severe violation of that citizen’s rights and potentially involve coercion and forced movement, the primary motivation wouldn’t necessarily be the exploitative profit motive that is central to human trafficking.  However, the Hypothetical Raises Serious Concerns:  Even though it wouldn’t legally be “deportation” or technically “human trafficking” as defined, the act of a US president forcibly removing a US citizen from the country would be:  * A grave violation of constitutional rights.  * An illegal and likely impeachable offense.  * Comparable to forced exile, which is a serious human rights violation.  In conclusion, while the image of forcibly removing someone from their home country shares a disturbing similarity with the movement of people in human trafficking, the legal framework and definitions make them distinct. The hypothetical action you describe would be an unprecedented and unconstitutional act against a US citizen.”  Edit: Formatting",dontsitonmyface174,2025-04-14T19:54:56,1

"I’m not even sure unconstitutional fully covers the severity of it. It’s unconscionable, and an atrocious abuse of power so egregious, that very few world leaders in history have seen it pan out positively for their regime.
