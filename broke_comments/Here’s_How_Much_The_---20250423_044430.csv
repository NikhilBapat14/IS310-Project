"Men are severely underrepresented in the nursing field, but it seems they're not considered an underrepresented minority if they're white or Asian.  This seems incredibly racist.",AMW1234,2025-04-23T10:53:50,23
It‚Äôs interesting that Asians are often included with whites in these DEI programs.,dryginmartiniwolives,2025-04-23T06:13:29,16
"Setting aside that we shouldn't be doing this... The idea we have to spend money to get more 'pacific islander' nurses, when Filipina nurses are a huge source of the best talent and continues to grow without any effort, is comical.",Unlucky-Prize,2025-04-23T13:31:05,6
"Only 14% of the population is black. Unless you‚Äôre in a predominantly black area like Atlanta, you‚Äôre not going to see a huge uptick in black nurses. It‚Äôs not possible. This is all stupid.",yelloh-berry,2025-04-23T07:07:39,13

"Dems practice every wrongdoing they accuse, it's all just projection and illusions. People living in total misery in Dem territory keep voting Dem because their overlords have convinced them that everything they experience is the other side's fault somehow.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-23T10:37:00,20
It is racist,XXXCincinnatusXXX,2025-04-23T12:29:25,16
They only count as POC to leftists when it‚Äôs convenient for a leftist narrative.,skarface6,2025-04-23T09:36:03,19
"""We need to spend more because we can't get enough XYZ in the ABC place"" - all that spent money is paid to somebody. It's all just another jackpot for connected people at the expense of taxpayers.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-23T10:39:32,12
