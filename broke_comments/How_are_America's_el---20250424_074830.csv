"America's universities are an investment in the country's future.  Being humans don't live forever you have to refresh the capability in perpetuity.   Anyone who thinks that universities are purely self funded for profit are missing the much larger picture.  This is what Trump and right wingers are trying to kill.  The country will not suffer immediately, but in 1 or 2 years the slope will be so steep down that we will fail in a decade.",TintedApostle,2025-04-24T08:05:38,8
Our higher education is among the best in the world... and now Trump wants to destroy it because he doesn't like anyone who is smarter than him.,AnteaterPositive6939,2025-04-24T08:09:08,5
"Can they survive without federal government aid?  I think they can, and will, survive. Changes in the business model will be inevitable, though - as universities will have to extract vastly higher payments from businesses (Pharma, Electronics, medicine, military) for the research which they've hitherto been sponging off of as long as the government has been funding applied and basic research. They (businesses) were able to do this since the government funding was ostensibly targeted toward ""the public good,"" allowing business to profit off of those activities, often at no cost to themselves other than to hire the graduates who made the research possible. Now, presuming trump's disdain for education and research continues to fester, the businesses will have to pay full costs, and will lock the discoveries they will have paid for - to keep the resulting profits within their commercial bubbles - never to escape into the ""public good.""  I'm quite sure this is exactly what MAGA means by GREAT.",phosdick,2025-04-24T08:12:34,0

They're basically REITs which fill the property with students seeking pieces of paper.,whatareyousomekinda,2025-04-24T07:56:58,0
"As Scott Galloway has discussed, many of the largest endowment schools are hedge funds offering classes.  The repercussions of cutting government education aid will be profound in many ways.",Smithy2232,2025-04-24T07:54:22,-2

The universities in general have been unaffected outsidenof those doing research. Much of the federal funding goes to research grants and in alot of cases it has to do with diseases/medical.,Ok-Gear-5593,2025-04-24T08:02:27,-2

"That is a gross oversimplification of what is going on.  Harvard didn't choose to create an endowment to become a hedge fund corporation. Poeple donated money, the principle is invested and the returns are used to provide scholarships and fund operations.  If you give an insitution $100 dollars, they could spend the $100 on paper one time or invest it and use the returns to buy paper in perpetuity.  This funding model has grown in popularity because of the state and federal government's decreasing investment in higher education. Donor's are encouraged to agree to an investment endowment instead fo straight cash for a specific purpose for this very reason. The money goes much farter, much longer.",olidus,2025-04-24T08:01:23,6
"Except there's no going back really. That world lacked any real competition. Where it did emerge, in the past century, it was subjugated. WW2 has been over for a long time, the world is just different now.Â    The US could probably only produce fascism at the end, in aggregate that's mostly what it produced in one form or another, in different places at different times.",whatareyousomekinda,2025-04-24T08:04:23,0
