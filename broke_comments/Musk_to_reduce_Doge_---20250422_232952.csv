"It is so weird that people can see through the 'businessman' persona of Musk but not Trump.  Two guys given millions, excellent at inventing things that already exist but can't profit from them, with no love for their country or the Constitution.",Weak-Regular7772,2025-04-22T23:33:55,28

"Elon Musk is stepping back from his role with DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) to refocus on Tesla, after a 71% drop in the company’s profits and backlash over his political ties. This has nothing to do with Dogecoin.",zakra11,2025-04-22T23:33:52,2

"Fucker can try, but Tesla is rightfully fucked unless he divests from the company and steps down as it's CEO.

As if reducing his DOEG (Department of Elon's Gripes) role will undo any of the damage he's already caused. Good riddance.,climactivated,2025-04-23T00:12:00,1
"The irony being that in his role as head of DOGE he has publicly shown that the success of Tesla and SpaceX are in no way the result of his talents but rather his complete disregard for factually truth, the law, expertise and the well-being of anyone who isn’t Elon Musk.  Much like with the USG, I can’t imagine the efficiency of any of his companies with be improved by having more of his attention.",vgaph,2025-04-23T04:55:00,1

"The higher you rise, the further you fall.  A lot of people respected Musk in the same way they respected Thomas Edison: he might be a thief and an abuser, who built his empire on the backs of others and stole their credit, but at least he got impressive achievements for his companies, and moved a lot of technology forward. It's the kind of strength certain people respect, even if unfairly earned. You know, the ""he's a rough cop, but he gets results"" kind of respect.  Meanwhile, Trump didn't even do that: he just took his daddy's money and burned it. Trump doesn't have a single legacy policy or achievement under his belt. Demagoguery is his only public skill, and he's not intelligent enough to even have the grasp of a coherent political agenda. Trump is not a ""bad cop who gets results"", he's a bad cop that beats up innocents who aren't even suspects, all while failing to solve a single crime. Even the ""tough on crime"" crowd doesn't respect that kind of cop.  Many people you see angry at Musk on Reddit, don't truly ""hate"" Trump, the same way you can't hate a steaming pile of shit you stepped into. Because you can't truly hate something that doesn't have agency. You just wipe your foot and move on. Trump is a narcissistic moron acting like a narcissistic moron, end of story. Expecting him to act otherwise is like expecting a snake not to bite, or a wasp not to sting.  Musk, though, is different. While he is not the genius his fans portray, he *is* intelligent enough to be fully aware of his own actions and their consequences on others. This makes his recent actions much more of a true betrayal for many, worthy of true hate. The things Musk had said and done turned him from a second Thomas Edison to a second Henry Ford, and while both of them did bad things, the latter, being an open Nazi sympathizer, was objectively more evil. Even in today's polarized America, there are still a lot of people who are OK with a ruthless industrialist, but *not* OK with a Nazi.",GeneReddit123,2025-04-22T23:40:25,9

"I hate both of these guys, but Musk is a legit businessman while Trump is just a cosplay businessman. Doesn't mean Elon isn't a sociopathic POS, but he is the richest man in the world and has a few significant/growing companies - which technically makes him a successful businessman.  But we shouldn't have a businessman shape the country, because empathy is an important quality that many successful businesspeople lack.",BizzyHaze,2025-04-23T03:06:32,-1

"Genuinely for the benefit of both Musk and Tesla, he should sell off all Tesla shares, and focus on SpaceX and Neuralink. As you mentioned, the kind of people who like Teslas don't like what Musk has been doing. Like, at all.  On the other hand, the kind of people who support unethical medical experiments, or who care [when rockets come up, but not where they come down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEJ9HrZq7Ro), will be perfectly happy with someone like Musk at the helm.",GeneReddit123,2025-04-23T00:46:14,2
"Can believe any one can claim the Elon is a Business man, he’s and opportunist.  all his previous “moonshots” were fully based on other people’s ideas, work and sweet.  He has completely shown with his DOGE and Pro Trump antics that he was never the sharpest knife in the drawer. he fully televised that he Could control the Donald, and that no one would blame him for the shitstorm that the Turdreich has gifted the world. especially when he Tried to suggest that everything was based on his involvement and tried so hard to position himself always that he is showing the way  Now that is become apparent that all those savings on “billion and billions of dollars of savings that he was promoting just a few weeks ago can and could never be achieved, he’s all out to blame everyone else,  this is just another failure like the boaring company except for how he managed to get billions of dollars in government contracts and awards, whilst wearing the whole economy of the United States in part by forcing the closure of so many institutions and regulatory bodies that allowed the world to trust the US  I also believe that trust in the whole Musk empire has been screwed single handedly by Musk himself and not quite sure what if anything he can do to save companies like Tesla.. well except a full exit before it’s to late and allow the adults in the room to pick up the parts and march on",nobackup42,2025-04-23T04:54:46,1
