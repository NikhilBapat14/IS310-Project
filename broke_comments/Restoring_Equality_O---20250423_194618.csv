But that's not what equity programs have done universally. A good example is specialized HS's in NYC. the Cantonese immigrant community is among the poorest ethnic group in NYC. Yet they have some of the most phenomenal outcomes and rises out of poverty due to hard work. The parents will be cooks at a Chinese restaurant and still manage to push their kids to do so good to get into a specialized HS.   So the city said we have to many Asians and Whites. A few years ago they tried to use equity to remedy the demographic disparity. So what did they do? The complain was that the Asian students were just doing too good on tests to get in. The Asian students are known to study very hard and go to test prep centers religiously.  So the test was seen as the issue by the government and they opened up enrollment. Hoping to equalize the chances for all students.   Well they did equalize things but the outcomes didn't work out. Some students did fine but most didn't. So eventually they backtracked the changes and went back to the test being the sole decider.   In this case equity was used to get the outcome they wanted. They opened up the admissions process and favored characteristics certain students who were bookworms didn't have. They did get what they wanted which was a demographic shift. But the outcome didn't work out.   But is this really equality? Those booksmart Asian kids had been setup to fail. They either did so amazing on the test to.make up for their lacking social skills or they just didn't get in. Now of course there are plenty of socially apt Asian students. But the the admissions process was specifically designed to get a specific result.   To me that doesn't sound like equality. The entire purpose of the specialized HS's is to be magnet schools for advanced study and academic excellence. It sounds like a hurdle was put up for certain students in favor of others. That's not equality.   Equality would have been we want to change the demographics. We see these Asian families really struggling and pushing with after school tutoring and studying. We should have for free a program for all students who want this tutoring from teachers who we will pay overtime to. This way you alleviate the Asian families and all other people can get the same benefit. But no that would be too much. They had to sacrifice some to help others. That's what some of these programs end up as.,pickledplumber,2025-04-23T20:14:50,-15

"Equality is a wide open door atop a set of stairs, giving the initial impression that anyone can enter. The door is the same for everyone.   Equity is providing a ramp so people can enter even if they can't use the stairs. The door isn't the issue, the issue is that not everyone has the same access to the door due to differing abilities.   Obviously we need both. The door needs to be open to all AND we need to account for and eliminate disparities in access. People in poverty sometimes require more help and support to achieve the same successes that affluent people are able to achieve. Kids with learning disabilities may need additional assistance or accommodations that kids without learning disabilities do not. Elimination of those barriers to success (the aforementioned ramp) is equity. And then everyone deserves the same equal shot at a job or a scholarship or whatever (the aforementioned door) regardless of whether they're a female or a Muslim or Black or Deaf. That's equality.   MAGA doesn't want either of those things. MAGA is a bouncer at the open door denying entry to anyone who isn't white and wearing a polo, khakis and boat shoes.",Frickin_Brat,2025-04-23T23:54:04,3

You don't even know the case I'm talking about and are talking generally. You're trying to misrepresent my argument. It's a straw man  So if lets say an equity program favored lifesaving COVID treatment for African Americans over White patients in a hospital setting. Irregardless of severity of sickness. Would that be a program that benefits everybody?  Because that happened in NYC during COVID. People died who didn't need to.,pickledplumber,2025-04-23T20:43:10,-7
"That's all fine. Nothing wrong with the ramp. That's good. The reason people get wound up about equity is because instead of just putting the ramp, in certain cases  you want to put a slip and slide for certain people on part of the stairs  I'm not even talking about  privileged people feeling discriminated against when there are corrections in place.",pickledplumber,2025-04-24T10:16:59,0
