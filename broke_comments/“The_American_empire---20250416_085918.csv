"I lived in Dearborn Heights from 96 - 2005. The shit that has gone on in Dearborn even back then. Too many of our enemies are willing to play the long game and we seem to be short sighted too many times to look at that.  The United States is not 4 year terms, it is an ongoing beautiful experience of Freedom and Liberty. These problems have been planned and orchestrated for decades.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-16T10:55:20,62
That dumbass standing next to him in the video. Does she know what will happen to her if the ‚Äúempire‚Äù falls?  Using violence to get your way‚Ä¶ Hm‚Ä¶ Where have I seen that before? ü§î No wonder the left and these terrorists get along so well.,rdenghel,2025-04-16T09:27:38,82

"This seems like clear domestic terrorism from folks who should not have been here in the first place. If they are immigrants, now citizens, they have taken the Oath, so if they are known to be out of compliance with their Oath, they must have their citizenship revoked, as well as the citizenship of anyone they sponsored and all of their anchor children as well. Then deport.",obscurityknocks,2025-04-17T09:10:20,3
