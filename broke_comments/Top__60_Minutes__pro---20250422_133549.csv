"I really really hope this isn't related to the $20 billion lawsuit from Trump to CBS. It has no grounds and is a frivolous lawsuit. If we find out soon that CBS settles, Bill Owens quitting now is probably due to that and he knew he didn't want to be involved with CBS anymore because of it.",BureMakutte,2025-04-22T13:43:08,30
"*""Over the past months, it has also become clear that I would not be allowed to run the show as I have always run it.... After defending the show ""from every angle, over time with everything I could,"" he has elected to step aside.*  This sounds interesting, but because of the paywall, I'm not sure of the context of Owen's resignation.",fxkatt,2025-04-22T13:58:19,8

"> It's not frivolous, it's bad journalism to run an unrelated clip as an answer to a question. Regardless of the bias at play, that alone is unethical. Add in the fact that it was done pretty ham fistedly to pump Kamala's image, and you've got a recipe for a lawsuit.   There it is. ""unrelated clip"". Sorry dude but you need to research this better. Nowhere was there a ""unrelated clip as an answer to a question"". All clips used were related to the question at hand. The promo used a 1 portion of the answer to the question, and the interview used a different portion. They also shortened another answer. Should they have edited? maybe not. But at what point do you go from editing for time to editing for making them ""look good"". If Trump or Kamala rambled on for hours, would they have to not edit it and play it in its entirety?  https://reason.com/2025/02/06/trump-is-flat-out-lying-about-the-60-minutes-interview-with-harris/  Trumps lawsuit is bullshit and anyone with a brain knows it. He's just trying to strong arm CBS because thats what he does.  Also isn't this technically an attack on freedom of the press? Do you think Fox News never edits their interviews?",BureMakutte,2025-04-22T14:08:47,25

"> lack of integrity at 60 minutes.  60 minutes edits every interview they post for all time.   When Trump ran in 2016 he got into an argument with 60 minutes because he argued they edit him poorly. So he had his own people film the interview and then released the entire thing unedited on his website before it actually aired. In 2020, he walked out of his 60 minutes interview after being asked a question about COVID.   This whole lawsuit is a decades long pissing match between Trump and 60 minutes. If they settle its because they think it will get Trump off their dick and not dig into their merger with Skydance.  There is no validity to the lawsuit what so ever.",kanst,2025-04-22T17:23:57,1

">If it's as simple as editing for time, CBS wouldn't be considering settling to the point where the showrunner is now leaving. If it were edited for time and nothing else, that would be remarkably easy to show in court.  >Sure, strongarming happens, but it's not cheaper for CBS to settle for a multi million dollar claim than it is to take it to court against Trump's pretty shitty law team. That should tell you a lot.  This is a weird thought process.   Completely ignoring how CBS would be settling not just because of the show, but because of .. i dunno... the fascist regime and corruption hes showing? Do you not study history and how during the rise of Nazism, tons of companies appeased Hitler? Why did they release all the transcripts and everything to prove the liar that DJT is?  Funny enough you never actually rebutted my evidence, you just claimed because CBS might be kowtowing to Trump, he must be right. That is some authoritarian thinking there bud.  https://www.npr.org/2025/04/22/nx-s1-5372733/60-minutes-bill-owens-cbs-trump-paramount  Yep, the network is bowing down to fascism.  https://www.commondreams.org/news/trump-corporations-inauguration  Explain to me how $20 Billion is a valid suit. 20 BILLION, for editing a couple of segments in reducing the air time.",BureMakutte,2025-04-22T15:46:07,2
