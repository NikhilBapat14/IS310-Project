"Still trying to understand how we are supposed to take anyone who wants to come in but if we go to say even Mexico this is what happens.  People who enter Mexico illegally are subject to penalties under Mexican law. According to Article 123 of the General Law of Population, a foreigner who enters Mexico illegally can face a penalty of up to two years in prison and a fine of three hundred to five hundred thousand pesos.  Entering Iran illegally can result in severe penalties, including fines, imprisonment, and in some cases, flogging or other forms of corporal punishment.  People who enter Saudi Arabia illegally face severe penalties. They can be fined up to 100,000 Saudi riyals (approximately US$26,635) and jailed for up to one year, with deportation upon release. For repeat offenses, the fines and imprisonment terms increase. Additionally, individuals who employ or aid foreigners without proper visas can face fines of 15,000 to 100,000 riyals, imprisonment for up to six months, and deportation.  BUT, we give them free housing, preferential treatment, money and more.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-23T12:27:48,76
"But, but the Dens in the US told us it wasnt so...  surely, all the data from europe having large rises in crime CANT be due to all their mass migration...  say it aint so...",_Vardos_,2025-04-23T12:27:43,25
"The UK as well as most of Europe has committed cultural suicide and I fear it's too late for them. It's not like those in Germany can now round them up, hold them in camps and ship them out.   The only hope is to STOP now and let the current ones die off.   Of course I only mean those who hate every part of Western civilization, want it destroyed, commit crimes and refuse to be part of society.   There are more than enough immigrants who would appreciate being there.",Key-Monk6159,2025-04-23T12:50:41,33
Just re-looking at the penalties for illegal entry in Saudi Arabia.  The last part I think should be mandatory.  Upon release from Prison... IMMEDIATE DEPORTATION,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-23T13:17:32,12

To no one’s surprise! The ordinary folk knew this all along way before this was ever published.,Royal_IDunno,2025-04-23T15:13:24,7

The massive difference is that those coming from Mexico and South America at least mostly share our Western values and traditions.   There are obviously some exceptions but it's exactly opposite of those coming from the Middle East.,Key-Monk6159,2025-04-23T13:53:33,21
"Anyone can come here through Mexico and South America if our border is open. They caught a bunch of people from China making the crossing. Also, a lot of Arabs. There are no guarantees.",JackNoir1115,2025-04-23T19:05:37,14
Seems like they embrace LIBERAL values when they come here illegally.,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-23T13:57:43,12
I think we can all agree on that. But the vast majority holds true for both locations.,Key-Monk6159,2025-04-23T19:09:01,-1
"It certainly matters where people are from, yes.  There is zero acceptable illegal immigration, but our legal immigration policy can reflect this.",JackNoir1115,2025-04-23T19:11:44,5
Yep. But in Europe they mostly let them in 'legally'. They did this to themselves under the guise of compassion.,Key-Monk6159,2025-04-23T19:14:32,5
