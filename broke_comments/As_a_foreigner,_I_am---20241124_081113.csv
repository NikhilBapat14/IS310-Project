This article covers it. The same people passing voter ID laws are simultaneously making it harder for certain people to get IDs.

"Generally you can only get an ‘acceptable’ Photo ID from a specific government office, which is only open during bank hours and can be quite inaccessible (remember that the US is huge, I’m pretty sure that there are _counties_ that are the size of some European _countries_, and there might be a single office for the entire county, and there’s not much in the way of public transportation to get there).   So in order to get the ID there are classes of people (generally lower income) who have to take a day off of work (and forgo the income), transport themselves to the office, and pay a fee that could be another half day’s wages to get the ID. A non-zero number of people won’t bother, which means their votes would be suppressed.  If voter fraud were an issue that might still be worth it, but considering that we’re talking like [500 cases of fraud out of 100,000,000’s of votes cast](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/11/nx-s1-5147732/voter-fraud-explainer) (and some of THOSE are things that ID wouldn’t stop, like voting in multiple jurisdictions, or voting as a felon) the cure is worse than the disease.",uencos,2024-11-24T11:05:58,59
"The LWV gives a good example here:   [https://www.lwv.org/blog/whats-so-bad-about-voter-id-laws](https://www.lwv.org/blog/whats-so-bad-about-voter-id-laws)      There's a few issues:   1. Government issued photo IDs are not given out freely. Young voters who live in cities or on school campuses often don't have need to get a photo ID, so there's no point in applying for one. If you don't need to drive anywhere, you don't need to get a license. And if you're not planning to leave the country, you don't need a passport.   Similarly, these forms of ID are not automatically updated with your address when you move. In the US, elections are conducted explicitly based on where you live, with districts cutting between neighborhoods. (There are no ""presidential elections"", just deciding how your state should vote.) So, if the ID you got when you were 18 says you live in Dallas, but you're trying to vote a year later after you moved to San Antonio, you're not going to be allowed to vote with a strong voter ID law-or at best, you'll get a provisional ballot which likely won't be counted anyway.  Changing these IDs is not an unbearable burden, but it's also not trivial. There's a fee associated and you have to spend hours at the DMV(letters vary by state, but it's essentially the place that handles photo IDs for driver's licenses), which are notoriously slow and culturally understood to be the height of bureaucratic slowness. Since most people don't get paid for taking time off and it occurs during a workday, AND most people under the age of 30 move more frequently, it's a process that not only costs the fees, but the time spent AND the time not earning wages.  2. Voter ID is pitched to solve the problem of a very specific type of fraud-that of someone claiming to be someone they're not at the poll. Impersonation voter fraud is not at all a problem in any real sense. Like, it literally happens less than once out of every million ballots cast. And every election board in the country has provisional ballots to ensure that someone's vote is not counted twice or stolen.       3. Having a government issued photo ID as the requirement pulls in the opposite direction of vote by mail and in so doing, creates a structure that suppresses voter turnout. Voting in the US is conducted on one day that is not treated as a holiday (although more states have been doing imperfect early voting). A law making it mandated to vote in person, with your ID has all of the problems of the first point above and actively reduces votes for people who 1) are out of the country, 2) working/doing childcare during the week 3) have mobility issues or illness on the voting day(s).   In sum, at it's best, good faith interpretation mandatory voter ID is a solution to a problem that doesn't actually exist and in actual practice it's designed to suppress votes.",scubafork,2024-11-24T11:17:03,24
"In Florida, the drivers license is $48, replacement copies (or ID cards) are $25. To get the initial voter approved copy here are the required documents that have to be brought to the government office in person: https://www.flhsmv.gov/driver-licenses-id-cards/what-to-bring/u-s-citizen/  Every time you move to a new address, a replacement is required within 30 days.   Every time you change your name (marriage/divorce), you have to bring those documents in person.   The offices in less affluent areas are packed, sometimes inconveniently located, only open during conventional working hours, and with an appointment can still take over an hour.  They expire every 10 years, though replacement copies can be ordered online if you have a credit/debit card.    To the average person that sounds simple enough, but to the poor who are more likely to have less stable housing & financial situations? The elderly who no longer need to drive? Anyone who lives in a remote location and/or is barely scraping by? Those required documents are also not cheap or easy to replace if lost and mostly unnecessary otherwise, so many just go without.   If the ID was free and provided by the government it would be far simpler, as they have that information and you would just have to show up to verify it.",amytyl,2024-11-24T13:45:55,9

"I haven't seen one of the biggest issues mentioned: there are many kinds of voter fraud, but photo ID only addresses ONE of them - voter impersonation. This kind of fraud is so rare that most states have zero cases on the books. There are too many variables and the payoff is too low.    Say you intend to commit fraud. You need to know 1) someone who is registered but doesn't plan to vote, 2) their local polling center, 3) their full name, address, date of birth, and any incidentals the polling center may ask for, and 4) you have to be the same gender, race, and approximate age of the person you hope to impersonate.

"I'm a former elected delegate, and have a couple questions for you.   >1. Voter ID is pitched to solve the problem of a very specific type of fraud-that of someone claiming to be someone they're not at the poll. Impersonation voter fraud is not at all a problem in any real sense. Like, it literally happens less than once out of every million ballots cast. And every election board in the country has provisional ballots to ensure that someone's vote is not counted twice or stolen.   How would you even know if person X obtains a ballot in someone else's name and votes it, in states without ID requirements?   You mention an election board and provisional ballot process, both of which do in fact exist everywhere. But then you say that combination ensures nobody has their vote counted twice, and that nobody's vote is stolen.   I present to you a case from this cycle which demonstrates why this can't be true. A student of Chinese citizenship [was able to vote](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/30/chinese-university-of-michigan-college-student-voted-presidential-election-michigan-china-benson/75936701007/) in Michigan.   We only know about this case because the student almost immediately returned to the voting area trying to get his ballot back (as it seems someone explained to him what he had done was illegal, and he wanted to reverse his actions right away).   And yet, the vote was counted because once it's removed from the voter jacket, all ballots are anonymous forever forward. Even in this ideal scenario, we couldn't isolate this invalid ballot.   Therefore it is my claim that you've misunderstood the system's ability to safeguard itself, and that once this is recognized it is difficult to accept as fact that this thing we can't detect is truly a rare event. To emphasize this point, the University of Michigan incident required this Chinese national to simply store a student ID and check a box swearing he was eligible to vote. Had he not returned to attempt reversing his error, zero systems would have kept that ballot from being counted.",skins_team,2024-11-24T11:42:43,-3

But guess who's most likely not to own one: poor people and people in cities (where public transit at least exists).

"re: voting twice [https://www.eac.gov/how-do-election-officials-prevent-someone-from-voting-twice](https://www.eac.gov/how-do-election-officials-prevent-someone-from-voting-twice)   In short, if you try to vote at 10am, and then try to return to vote again at noon, the election officials should already see that you've voted earlier that day and then give you a provisional ballot.          In the Michigan example, a voter ID law would have also failed to prevent the ballot from being cast, because non-citizens can also get a driver's license and the person in question did use a photo ID(albeit a student ID). The ONLY way this would work would be if the government issued the voter ID freely to everyone.  And with over 150 million ballots being cast this election cycle, you'd need 150 more examples of this same type of voter fraud to say that it's more than 1 in a million frequency.   The implication that because a problem occurred and thus needs preventative for the future is only practical if the preventative measures are minimally impactful and will not have more of an adverse effect than the initial problem. For example, you do not carry a fire extinguisher on you every time you're hiking on the off chance that you stumble across a fire. Forest fires can happen, but the notion that you need to carry a fire extinguisher would be an impractical preventative action for a statistically insignificant scenario. The extra encumbrance of carrying the fire extinguisher would significantly impact your goal of enjoying a nice hike.   The question then becomes, at what level of frequency do we determine it's a problem that requires an impactful solution, would the solution create a larger problem and what would be the stated goal criteria? Is 1:1000000 problem unacceptable? If not, what is acceptable, and what side effects are we willing to tolerate to get to this acceptable state?  I posit that any election with under 70% eligible turnout is much more problematic and should be considered unacceptable.

In these small town cases we find organized voter fraud in the hundreds to very low thousands.

"I mean, I’ve lived in 5 different states which all charged out the ear for a new driver's license, which is what I was talking about. Some states offer cheaper ID cards, but they all charge something. Never heard of a special ID just for voting, but it sounds like a gimmick to justify a voter ID law.   A quick check shows that all states that have voter ID laws offer free “voter IDs” which often can only be used to vote. Looking at the AL site, it looks like a lot of documents are needed, which would cost money to get if they were lost, which becomes a barrier for something that is a constitutional right.   An equitable voter ID law would have to make all of those supporting documents free for an also free regular state-issued ID, which would need to be available at locations close enough to reasonably walk to. And if you’ve got anyone born, married, or other out of state, the state with the voter ID laws offer would need to pay other states whatever they charge for identity documents.

"Of our 50 states in the US, the majority of them (36) have voter ID requirements at the polls while millions of Americans don't have photo ID. These people tend to live in rural areas, are elderly, disabled and/or are low-income, racial and ethnic minorities. Typically, it's not just the cost of the ID itself that is a challenge. It is also the cost of paying for birth certificates, transportation costs and time off from work to complete the applications needed, for an estimated cost of between $75 and $175 per person. This presents a hardship for voters like these who have a legitimate right to vote but can't afford the time or money required.   So, even when ID is offered for free, there are still numerous costs that are prohibitive for some Americans for whom voting is a challenge. This is before you consider that there are obstacles that are intentionally put in place to impact who can vote. State officials have been known to make voter ID free but then shut down driver license offices in certain zip codes to make it more difficult for specific types of people to exercise their right to vote as was done in Alabama. Heck, they are even setting fired to ballot drop boxes in some zip codes for political gain.  So yes, in a perfect world free voter ID could be the simple solution. But as we all know, our world is far from perfect and when people are motivated to cheat to get an outcome that suits them, they have been shown to try rigging the system in their favor.

" States requiring photo ID include: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Missippii, Missouri, North Dakota, Wisconsin and a few other southern states (as if this weren't enough).  Of these states, those known to charge a fee for a non-driver license photo ID include: Alabama, Florida, and Texas.  I'm sure some will waive the fee if it's to qualify for voting but some don't. I'm sure you can find them if you really want to know.   However, the point of my earlier comment was to say that it's not just the fee for the ID itself that creates an obstacle to voting for some American citizens since there are other costs involved even if the ID is free.  Whether it's the cost of obtaining a birth certificate, unpaid time off from work, transportation costs (especially in rural areas) required to get the ID needed to vote, for some people these are prohibitively high obstacles just to exercise their right to vote. This is especially relevant when you consider the extraordinarily low incidence of voter fraud.",NeatNefariousness1,2024-11-25T10:10:35,3

Alabama is listed as one that charges for non-driver license photo ID. I'm not sure if this has changed since the source I last read was published but I'm sure you can do whatever additional cross-checking you're curious about. What's your point?,NeatNefariousness1,2024-11-25T12:34:21,2

"in kansas an ID is $14 and is required to vote. To get an ID in Kansas, you'll need to provide proof of identity, such as: A state-issued Certificate of Live Birth, An unexpired U.S. passport or passport card, A Certificate of Naturalization, A Certificate of Citizenship, and A U.S. Consular Report of Birth Abroad.  https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id  [kansas voter ID laws](https://sos.ks.gov/elections/photo-id.html)",LoneShark81,2024-11-26T00:14:40,1
"I disagree and you keep glossing over the parts of the problem that exist beyond the cost of the ID and how others' life circumstances may be different from anything you might imagine or care about. And as I said before, it isn't JUST about the cost of the fee for getting an ID. In fact, that part may be the easiest to overcome.   While I don't know how many states you've looked into, nor what the latest update on each of our 50 states might be, I can tell you that there is a reason this issue keeps coming up and oversimplifying it gets us nowhere.  So, let's end this conversation here and leave this to others who really intend to solve the problem in a way that provides equal voting access to everyone..
