DC certainly didn't get what it voted for   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election_in_the_District_of_Columbia   Getting smug without checking is trumpian.,quaglady,2025-04-24T16:24:22,1
Looks like they are saying that the reduction in tax base from reducing federal jobs & spending + bad commercial real estate market = problem paying back bond.,FlyingDiscsandJams,2025-04-24T13:05:27,8
Smug about what?    The USA voted for trump and is getting what they voted for.,ClassOptimal7655,2025-04-24T16:30:06,1
"DC is now n negative population growths. Less federal workers means less money, less workers.",Humble-Emphasis5982,2025-04-24T13:39:49,3
"DC didn't it never did (trump had gotten less than 10% of the vote every time hes run. The article is for the Capital City's (Washington, District of Columbia or DC) bond rating, not the entire US. DC and the surrounding metro are full of the professional government employees (NOAA, NSF, FDA, USDA, USAID, NIH, NASA and so on and so on) who are getting fired from their jobs that allow them to do a measure of good on behalf of the US. Competent technical people like that are portrayed as the ""deep state"" MAGA wants to destroy. It also doesn't help.that DC is both Blacker and more educated than most other jurisdictions in the country, which might also contribute to why the city is being made to suffer under the Trump administration.",quaglady,2025-04-24T16:40:16,1
