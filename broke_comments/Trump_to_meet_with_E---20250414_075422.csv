"[El Salvador celebrates dramatic decrease in criminal violence](https://i.imgur.com/35HO6r3.png) during [the Biden administration.](https://i.imgur.com/Tusf26f.png).   Biden was basically like, El Salvador is a crime ridden shithole... let's bring as many of them here as possible.   Progressives proclaim 'oh good! we can help the victims!'... conservatives say 'uh, won't the criminals avoiding prosecution take advantage of this opportunity to leave?'  How fucked up and self-destructive is your progressive immigration policy when you favor immigrants from the most violent nations- explicitly because the nation is violent.",BarrelStrawberry,2025-04-14T09:28:23,8

Part of the reduction in crime in El Salvador has to do with the president there cracking down on crime and arresting gang members in large quantities and putting them in their new facility. Not necessarily entirely due to gang members coming to the US.,theboss2461,2025-04-14T09:32:07,82
The first round of AEA deportations was quick because they were all known gang members as determined by the courts well in advance. New ones will be at an ad hoc basis because the backlog is gone.,cplusequals,2025-04-14T08:34:08,9
"You have to start somewhere. I'd rather be happy about getting some out than pout ""but it's not ALL of them only some""",DonkeyMilker69,2025-04-14T11:19:42,0
"Obviously, but if you are a violent gang member in El Salvador worried about prison and hear that the US is open for immigration, both legal and illegal with a growing El Salvadorian population... You'd be gone in about 15 minutes. And progressive liberals are welcoming them at the border with free hotels and debit cards.",BarrelStrawberry,2025-04-14T09:35:02,-6
