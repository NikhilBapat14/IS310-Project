Why does the articles author feel the need to make the distinction that she is a female in the headline?   Does that somehow change anything for anyone?,Quirky-Marsupial-420,2025-04-24T06:36:53,40

"Imagine what the opposite would’ve been. What if Kamala’s party won and a soldier refused this same thing.. the outrage would be over a whole different issue.   Manufactured outrage. Doesn’t matter she’s a woman, or fat, or whatever else. It matters that she’s grossly insubordinate when her literal career is all about submission and following orders.",itsyagirlblondie,2025-04-23T18:33:25,90

"If she's willing to be defiant over something as small as this, there's no telling how far she'll take that concept. Remove her command ASAP.   Gotta curtail the ""resistance"" rot or we'll be in a world of trouble. ",WPWeasel,2025-04-23T20:38:07,26

It’s on every installation. From your commander all the way up the chain of command.,OpeningJelly9919,2025-04-23T19:58:54,152
This display of the chain of command was at every military base I served on. It’s important that soldiers know their chain of command and who is in it. If you notice there are no senators or congressmen in that chain. Her displaying only part of it the way she did was clearly a political statement. It was clearly done in defiance of the highest levels of the chain of command.,johnnyg883,2025-04-23T21:30:07,129
"Um yes, every military base has pictures of the chain of command up to the President of the United States. Not propaganda or anything, it’s important for members to understand and rememebr the chain of command",LeatherName4367,2025-04-24T04:48:43,32
