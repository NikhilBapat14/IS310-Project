"No shit, people! Sad took a convicted felon, rapist, con man hell bent on destroying every aspect of the country and his billionaire buddies to convince these brainwashed, ignorant, racist cult members what a simple look at economic historical data could have told them before the election!

"For far too long people have misconstrued what being good for the economy really means.  It does not mean being good for the ultra wealthy and big business.  It means bringing prosperity to the country as a whole, even the least of us.",VanDenBroeck,2025-04-15T14:28:20,8

"Honestly seeing this stupid shit is exhausting. If we have a dem in office ever again the poll will flip the other way.   It shouldn‚Äôt be that fucking hard Dem states make more money, have better education and social services and when theres a dem president the stock market doesn‚Äôt shit the bed. The fact this isn‚Äôt jammed down peoples throats constantly is a failure of the party.",Revolutionary-Move90,2025-04-15T20:29:14,4

I want to gouge my eyes out that 43% say they trust Republicans.  Really?? After everything that has happened?? How the actual fuck can anyone in their right mind support a single thing they‚Äôve done.  ARRRGGHH ü§¨,I_like_kittycats,2025-04-15T16:27:50,2

Yet the democrats are so weak and lack leadership that they are still more disliked than the republicans as a whole..,GatorNator83,2025-04-15T15:51:21,1

"The sad part is that it just doesn‚Äôt matter and never has to the right wing. It‚Äôs been proven that Democrats do better with the national debt than Republicans, but Magats will continue to magat.   We thought ‚Äúshooting someone on 5th Ave‚Äù was a bit of hyperbole, but Trump and goons are now ruining America‚Äôs standing, making enemies of allies, doing Russia‚Äôs bidding, destroying or dismantling entire agencies, threatening the media, judges, and citizens‚Ä¶and the Make America Great crowd is cheering him on.",70sBurnOut,2025-04-16T01:32:21,1

"the fact that there are still 43% of the population that believe the party who is responsible for the majority of their hardships in life, are better for the economy, jobs, and everything else, tells you how bad the education system is in America.  We are the most stupid society that has ever existed, and let me tell you, there have been a lot of them over the centuries.",Ayste,2025-04-16T10:02:44,1

"That is still too small of a spread. That said, Democrats really have given away this issue, since the past three Democratic Presidents appointed Wall Street 'centrist' Republicans to run their economies.   Things kept getting worse, but slower, for us non-billionaires under them. Except Clinton: His 'free' trade support cost the U.S. most of our manufacturing base, making us reliant on China - eventually, and cost us most of our unionized jobs.",w4rma,2025-04-20T16:25:53,1

And then Democrats get blamed for it when they don't fix things fast enough after Republicans get voted out.,Snrub1,2025-04-15T20:37:30,35
"If I hear one more time about how bad the homeless populations are in blue states, I am going to lose it.  Yes, they have a bad homeless problem there because they try to take care of the people who need it. They don't ship them off to other states like the Republican states do on a regular basis.  I used to work in social services, and I know for a fact, in Texas, these asshats will put someone on a bus to a blue state and tell them to find help when they get to their destination.  Hot Wheels was regularly bussing immigrants to New York and other blue states because he cannot be bothered to be a civilized human being.  He would rather put razorwire in the ocean and river than help people.   So yea, Blue States do have more homeless people because they actually care about what they are doing.",Ayste,2025-04-16T10:06:59,3
"It is a phenomenon. America falls into these cycles. If there is a recession or rise in unemployment, the party in power during it loses. The people almost instantly turned on Republicans in 2007, and then Obama won. People became angry that Obama wasn't fixing things fast enough, and then Republicans dominated statewide elections in 2010. It seems like this is why the pendulum swings every 8 years.    Many conservative leaning independents just vote with their gut, and they don't usually look into things beyond what they heard from their family or what Fox News tells them. Once they get a good trade job, buy a house, and get a new truck, they think everybody else can easily just do what they did, and don't give a shit about making healthcare, childcare, or college tuition more affordable.      If under a Republican president they start losing their jobs or healthcare, they turn on them. Once a Democrat gets in the Oval Office, they think Republicans will make things better faster and get pissed at the Democrats for not instantly fixing everything.",x_xHaunter313,2025-04-15T14:56:08,3
"The internet has fundamentally changed the ability for people to be patient. The dopamine hit from instant satisfaction is too addictive. The economy is not something that can be fixed rapidly and is so incredibly complex. The people who demand it be fixed instantly have no idea how it works. Tariffs are the perfect example. Yes, targeted tariffs can be an effective tool to level out the playing field and help grow domestic industries. But it takes time to build capacity to start producing domestically and get domestic competition to lower prices of domestic made goods. Like factories and technology takes enormous amounts of capital and time to build. Like for chip fabrication. Tsmc is 20 years ahead of everyone else in the world and are literally the only company in the world who have the technology and knowledge to build the most advanced chips. You can't just spin up a chip fab lab and ""learn"" how they do it.",mezolithico,2025-04-16T00:10:01,11
