"It will never not be weird to me how for the entire 2024 election campaign Trump was like ""I'm gonna tariff everyone"" and then he's elected to office and is like ""OK I'm gonna tariff everyone now"" and everyone's like ""WHAT HOW COULD HE DO THIS TO US""  Of course it will lead to price increases.  It makes all imports artificially more expensive.",GabuEx,2025-04-11T00:15:10,65
"For five decades, Republicans used the argument that an increase in business taxes would inevitably be passed onto consumers, to kill any proposed new or increased corporate taxes the Democrats wanted to impose. The same logic, which is correct, holds true regarding higher tariffs. It’s borderline idiotic to think otherwise. In today’s environment, higher costs directly reduce the quality of life of everyday Americans.  It’s also a truism that once a price increase is imposed, it rarely, if ever, reverses, even if the cause of the increase is eradicated. Inflation in recent years is a good measure of that reality.   Regarding manufacturing, the USA will never see a day when it regains the dominance it once enjoyed, mainly because labor is so much cheaper in developing countries. A high skilled manufacturing job in Asia, for example, yields a wage of about $7 an hour. In the USA, we are debating whether fast food workers deserve $15 an hour. Our unskilled manufacturing jobs bring in on average, per the Bureau of Labor Statistics, about $25 an hour, just barely above a living wage.   Plus, virtually no one wants to return to the jobs Trump has in mind, mainly because they were backbreaking and often had long-term, negative health consequences. Had Trump ever held any of the jobs I mentioned, he’d understand that, but he hasn’t, so he doesn’t.  On top of that, building a manufacturing base takes years. Virtually no company is prepared right now to do what Trump fantasizes can be done with a snap of his fingers. Plus, just about every component we’d need to build products come from cheap overseas labor and most of our potential manufacturing workforce would need significant training, just to reach the level of “unskilled.”  Regarding Trump’s policies, he will eventually reverse, once Republicans realize that their grasp of power will be unceremoniously terminated by voters, yielding a lot of very stupid, universally lazy, and largely unemployable dolts to go out and find some of those Utopian coal mining jobs Trump keeps insisting we all want.  Finally, China-US relations are likely headed for a deep freeze, at best. That means we either find another source of cheap labor, accept higher prices for less, or do without.   Trump’s economic illiteracy, arrogance, stupidity, and stubbornness have created a situation where a win is extremely unlikely. A smart man would see this and figure out how to get out of it.   We, however, have elected the 2025 equivalent of Homer Simpson, who gets his advice from the real life versions of Barney Gumble, Chief Wiggums, Montgomery Burns, Moe Szyslak and Eleanor Abernathy. It would be comical were it not so worrying.",wsrs25,2025-04-11T02:05:27,20
"Trump policies can't return manufacturing to The US. Even with products from China doubling or tripling in price, US companies still couldn't compete with the price on a lot of products.  He can't keep all off these tariffs long term, so what sane person is going to invest in starting production in The US, not knowing which tariffs, if any, are permanent?   And anyways it would take years, heard on BBC that they calculated it would take 3 years, and 30 billion dollars to move 10% of the supply chain from Asia to The US.   So there's nothing about these tariffs that points to more manufacturing in The US. And I don't think it was ever Trumps plan. I just don't get why he keeps claiming it, because obviously leaders of other countries know all this as well, so they would know it's a bluff.   The only theory I can come up with, is that he's saying it to trick voters?",piqueboo369,2025-04-11T01:30:14,13

"It'll lead to price increases. Ultimately that's what a tariff is, a tax on consumers. Tariffs can be useful to protect the interests of countries that do a lot of manufacturing, but when your country is largely service-based and is primarily a consumption society, tariffs don't make as much sense. There are a lot of products that businesses depend on getting from China, that they just *can't* get from the US (because the US doesn't make those things), so they're going to suffer too; they'll have to scale down on supply, and they'll have to charge more for their products. People are going to spend less, save more—easier to do when you've got more, not so much when you're poor, so they're going to suffer the most.  That being said, a trade war with China isn't good for them either. They depend on American consumers as well for their economy—America's a large, high income market; they can't just ignore it. If Americans aren't buying their products and they can't find a replacement market for them, then their businesses are going to suffer as well.  The problem here is that for some people, ""winning"" is about coming out on top—about getting the best of someone else. They can't envision the idea of everybody benefitting from something; and if everybody's losing, they'll still see themselves as winners if the other side is losing even more. The last trade war between the US and China had no winners, but China suffered more from it, so therefore, some people in the US might claim the US ""won"" as a result. Those people might be emboldened to do it again, regardless of the adverse effects it'll have on their side. But that's the world we live in—people will screw themselves over as long as the other side is getting screwed even more",AntarcticScaleWorm,2025-04-10T20:54:05,6
"Tariffs implemented in this way badddd idea.    Especially w/o a plan to “bring manufacturing”.  Smart strategic manufacturing yes (pharmaceutical, semiconductor, lithium batteries) etc.  Crap manufacturing No (hair ties, salt shakers, cocktail umbrellas) The unstable economy furthers extreme difficulty to raise capital to retool or build the manufacturing.   2nd he brags about negotiating the tariff to equilibrium.     Well that takes a lot of time and TRUST.   Do you ever want to negotiate or deal with an asshole.  Nobody does and you never trust them.   You will always look elsewhere if you can.      Thirdly do you know who owns a lot of US bonds. China does and other countries who will use it as a weapon.   They dump them when the economy is unstable.   Isn’t that happening now?      Also, history has proven tariffs only work on particular and specialized mkts or industries    to protect your industry.    Mass tariffs are like using a flamethrower to kill a fly in your family room.   Finally, what message are you sending when you don’t tariff the naughty countries I.e Russia etc.      Really what this about is grifting for the rich and rich institutions and economically oppressing the working class  Guess where a huge amount of our prescriptions are manufactured???

"In 2005, Mr. Schumer railed about how the U.S. suffers from [China’s](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/) “unfair trade policies.”  “They don’t let our goods into their country. I can tell you company after company in New York who cannot sell goods in [China](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/) or can only sell them under impossible conditions,” Mr. Schumer continued, “The Chinese make no effort to prevent the ripping off of our intellectual property. These are our crown jewels. The thinking. The great creativity. The great entrepreneurial-ness of the American business community is just taken, and they shrug their shoulders.”  Saying the Chinese “pile on” unfair rules that violate free trade, Mr. Schumer called on his colleagues to support legislation to impose a 27.5% tariff on Chinese goods.  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  There are only two things wrong with tariffs.

I've read every comment on this thread, and no one is able to articulate whether or not the status quo ante was OK, and if it wasn't, what would THEY do to change it.  If President Trump is successful, there's going to be a massive defeat for Democrats in the upcoming midterms.

"> But with the implementation of the tariff policy, will it lead to inconvenience in daily life of ordinary people?  100% yes.

There will be price gouging on top of the tariff pain.  > Can Trump's policies return manufacturing to the United States as he wishes?  No, and it's not even a reasonable claim.

A tiny bit is good for you, but you don't need to add any to your diet because doing so will poison your body.  As many politicians and pundits have pointed out over recent weeks, tariffs are similar. Careful, targeted tariffs can be useful, but huge blanket tariffs can be devastating. Worse, using them for purposes other than specific trade issues can be counter-productive. Examples would be, as a means of replacing income tax, as a means of punishing people criticizing a leader with a fragile ego, or as a way to trigger the libs.   The other contributing factor here is uncertainty. When Trump says he is ""pausing"" the tariffs for 90 days, instead of simply reversing them, he adds uncertainty, which causes hedging of bets.

"Yeah, and as bad as COVID was, it probably saved him.  Four years to forget the harm and the economic meltdown he was causing, then was hidden by the pandemic economic downturn, which somehow the right thinks Biden owns.",Za_Lords_Guard,2025-04-12T11:38:34,1

The problem is that he has a 8th graders understanding of Trade.   And the mind set of leveraging all tools available to get what he considers the best possible deal.  Which is a bad combination.  2 weeks ago I pointed out tariffs were stupid.  And got a message later about Trump will bring jobs and trade back and its a good thing.  Never mind the fact that we are basically thrusting a sword into our stomachs disembowling ourselves in the process in trying to bring back manufacturing.  Which won't really happen anyways.,Wermys,2025-04-12T05:50:53,2
The day we can't buy their products is the day the Oligarchs demand the government implement a basic minimum income. And then the real dystopia begins.,BluesSuedeClues,2025-04-11T10:45:32,3

"Donald is one of the most damaged people ever to sit in the white house. He is a child who's figured out that all he has to do is be a lying asshole to get the world's attention, receive the adoration of 30% of America plus stupid people will by his Chotch-Keys. Sadly he is a reflection of how sick and stupid many Americans are.",SparksFly55,2025-04-13T21:34:46,2

"I loved The Expanse, but what really stood out for me was the wealth disparity and living conditions of the masses on Earth.  Man that looked entirely too prescient the way capitalism is evolving into an oligarchy here.",Za_Lords_Guard,2025-04-11T10:50:06,5

"I suspect it is only a matter of time before we get there. If our overlords are smart, they will make sure education online is free. Leave it as a ladder anybody with the self discipline, hunger and intelligence can use to climb out of the slums and into elite. If there is no hope for the masses, they will get violent.  Edit: *The Expanse* books and show are both excellent.",BluesSuedeClues,2025-04-11T14:24:38,3
