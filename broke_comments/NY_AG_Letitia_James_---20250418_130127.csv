Of course she would. Even if it comes out in court and all evidence shows it's true she'll still deny it and say it's Trump‚Äôs fault.,triggernaut,2025-04-18T13:07:10,70
"Hmmmmm, this is very reminiscent of the Fani Willis situation. As memory serves, she also claimed the allegations against her were absurd and that didn't turn out so well for her.

"This is what we in the mortgage industry call ‚Äúmisrepresentation of occupancy‚Äù, which is illegal. There‚Äôs literally a disclosure that goes out and is signed by the borrower at the time of application labeled ‚ÄúMortgage fraud is investigated by the FBI‚Äù. This falls into said category. Soooooo, your fucked idiot. You 100% lied about it being your primary residence (which we all know it‚Äôs not). Now suffer the consequences. Zero sympathy for borrowers trying to scam the system to get a better interest rate on a mortgage for a primary residence vs an investment property or second home.",Hezakia84,2025-04-18T13:32:26,35

"Well first off she would actually have to be charged with something.  Only thing that has happened as of now is the issue was sent to DOJ as a criminal referral.  DOJ actually has to do something productive and charge her.  We want perp walk, mugshot, and news cameras in the courthouse (although I don't think that's allowed in federal courts).",Can_Not_Double_Dutch,2025-04-18T14:46:23,14

It‚Äôs not weaponizing anything. She misrepresented occupancy which is illegal. She signed a disclosure that said mortgage fraud is investigated by the fbi. Misrepresentation of occupancy is on that list. The rate difference between a primary residence vs second home or investment property is pretty substantial. The mortgage would be sold back to the lender as a scratch and dent loan unless they are servicing the loan. The lender and federal government can go after her for said crime and the lender will most likely get slapped for financing a mortgage with obvious red flags. I have to take more than a dozen classes on this every year to be in compliance with BSA regulations (I obviously work in the mortgage industry).,Hezakia84,2025-04-18T14:36:39,7

"It is weaponizing because a bunch of investigators went out to find something, anything, on a victimless crime becuase of the person involved. It‚Äôs what she did to Trump. He‚Äôs now doing it to her. It‚Äôs unfair in both cases, though on a karmic basis she had this one coming.    It‚Äôs a product of excessive criminal laws, and it‚Äôs prosecutorial conduct that lies outside normal process. Normal process would decline either of these cases because both are dumb and not in the public interest and if they are anything should be a civil process where perhaps you have to pay more interest. It‚Äôs our closest functional equivalent of ‚Äòshow me the man, I‚Äôll show you the crime‚Äô   Just deserts I suppose, but it‚Äôs weaponization. None of these loans defaulted either Trump‚Äôs or hers. None of the banks actually were pissed.   Weaponization, like Trump has said in his EO, is bad for the country. I think he should make the point by conspicuously dropping it or pardoning once it‚Äôs obvious she‚Äôs nailed.",Unlucky-Prize,2025-04-18T14:46:39,-5
"One theory is they went all in on DEI and started promoting people past their point of competence and pushing out technically skilled careful white male lawyers who used to fill a lot of these roles if they didn‚Äôt have excellent interpersonal ability, political skills, and honestly looks.  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs controversial to say that this is sloppy conduct for the AG of NEW YORK. Like.. NY is the big leagues as states go. You should expect exceptional humans in a job like this. Ag is the kind of job you have before governor then before president. She‚Äôs not that level of talent.",Unlucky-Prize,2025-04-18T14:29:20,2
"It‚Äôs not. Any borrower would be subject to the same issue regardless of political affiliation. Whether it‚Äôs a forensic underwriter, the federal government, the servicer of the loan, the direct lender, doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs literally a lending law. I work in the mortgage industry. It‚Äôs standard practice across the board.",Hezakia84,2025-04-18T16:32:19,4
This was only discovered via sending investigators on a hunt. This happens a lot usually not detected and seldom if ever prosecuted except in cases the money is stolen. It is weaponization and the same thing they did to Trump. No bank complained about his loans and yet he had to pay 500m or whatever after it all got weaponized. The false records thing was similar.,Unlucky-Prize,2025-04-18T16:44:47,-7
"You do realize literally every direct servicer or investor (in the instance a mortgager does not service said loan in their portfolio and sells it to an invest IE Mr cooper, wells, planet, guild, rocket etc) all do periodic occupancy checks right? Literally being ‚Äúon the hunt‚Äù because it IS a problem. If they find evidence whether through federal agencies like HUD VA USDA or a Fannie, Freddie or genie backed loan they are subject to review from everyone involved. She would have been caught one way or the other. That is inherently different than the scenario you are trying to paint. I‚Äôm not a on my knees trumper. But one of these things in not like the other.",Hezakia84,2025-04-18T16:55:57,6
Typically they just ask you to fix it or you pay more interest. This is a custom stance.,Unlucky-Prize,2025-04-18T17:02:03,-4
"They really don‚Äôt though üòÇ. There is no ‚Äúfixing it‚Äù or paying a higher interest rate. Mortgages are fixed unless you are in an ARM. There is no adjustment u less you are in an ARM. The lock from the lender is legally binding. They would go back to the original lender, who again did not address certain red flags or the investor. They would all immediately go back to the borrower and take legal action. Who ever caught it would either A- threaten them with not addressing agency requirements (government backed loans) or B - threaten them being thrown on a sanction list for Fannie, Freddie, Ginnie. Again, I do this everyday on the upper ops side for one of these largest lenders in the US.",Hezakia84,2025-04-18T17:12:05,6
Banks hate foreclosing. They just want to cover their risk. Forcing them to refi it out is a moderate intensity response.,Unlucky-Prize,2025-04-18T20:14:12,-1
