"Can the pardon be reversed?  Say trump wanted to go after Hunter, could he somehow reverse the pardon and have Hunter Biden prosecuted?",Viks-Deciple,2024-12-01T23:33:07,5
"I’m conservative and a Trump voter.   I approve Biden pardoning Hunter.  It would be best for Biden to grant blanket pardons to most politicians to end the lawfare madness — pardon the Clintons, Obamas, Trumps.",hgqaikop,2024-12-01T19:03:07,-6
"Precedents matter and Joe Biden just made a *huge* one.  Basically, any President now has something to point at to pardon any family members of federal crimes.  But there's a second and much bigger precedent he set, or, using his own words, ""I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice"".  That 100% is going to be used to defend the pardoning of everyone from Jan6.  Lastly, the fact that its for *any* crimes he might have committed since January 1, 2014 through December 1, 2024, even *those not charged with* is... well, that's big news.  Trump or any president could use this to basically  protect any of their allies from prosecution.  While I understand, the way this was done and explained is *very* bad and sets into play some *very* bad precedent.",LordFoxbriar,2024-12-01T20:24:05,-21
"I kind of understand, but don't like the precedent.  I wish he had waited until after sentencing, which [was scheduled for a month before he leaves office.](https://www.newsweek.com/hunter-biden-sentencing-gun-tax-evasion-charges-1976859) If it ended up being a non-custodial sentence, he could have just let it ride and preserved the idea that his justice department was independent of political influence. And if the sentence had been extreme, he could have let Hunter serve a month of it and then pardon him on his last day in office.  But pardoning him before sentencing just doesn't sit right with me.",nosecohn,2024-12-01T22:51:11,-3

"Under current precedent, no.  Once pardon, its final.  There is no means, Constitutionally, to reverse a pardon.  Now, could there be some route via the courts?  Maybe.  Entirely wide speculation, but say that some of the crimes pardoned were done *with* Joe Biden and he himself was a party to the crime, you *might* be able to get some judge to rule that there could be some limit, but given how the current SCOTUS looks at the Constitution with some of its rulings this last session, its clear that there are no limits beyond what is written there.",LordFoxbriar,2024-12-02T08:14:58,10

"Come off it. Trump literally pardoned Charles Kushner (his son-in-law's dad) at virtually this same time in 2020. And Charles Kushner was convicted of ""illegal campaign contributions, tax evasion, and witness tampering after hiring a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law"".   Oh yeah, and Trump's trying to make him Ambassador to France now.

"He pardoned Jared Kushner’s father in 2020, Not his child, but an extended family member by marriage. Charles Kushner served time for 18 counts of tax evasion, illegal campaign contributions, and witness tampering. He hired a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law and then sent a tape of the encounter to his sister, as retaliation for her husband’s cooperation with federal investigators.   Charles Kushner has been nominated by Trump to be the next ambassador to France.

Also if the options are targeted strikes against terrorist or bombing the hell out of the cities they are in- go with the targeted strikes where the casualties are going to be much lower.   Second I was not referring to the Supreme Court decision regarding Trump.      In 1973, amid the Watergate scandal, the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) issued a memorandum concluding that it is unconstitutional to prosecute a sitting president. Its arguments include that the president ""is the symbolic head of the Nation. To wound him by a criminal proceeding is to hamstring the operation of the whole governmental apparatus in both foreign and domestic affairs."" It says that the statute of limitations should not be tolled while the president is in office, but suggests that Congress could extend the statute of limitations specifically for presidents. After the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Clinton, the OLC issued a second memorandum in 2000, distinguishing civil and criminal presidential immunity and determining that it was still improper to prosecute a president due to the adverse affect it might have on his ability to govern.",catkm24,2024-12-02T09:30:10,8

"I'm not comparing crimes. Most if not all of Trump's pardons are indefensible.   The president just pardoned his son. He did so strictly as an act of presidential power and strictly for personal gain. His 54 year old son committed a crime and was given a pass from his daddy. It's not a good look.    Not only did he pardon his son, he pardoned him for 10 years of tomfoolery while he was running around high on drugs, banging young girls and spending Daddy's money. A slap in the face to any light criminal currently serving hard time for lesser offences.   The primary complaint is over presidential overreach and abuse of power. Democrats pretend like they should be trusted to self-regulate. Looks like they can't. The funny thing is, all you have to do is say ""yeah Joe Biden messed up, he must be senile or something."" But you're so traumatized over Trump it's literally all you can focus on and you drop your ideological consistency at the first opportunity.
