"From the article:  We sat with 350 attorneys for the NYC Bar Association's ""Defending Justice"" program.  There was great alarm over Trump's Big Law executive orders and attacks on the judiciary.  ""What we are witnessing today is not normal, and it must not be normalized,"" the bar's president said.  ""We should bring as many lawsuits as we possibly can to stop the administration from doing what it can,"" urged civil rights lawyer Ilann Maazel, a panelist.  At least two lawyers used the decidedly extra-legal term ""five-alarm fire."" Some spoke of their plans to attend a May 1 protest and their concerns over having their phones searched at the US border. ""If you can go on Signal, I recommend you do,"" one lawyer told another over a post-panel buffet table.  The unrest in the room had two main causes. The first concerned attacks on judges, including recent threats to their safety and the Department of Justice's flirting with the outright defiance of a court's order.  The second concern was President Trump's executive orders targeting Big Law firms. The White House has cited national security risks and claims of racism concerning DEI efforts when it imposed penalties on Paul Weiss, Perkins Coie, and others. Paul Weiss and eight other firms struck a deal, while Perkins and three other firms, all hit with similar orders, have sued and won temporary court orders blocking Trump's EOs from going into effect.",kootles10,2025-04-22T18:39:57,35

There's a large gap in quality between small law and biglaw though.,_Sadism_,2025-04-23T04:58:39,3
But does it matter as long as it gums up Trumps plans?   Heck I’ve only played Ace Attorney and watched like three episodes of Better Call Saul. I think I could make the moves in a…bad court thingy.,TBE_110,2025-04-23T07:24:04,3
Not always. There's decent lawyers who have their own firms & they can also pool resources to outgun the larger firms...,StrangerFew2424,2025-04-23T15:50:37,1
