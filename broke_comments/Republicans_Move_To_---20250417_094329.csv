">Continuing his statement, Sen. Tuberville pointed out that taxpayers’ money could be better spent on meeting the needs of America’s veterans rather than on leftist causes. Tuberville said, “We don’t need to waste billions of taxpayer dollars on research in Wuhan or transgender operas in Colombia when our own veterans are living in horrible conditions. There are more than 160 state veteran homes across the country that provide long-term care to eligible military veterans.”  I personally would like to see tiny house communities as a solution to solving veteran homelessness, I hope that's one of the approaches considered.",squunkyumas,2025-04-17T09:46:03,121
"Imagine getting a bonus on your paycheck for the holidays and your oldest son comes up and says ""Hey Dad, maybe you should buy this for mom!"" *right in front her*. Spoil the surprise, and now you kinda have to say something like ""Yeah... maybe! That's a good idea!""  The idea itself is great, out of $58B in USAID cuts, it's affordable, but it's the kind of thing you *discuss behind closed doors* and then include in a bigger proposal to present on the figurative Christmas morning. I also don't like how veteran treatment is always used as a cudgel against both sides, used as tinder for propaganda fires.  If they're serious about resolving the issue, then I'd like to see more focus on homeless vet **prevention**, rather than just throwing money at it. Address the cause.",Right_Archivist,2025-04-17T10:11:04,95

"Now, THAT would be “US aide”.   It’s just unfortunate that we can’t afford it.    If we ever balanced a budget and had a little surplus, I could get on board with things like this.  Until then, communities, families, and charities need to do better.",Narrow-Trash-8839,2025-04-17T12:52:46,18

"While not our country, did you see that article either last week or the week before of the UK vet who carried princess diana's coffin at her funeral dying on the street?   Yea, that one was beyond messed up. Really goes to show no one cares about veterans at all, just tools to be thrown away.",Beefmytaco,2025-04-17T12:43:18,37

"Why do veterans need to live in tiny homes like mice in some social science experiment? Did we have this problem with vets returning from WWII? Putting them in some tiny house encampment makes it as if they are helpless, distant group that doesnt deserve the dignity of living in a normal home.",milton1775,2025-04-17T10:00:45,5
Yeah don't be like Los Angeles that raised billions of dollars only to build 4 or 5 actual houses. Massive fraud always follows these government guilt traps. Someone's pockets are being filled.,BlackScienceManTyson,2025-04-17T10:38:01,23
"Concussive brain injury (permanent), severe PTSD (permanent), chronic back pain (permanent) - those are some  common reasons for some veterans to spiral into homelessness.    Not all of that is fixable.  It's part if the cost of war, and of caring for injured warriors.",OnlyInAmerica01,2025-04-18T15:02:52,5
"Of course the negative take is upvoted here.That analogy makes no sense and this would be a good move. This money would fund State Veteran Homes, which help take care of and treat vets in a variety of ways. They literally do prevent more homeless vets.",Hrendo,2025-04-17T14:04:48,19
Imagine being such an anti American hater that you complain about building homes for homeless veterans.  Republicans have to publicly lobby for this stuff because voters need to know what DOGE cuts can do.,dunkeater,2025-04-17T16:10:31,9
"> Address the cause.  That's great in theory but easier said than done. During the 20 years it takes to study and solve that issue, those vets are still homeless.",TBoneTheOriginal,2025-04-17T15:51:51,8
"Wait, so we are looking to divert 2 billions dollars of funds that went to completely useless things like Middle Eastern Sesame Street and spend it on housing our veterans, and instead of cheering, you complain because we announced it?

"Much like the proliferation of electric cars, Democrats will curse us for doing the things they spent the past few decades demanding ***but not actually doing.***  Our side is making homes for the homeless, their side just builds an ever-expanding homeless industrial complex to make themselves wealthy. Our country's glaring veteran problems in years past could be partly to blame for the military's recruiting problems in the present.  The fact we're helping out ***people who have made sacrifices for the country in the past*** will make Dems especially furious.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-17T14:13:10,7

I wouldn't do percentage of cost. I'd do fixed amount (cost of housing adjusted) and that way they can tradeoff how much they want to spend out of their own pocket.,ergzay,2025-04-17T12:33:56,6
I think it’s just about using the money to effectively help as many people as possible. I didn’t really think of it like that. I guess give them some options for what can be built given X number of dollars.  I saw these homes built out of shipping containers when I was in Copenhagen and they looked super cool. I think they were used for student housing.  **EDIT:** It was called [Urban Rigger](https://urbanrigger.com). Call me strange but I would love to live in one of those things.,zip117,2025-04-17T10:26:58,51
Beggars can't be choosers. Just deal with it. Smaller homes = more people with houses. Be practical. This is a government program so just be lucky if it doesn't get scammed away and something gets done.,BlackScienceManTyson,2025-04-17T10:35:32,47
"Lots of people are actively choosing to live tiny nowadays. It's a smart economic approach in a world where housing costs have drastically risen in recent years.  Furthermore, anyone willing to live in a tiny house like this has their basic needs met so they can start to gain their own financial footing and someday afford a more desirable home.",Sketch_Crush,2025-04-17T11:07:36,22
Why not? And why not put them in apartment complexes which can house even more?,rigorousthinker,2025-04-17T11:48:27,14
"As a vet living in a 350sqft home, I disagree with you. A tiny house on an acre sounds pretty awesome. A tiny house on 5 acres is even better. Land is better than a place to park your ass. It encourages you to stay active, which is the biggest issue I see with older vets.",PFirefly,2025-04-17T15:07:32,10
