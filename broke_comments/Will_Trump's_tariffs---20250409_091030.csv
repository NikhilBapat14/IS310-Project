Everything Trump does will reflect on him in any election bid. He’ll be seen as a co-conspirator and/or blamed for not trying to rein him in. Remember how Trump and the GOP blamed everything they could think from the last administration on Harris and not Biden.,calguy1955,2025-04-09T23:00:52,112
"Yes. If Vance runs, he’ll be seen as a continuation of the Trump administration. Unpopular presidents tend to weigh down their VP’s chances of winning. You saw this happen last election. Harris being the VP of an unpopular administration held her down. Trump is doing everything he can to destroy the economy, and should Vance run in 2028, he will be held responsible for the economic mess.",Reasonable_Ninja5708,2025-04-09T23:43:21,37
Voters who barely pay attention dont even know who JD Vance is. As far as they know it's Trump and Musk.,postdiluvium,2025-04-10T06:55:55,11
"Trump is a demagogue, and like many sociopaths he can appear to be charming in the right circumstances. He has built a cult following, or more realistically he has taken over the cult that Rush Limbaugh created.  Vance does not have the superficial charisma that Trump has. He will not be able to lead the cult based on his personality like Trump does. He is just one of the many suckerfish following Trump and trying to cash in on the scraps.  We'll probably see a Democratic House in 2026 and a Democratic President in 2028. And as usual, the Democrat will dig us out of the hole that is traditionally dug by the Republican President they are replacing.  Bush 2008 economic crash. Obama digs us out of it.  Trump 2020 economic crash due to the pandemic (mostly). Biden digs us out of it.  Trump 2025 economic crash caused entirely by Trump. Democrat digs us out of it again.",billpalto,2025-04-10T08:01:07,20

Do not forget how Vance blamed Harris for everything he perceived negative about Biden.  Works both ways.   I'd like to think getting f'd in the asss by Mango for 4 years will maybe change a few MAGA moron's minds in 28 but the last 9 years of absolute lunacy did not so who knows what will happen?,I_like_baseball90,2025-04-10T15:50:43,4
"If Trump continues his economic chaos, international betrayals, and domestic human rights abuses for his entire term, the Republican brand will be forever tarnished with his insanity and incompetence and deceit. Last time they fucked up this bad they lost the house of representatives for 60 years. And it looks like they're fixin to do it again only worse.",The_B_Wolf,2025-04-10T19:17:13,3
"I hope Vance runs. We can see a few things from this…. One: Did we learn our lesson?? Are we at least moving now in the right direction? Cause if he wins it’s over…. It says a lot. He is just so…. Punchable.  Their ego might set them up for failure cause if he runs…. With the way things have developed, he will have a low chance of winning",Mechanix2spacex,2025-04-12T02:24:31,2
"Trump has only been in office for around three months, it's a bit premature to be making predictions regarding the next presidential election. We have no idea how this tariff thingie is going to play out yet or overall how the administration will be viewed.  At this time in Biden's presidency his approval numbers were still healthy, then they sunk and never recovered over the next three years.",AVonGauss,2025-04-09T23:45:52,4

"Republicans are not going to win anything for a very, very long time.  Not only because trumps policies are disastrous for Americans, but Trump is going to die soon, and with him, the cult of personality will die.

"Since that hypothetical is, at a minimum, three years away, probably not. Most Americans will have forgotten about the pain and chaos of the last few days once Trump inevitable rolls the, back. The biggest threat the Vance will be Trump choosing a different successor.",GuestCartographer,2025-04-10T06:52:04,1
"I think the only question that matters in regards to JD Vance's political future is whether he can develop the personality to lead the trump coalition. I've seen very little indication that he can, he feels very unconfident and ingenuine when trying to bluster the way Trump does. For some reason I keep thinking about the donut shop clip, imagine trump in that situation. He would have found away, for better or worse to turn that into some sort of spectacle by berating the woman behind the counter or making some joke or just like, handling it in a way his base woulda been like ""that's my guy!"" Vance was just awkward and confused and demure.   Because Vance had no real identity nationally before this, he has no grounds on which to run for president other than being a continuation of trump, and he won't be able to do that if he can't develop the right persona. Pence, for contrast, had a very clear and crisp identity before becoming vice president, he was a known quantity and had a known moral compass (not commenting on whether i think it was a good compass, just known). That was his undoing in the eyes of MAGA in the very end, and also why he was able to run against trump in the primary with at least some level of seriousness. The ins and outs of economic or foreign policy do not matter to trump's base (that's why the chess not checkers argument is so popular for them because they just follow whatever comes out of his mouth as perfect fact), and so the effect of tarriffs is too technical for them to care when evaluating Vance.   Even worse for Vance, a LOT of people will be competing with him to capture the Trump Trance, precisely because they sense such weakness in his ability to do so.   Two things could interrupt this dynamic, one being a premature rise to the presidency for Vance (via Trump death, resignation cause he's bored, or impeachement and removal because he ends up doing something so heinously awful we can't even conceive of it turning the GOP against him, but i'm just considering as many angles as possible here). The other thing is Vance making a political calculation to NOT go after trump's base and making political decisions to break from the president in the way pence did. I don't think that'll happen, but it would change the trajectory of things if he did.",jacquesbquick,2025-04-10T07:19:34,1
"Trump's economy would effect JD's chances. Most of us agree tariffs are dumb, but there's a chance this all works out and JD runs on ""I told you so."" Nobody is going to look at 3 years back and remember the time Trump made us nervous and change their vote.",MrE134,2025-04-10T07:38:24,1
I think that the vast majority of the public will be furious by so many things by voting time next year alone. Trunk and Vance will not be affected by any of it though. By then they will have received voting information by to each and every person that previously voted against him will be challenging that their vote be thrown out. Leaving the vast majority screwed of their voting rights. Look at the NC court seat.,therealmikeBrady,2025-04-10T11:43:17,1
It should but who TF knows.   One would think Trump’s first term and attempted coup would have precluded a second administration but here we are (screams into pillow),elonbrave,2025-04-10T14:35:12,1
"If Trump finishes his on again off again strategy by 2026, I don't think it will have any affect on a JD Vance presidential run.  The republicans just need a good economy in those last 2 years  and they could get a rare (for them) back to back presidency.  If you're a ""vote blue no matter who"" kind of voter,  it also won't matter, but it will be cited as one of 100 reasons why they won't vote for JD vance.      JD Vance could give Trump the Julius Caesar treatment on live tv and 99% of dems wouldn't vote for him.  lol",discourse_friendly,2025-04-10T15:10:57,1

Vice President Harris was strangled by the public’s opinion of the Biden Administration in 2024. It would follow that any unpopular moves by the second Trump Administration would be a heavy albatross around Vice President Vance’s neck as well.,Ana_Na_Moose,2025-04-12T01:02:14,1

"That may be true but negative partisanship is a stronger motivator than positive partisanship. A lot of people are going to get very hurt by what Trump is doing and pain motivates people. There are a lot of people who sat out or lodged protest votes based on their pet issues because they hate the feeling of voting for what they consider the lesser of two evils. Trump is giving a master class on why it actually matters in a binary system like ours. When Hoover presided over the beginning of the Great Depression it turned a lot of people against the entire republican party for a generation.   While I’m not saying the same thing will happen here, it will definitely provoke a reaction in the next election. We’re not even 100 days into this presidency and it’s been absolute chaos with the real long lasting consequences for people’s lives not even really appearing yet. When businesses start shuttering and unemployment starts spiking, this won’t be given a pass of some force majeure event like the pandemic. This will be seen as a self inflicted wound by everyone but the most hardened of the MAGA base.

"There’s no formal definition of a crash, but the Dow lost over 10% last week, which meets the informal definition.

"I think the ""swing voters defining the election""  is mostly a myth.  Or at least it isn't the complete picture and it's more complicated than that because there's more than one set of moving parts in our elections.  I think what decides the election more so is voter participation.   Not independent voters who swing back and forth, but apathetic people, usually Democrats, who only show up when passions sweep them up.    This is why they Republicans try to suppress voter participation by making it more inconvenient, and Democrats always try to get people to turn out by making it easier to cast a ballot.  There are more people that favor Democratic policies and if they do vote more often than not they vote for Democrats.   Republicans fall in line, always.  The nature of the right wing is they will line up and support whoever gets the nomination.   They are reliable voters, even if they may be less numerous overall.   They value the chain of command, respect authority, etc.  So even if they were not thrilled with Donald Trump, you don't abandon your team because the QB is weak this season.    Democrats must fall in love to vote.   This is why Obama won, but Hillary didn't.    M Biden I think was kind of an exception because Democrats were so passionate in their hate against Trump that they were really to vote for anyone to get rid of him.    So many Democrats this time we're not passionate about the election after 4 years with Biden because voters on the left always let perfect be the enemy of progress.  Democratic lawmakers do disappoint... I'm not going to pretend that they are perfect.  They aren't, but voters get discouraged and stop showing up after one presidential term if everything they wanted doesn't get done.   Joe didn't didn't he get us universal health care??  We lost abortion?! ""Genocide""?! He didn't forgive student loans (even though the save plan made some PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL moves to provide relief.... that the media didn't report on.)    I even saw liberals/american left say with complete confidence that better was 'built to fail"" because Biden knew manchin and sinema would never vote for the social aspects, etc.  Maybe, but... Maybe we just needed more than a fucking 50% majority in the Senate?  Nope. Everything is conspiracy!  so instead of using BBB failure as a rallying cry to organize and push harder for more Democrats, they use it as a justification for cynicism and apathy.    So sure there are some people that may have pivoted, but I think the bigger cause was the number of people that JUST STAYED HOME and protested the election where they didn't like either option (and apparently don't care about state and local).  Never mind that having a choice is infinitely better than NO choice at all, like so many people in the world get.  But lots of Americans take democracy for granted I've learned.   Too many people look at their vote like it's a personal reflection of all of their values rather than a practical step they can take to move the world in a different direction.  Not that I don't want to see our Democratic institutions improved, but I still will take imperfect ones over none at all— because we are quickly headed down that path now because people were so damn apathletic to show up and vote for the candidate that most closely resembled themself and actually had a shot at winning.    More eligible voters didn't vote than ANY OTHER option.   Maybe this should  trigger some kind of runoff or the election has to happen again with new candidates.   The second biggest amount voted for somebody other than Trump.   The third biggest amount voted for Trumop.    The first group is aware of the rules, and they could've had an impact.  Now of course, 2 million Democrats voted in California wouldn't have made a difference.   But if everybody voted all if the time, this country could look so much different.     Hell, people need to fucking start voting in the primaries.  The biggest complaint is that people don't like their options.   Well, get involved in that part of the process then!",eh_steve_420,2025-04-11T23:53:47,1
"That's just their excuse for not voting for the brown woman. No matter how much Harris may have put them off, to willing vote for this says it all.
