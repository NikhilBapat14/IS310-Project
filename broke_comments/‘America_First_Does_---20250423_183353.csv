"America was Great in the first place because it forged great relationships with other countries, became a military power that enabled countries to be democracies, made strong trade ties with both other super powers and growing economies. The relationships weren't perfect and all sides had spme shitty issues, but if anything, the number 1 benefactor of all those was America. It boggles my mind that a lot of people think isolationism will make america great again when that's the farthest thing that would make it so",LastManSleeping,2025-04-23T22:56:06,888
"The problem is that America absolutely sold out some of its people to benefit others. Outsourcing manufacturing, textiles, several other “old school” industries needed to be managed in a way that considered those left behind. Post industrial America is certainly great in areas that benefited from the rise in tech, financial services, etc., but it is absolutely *not* great in the old former mill/factory/coal towns that have turned into meth villages and ghettos with no jobs, no infrastructure, and no hope.",smp501,2025-04-24T16:18:20,3
"My opinion has always been that anything that CAN be made in America, SHOULD be made in America, in order to reduce our dependence on other countries.  That doesn't mean that we cannot trade and make deal with other countries, but that such trade should not be essential for our survival.  I mean, people are complaining about how these tariffs caused the cost of essential goods to skyrocket right? Well, that just highlights the issue. At any time those same countries could decide, ""we're implementing 500% tariffs on all goods going to and from the US"". . .and the US would be screwed.  Those essentials goods should be produced and be available here in the US, so that we don't run that risk. We can still trade in those goods, but we shouldn't rely on that trade.  Additionally, if there are policies, regulations, methodologies, or technology that prevents the US from producing those goods as efficiently or as cheaply as another country, then that is where we need to focus reform.",xAdakis,2025-04-24T07:17:01,-46
"It is good to produce strategically important products in the US, but how much of it do we make?    We can do it, but the American made version will be more expensive.  And we will be pulling manpower from other places, reducing our output elsewhere  The Buy American Act, the Jones Act, agricultural subsidies, etc. are all intended to help strategic industries keep some capacity in the US.  However, it isn't enough to provide luxuries to our whole population, and the end product isn't always as good   > That doesn't mean that we cannot trade and make deal with other countries, but that such trade should not be essential for our survival.  > I mean, people are complaining about how these tariffs caused the cost of essential goods to skyrocket right? Well, that just highlights the issue  If we only make the bare minimum for survival, then of course prices will increase if we limit trade to the rest of the world.  Americans like to do more than just ""survive""  > if there are policies, regulations, methodologies, or technology that prevents the US from producing those goods as efficiently or as cheaply as another country, then that is where we need to focus reform  A lot of countries produce products cheaper than us because their cost of living is so low.    It will always be cheaper to hire someone in Vietnam to work in a factory for $200 a month than it is to hire someone in the US for 25x that  There is nothing that we can do through government to change that",you_cant_prove_that,2025-04-24T09:09:41,39
"The question now is what is the definition of can? is it just ""can you manufacture shoes?""or ""can you manufacture cheap sellable shoes?"" or ""can you manufacture shoes with a certain level of skill?"" or ""can you manufacture enough shoes?"" etc. etc.   I doubt it's realistic because at the base level, people would rather buy cheap clothes and do some other things they can and want to do than buy thread and yarn and sew it themselves. Plus, the more likely outcome for all of this is a lot of industries will automate, and the money will just circulate around big tech and manufacturing companies, not the labor sector as a whole.  For sure there should be energy independence, food security but i would bet my house people wouldnt suddenly want to work on sweatshops and plant corn. It could theoretically be done of course, but will it?",LastManSleeping,2025-04-24T09:31:44,16
"You realize trade creates wealth, right? Clamping down on mutually consenting transactions necessarily will make you and everyone else poorer. The reason why America is strong in the first place is because we *don't* do this. If you want to go have a stagnant economy like Canada or the EU, by all means you can move there, but the rest of us prefer living in the greatest country on earth.  If you want to make the argument an essential component of military equipment shouldn't be monopolized by a geopolitical adversary, sure. But ""Essential goods"" in your terms probably is much broader than that and probably applies to most things.",cplusequals,2025-04-24T09:40:02,29
