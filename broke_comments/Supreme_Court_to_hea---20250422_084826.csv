"The left wants you to believe that this isn't happening. If it's not happening, then why is there a Supreme Court case about it?",theboss2461,2025-04-22T08:52:51,78
Why is anyone discussing sexuality or sexual orientation with young kids? Creeps.,Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-04-22T09:13:08,61
"I'm gay and many of us do not believe such books belong in schools. But if we speak up we're vilified by our straight social justice lib ""allies"" who insist they're the arbiters of all that we must believe.  And to be a broken record: My LGBs have nothing to do with all the extra letters and symbols attached to our community.",booboosan13,2025-04-22T10:57:19,28
Ugh can the left just GTFOH with this nonsense?,downsouthcountry,2025-04-22T09:15:12,46
"The left: We want to protect the rights of minorities. Also the left, (to the Ukrainian and Muslim minority plaintives trying to exercise their constitutional religious rights): YOU EVIL TRANSPHOBES AND HOMOPHOBES, HOW DARE YOU BETRAY US?!",XLII_42,2025-04-22T09:24:39,42
Isn’t it strange that this has to be heard by the Supreme Court? In just a couple decades society has reached some incredible extremes. I remember my schools sending out a letter for parents to sign so we could attend a sex ed assembly in 5th grade. Even on some holidays the schools would seek parent’s permission just to show your kid a Christmas or thanksgiving movie.,Traitorparrot,2025-04-22T10:00:00,10
"Only the Left can come up with the idea of G-Rated pornography.   When this junk started flowing into mainstream culture, a lot of people on the right noticed the linguistic jujitsu coming from the Left. I remember hearing ""stop using their language"" and other such phrases.  And yet here we are, ten years later still using their language.",Cool_Cat_Punk,2025-04-22T09:59:38,9
"I hope they rule against the parents....  the case is framed as one that lets parents opt out of anything based on religious beliefs... slippery slope for children with Muslim parents.  I dont want parents opting their children out of lunch during Ramadan, or out of music, science, history, etc.  it wouldn't be fair to those kids.",madonna-boy,2025-04-22T09:34:17,-32

"Being made a villain by an incredibly small minority is not something to worry about. Speak up for what's right. We can't let them win, remaining silent is guaranteed defeat.",theboss2461,2025-04-22T11:32:10,13
"Yeah I always thought the people adding extra letters after the LGB were like the purple teletubby in that one meme.  https://i.imgur.com/R1z5P1t.jpeg  People arguing “don’t hate us, we were born this way!” and then a bunch of furries and MAPs (pedos) show up like “yeah ALL of us were born this way, you tell ‘em!”",_Eggs_,2025-04-22T14:16:30,7
People are leaving the left over this. We will see what happens in 2026. It will definitely be interesting.,theboss2461,2025-04-22T09:16:00,31
Don't forget the rampant anti-Semitism that's prevalent in the left.,theboss2461,2025-04-22T09:33:44,16
"You don't want parents opting their kids out of activities that conflict with their religious beliefs? The example you gave just made me support the parents even more. It's not a ""slippery slope"" that's exactly what religious freedom is supposed to look like.",theboss2461,2025-04-22T09:38:27,21
And this is exactly why we had the First Amendment. It's not up to you decide for those parents. No one should be forced to read anything they don't want to or participate in activities that go against their religion. Do you really want strangers to have that kind of say in your life? When the history teacher decides to put Mein Kampf in the curriculum you don't think parents should have a say?,bjbc,2025-04-22T13:29:16,6
"TBF, we have that problem too but yeah, it's much, much more blatant on their end and instead of trying to stamp it out, they use it, or try to, for extra votes",XLII_42,2025-04-22T09:35:39,3
opting a kid out of lunch is child abuse.,madonna-boy,2025-04-22T09:40:09,-17
"Tbh, everyone should read Mein Kampf. Understanding the rationale behind evil maniacs makes it easier to recognize this behavior in the future. The complete lack of understanding people have about Hitler is why the Democrats have gotten as far as they have. It's quite terrifying.",theboss2461,2025-04-22T14:25:13,4
"So religion is child abuse, but sexual grooming isn't?",theboss2461,2025-04-22T09:41:34,21
You mean burying your head in the sand and pretending it doesn't exist isn't a good strategy? Lol.,bjbc,2025-04-22T18:48:12,2
"I dont support solving one problem by creating another.  if you do, maybe you should be a democrat.",madonna-boy,2025-04-22T09:43:26,-12
It literally isn't a problem because the example you gave happens anyways. They already don't eat during lunch hour during Ramadan. They obey their religion. Insinuating that I'm a Democrat because I support religious freedom is absurd.,theboss2461,2025-04-22T09:49:09,18
