"One no-brainer goal should be to completely disconnect jobs from health insurance. This wouldn't solve everything, but would address at least one aspect of the complete insanity and should be relatively easy to achieve.",pgriss,2025-04-23T14:15:53,140
"I think the most workable solution, at least in the short term here in the US. Is to copy parts of the German system. In Germany, private insurance companies do exist, but they are by law non-profit. The Federal government in Germany also sets medication prices by negotiating with drugmakers directly on behalf of the whole nation. This gives them far more leverage with regards to drug prices. I would also create a national healthcare database system (in Germany we have an insurance hard that the doctor scans to get our medical history and insurance info) and make it so every provider takes every insurance, rather than negotiating with each hospital individually.  I think another knock-on effect is you'd need to lower the costs of medical school and lower the barrier to entry (such as strict quotas for doctors) so we can get more qualified doctors out and not restrict supply. US doctors are paid a lot more than their foreign counterparts, in part because they have to be to cover the massive debt they're put in. I think if we do away with the debt problem, wages wouldn't have to be so high (controversial). Doctors do super important work, but they are pricey and that can limit access in poorer communities (I'm open to the idea of other incentives to keep doctors operating rurally).  While a nationally run healthcare system may be desirable, it would be incredibly difficult to sustain the current revenues of each sector of the system. The healthcare system isn't just greedy insurance, it's profit seeking behavior at every step of the way, from insurance to drugmakers to hospitals. I don't  blame them, but to have the state take over that would be ... an immense and expensive undertaking. Transitioning slowly into a non-profit system with government playing an active role in price negotiations would be a good start towards removing barriers.  I think national healthcare is probably not a good idea for the US in particular, opinions are too diverse at the moment. I think if the state wants to play an active role in healthcare insurance (which I think there's a reasonable argument for) it would be best managed at the state level.     Edit: Thanks to Nope\_nic\_tesla for some additional context:   The non-profit private entities I refer to are more strongly connected to the state than the term suggests, please see their comment for additional context:   ""Although the Krankenkassen that administer the actual insurance plans operate as independent non-profits, they are funded by the statutory payroll tax and have most of their rules and coverages mandated by the government, and I think would be generally understood to be a form of public insurance in the American context too based on that""",StrategistEU,2025-04-23T14:04:39,64
"I thought the Medicare For All plan from 2020 was a good idea in terms of eliminating waste, lowering costs, and expanding access. The main arguments against it seemed to be that it's either a bad idea to eliminate so many jobs (which implies the waste is necessary) or that it's politically unfeasible (but we've seen some fairly unfeasible things happen recently).  Edit: Second point should be ""arguments against it (M4A)"". I was trying to explain the counterpoints - which I disagree with.",Dmagnum,2025-04-23T14:01:06,18

"Due to the current state of the US system, universal healthcare is unrealistic. However, it would be more optimal. The US spends around $13,432 per person a year on healthcare, compared to Britain spending $6,023. Despite this, the UK has a greater life expectancy of 2 years. Yes this is also partly due to food standards and average exercise habits, but healthcare is also a part of it. I believe the ideal system is universal healthcare, with the option of private. I also don’t buy the idea of people abusing healthcare particularly. People are deliberately injuring themselves/getting sick just to abuse free healthcare?! And for every hypochondriac, there is someone who never gets ill or refuses to admit when they are.

"Our system is so stupidly broken, and while I'm not going to praise our system (as I hate it), there are some things that I think can be done on top of some form of nationalized system to promote health even more.  My company offers a premium discount plus money towards gift cards for getting points in an app that are based around health. You get points for steps or activity, tracking sleep and getting good sleep, improving cholesterol over time, etc etc.   I don't know if that could be implemented if the government was involved, but having something that also promoted healthy activity does of course have benefits to it.   Essentially my company offers lower insurance rates and cash bonus for people who do healthy things.... Most likely because they pay out less to those people.   I don't know if it would be constitutional for the government to offer some type of bonus or discount for people who didn't smoke, were more active, worked towards making themselves healthier, etc., but the benefit is those people most likely have fewer health problems.",OhWhatsHisName,2025-04-23T14:52:58,2

"There is a saying that you have cheap, fast and high quality but you can only get two out of the three. Countries with universal healthcare get cheap and high quality but in a lot of cases it's excrutingly slow to get care.   The US as rich as it is chose fast and high quality but it's expensive and doesn't cover everyone. We have been inching towards more universal coverage  and trying to make things cheaper but it's slow. The Affordable Care Act was a big step forward and we will need to add to things incrementally like it as wholesale changes won't happen politically and logistically. The way people get care is deeply engrained and changing any aspect of it negatively will have big consequences that will undermine the effort.   The next big step doesn't have to be huge structural changes. It could just be a cultural change from the medical community to emphasize preventive care and lifestyle changes. The medical community is too reactive in how they diagnose things and mostly handwave prescriptive advice to just working out and eating right. Well when you're not specific nobody is actually going to do that. This may go into the whole longevity community spiel but western medicine has too long been stuck in treating things when it's too late. If we focus on giving pathways for higher quality of life it will also lead to better outcomes and overall cheaper care altogether.",Temporary__Existence,2025-04-23T23:51:04,1
"I compared and contrasted a bunch of countries, I think Germany's system is best suited for the US. The public healthcare system requires so that insurers are non-profit, and highly regulated. That to me seems like the best way to approach it in the US. Instead of relying on the government to build a broad bureaucracy infrastructure that likely wouldn't address all the geographical realities, just start tightly regulating insurers and remove profit-incentives until costs go down. Also devolving these policies and leaving it to the states so that they can better regulate realities closer to the ground.",illegalmorality,2025-04-24T01:52:08,1

"alright ....if we actually want to fix healthcare in this country, it starts by tearing out the rot at the foundation. the current system isn’t broken because of a lack of innovation or good doctors. it’s broken because it's designed to prioritize profits over people, with insurance companies and pharmaceutical giants rigging the entire structure. the fix isn't more regulation or more bureaucracy. it's a total reframing of how we incentivize care, manage costs, and punish exploitation.  we need a system where patients are directly rewarded for taking care of their health. not just vague wellness programs, but real, tangible benefits ,,,,lower insurance premiums, tax breaks, and direct cash incentives for things like maintaining healthy bloodwork, showing up for checkups, and staying within optimal health ranges. doctors too should be compensated not just for how many procedures they perform, but for how many of their patients actually stay healthy. if your patient population is thriving, your pay should reflect that. it flips the whole dynamic ....from treating sickness to actually preventing it.  sugar and ultra-processed garbage need to be called what they are: addictive, destructive substances driving the metabolic disease crisis. we treat heroin like a dangerous drug, but sugar? it's in everything, pushed onto kids, subsidized by the government. that needs to stop. schedule it. tax it. restrict its advertising just like we did with tobacco. use that money to subsidize real food ,,,,actual nutrition ....especially for working families stuck eating what they can afford.  pharma and insurance companies? they’re the twin leeches in this mess. pharma sets absurd list prices, then plays a shell game with “discounts” through insurance middlemen who skim profit off the chaos. the price you pay has nothing to do with what it costs to make your meds. it’s all smoke and mirrors. we need full transparency ...real numbers on what it costs to develop, produce, and sell every drug. no more rebates that don’t go to patients. no more charging $700 for insulin that costs $5 to make. and insurance companies should be stripped of the power to decide which drugs are “covered” based on what makes them the most money.  every hospital and clinic should have to publish the actual cost of procedures ...no more $10,000 surprise bills for basic scans. the pricing needs to be public, standardized, and easy to compare. if one place charges five times more for the same service, we need to know. and we need a universal safety net for serious, uncontrollable medical events ...cancer, catastrophic injuries, rare diseases ..fully covered through public funding, negotiated pricing, and strict limits on what hospitals and specialists can charge. you shouldn’t lose your house because you got unlucky.  this isn’t about socialism or free markets. it’s about flipping the incentive structure. right now, sickness is profitable and wellness is ignored. we can flip that. reward prevention, enforce transparency, eliminate profiteering, and treat healthcare as a human necessity ...,.not a corporate asset. because the current system isn’t medicine. it’s extortion in a lab coat.",Famous-Garlic3838,2025-04-24T11:20:13,1

"I have a personal belief that the US should have the mindset of ""If we want to be the best, we should either imitate the rest or improve upon it"" when it comes to the healthcare system. This means looking at what other countries have done, namely either Japan or South Korea. Both of which have their own problems in the healthcare system; however, their life expectancy rates are much higher than the US for much cheaper than the US.  This means a multilevel system that can't be adapted all at once. Japan uses a system like some American insurance companies do, with either 10/90, 20/80, and 30/70 cost split between the patient and the government respectively with heavy negotiations with pharmaceutical companies to keep cost down. In the US, patients are at the whim of private insurance companies and their employers.   South Korea is universally funded with an income threshold for contributing to the single payer system, and welfare medicare for those who can't contribute. If I understand this correctly at least.  Separate jobs from health insurance, eliminate private health insurance, and eliminate private tax companies like TurboTax, H&R block, etc. and simplify the tax codes! (They are why the government doesn't just send a tax bill. It was lobbied to be as difficult as possible so it could be privatized).   Socialize medicine like South Korea or Japan.

"A single-payer system would be ideal, but given the issues, there would be with implementing it (like banning insurance companies leading to unemployment, the lawsuits associated with banning it, the tax increases, and people being angry over their insurance being banned because some people want to keep private insurance for some reason) there's a plan that could get everyone covered and sorta gradually introduce the idea of a single-payer system.  The plan is called ""Medicare For America"". Everyone on Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, or is uninsured would immediately be put on the new government program called ""Medicare For America"" Everyone else can join it if they want to or keep private insurance as long as it is up to certain standards (so if you have good insurance you can keep it). The program would be funded by an increase in payroll taxes, tobacco taxes, alcohol taxes, a new tax on sugar-sweetened drinks, ending the tax deduction for health insurance, rolling back the Trump tax cuts, and premiums. The premiums are set by the Department of Health and Human Services or an 8% tax depending on which is lower (if the tax is lower you pay the tax, if the premium is lower you pay that). Employers would be able to buy it for employees. People who make less than 200% of the poverty line pay nothing, people between 200-600% pay on a sliding scale. There might be some co-pays (but there would be a cap on out-of-pocket spending). The idea is that people who want to keep private insurance can, people who want the government plan can get that one, and everyone is covered. That and since the government plan would be better and cheaper the hope is to have everyone (or almost everyone) switch to it over time and then be able to just pass a Single Payer plan. There wouldn't be any legal issues if they go bankrupt, people would lose jobs more gradually (which could be less bad to the general public), and they would be able to find new ones, and people would choose the new one and just get used to the government covering them, which would make single-payer easier to pass.

Residency is also just stupid, based on outdated beliefs of needing doctors to work ridiculous shift lengths for no other reason than that's what older doctors did.  But the goal of all of this is really just to make sure there are fewer doctors, so that the doctors that are there make bank, while the nurses do most of the actual work.  Medical procedures not having costs or estimates that are available upfront is also honestly ridiculous in a capitalist society; capitalism only works if parties have information about the transactions, and withholding the price of services until after they are rendered breaks everything about it.  Making them ""negotiated"" based on income is also honestly kind of insane, since it makes clear its not actually based on the value of services rendered, but an attempt to extract maximum capital of someone after the fact.  So the easiest ways to fix the US healthcare system seem to be just have Congress do everything they can to increase the number of doctors that are trained every year (so that increased supply of services drives down prices), and to make sure that prices for services are clear and available to people looking to pay for them.  This would eventually remove health insurance as an issue, since if people could just pay for healthcare, they would have an alternative over paying for shitty services that won't even provide what they claim.",verrius,2025-04-23T16:59:39,0

"I would like to see the US move to dual-payer, similar to the French system.  The primary payer is the government, which acts as the provider price setter and pays most of the costs.  The secondary payer is a regulated private insurer, which acts largely as a customer service operation.  (These aspects of it are also similar to US Medicare, although there are differences.)  There would be no networks. Providers would have the option of either accepting the government coverage and all of the insurance coverage or else take no insurance of any kind.  This necessitates pushing down costs and has to be combined with an increase in healthcare supply. That should include more internships, allowing nurse practitioners to provide more care and using pharmacies as the first line of defense with pharmacists able to write prescriptions for basic medications.  Given the nature of American politics, it would be wise to follow the Germans in allowing the wealthy to opt out. Make them pay into the system but allow them to obtain their services elsewhere on a cash basis from providers who do not accept insurance.  Americans should understand that many universal healthcare systems are not single-payer, and that many of those that are single-payer include carveouts. Private insurance can provide a useful tool, but not in the way that Americans use it that includes insurers setting provider prices and creating networks.",I405CA,2025-04-23T21:28:40,0

"The issue of health care in the U.S. is not ""solvable"" in the traditional sense. From the candy striper to the neurosurgeon, the entire system has been overpriced for the last century. Layer in a complex network of public and private insurance systems, and what you’re left with is a beast that impossible to tame.  Most reform efforts focus on reducing what individuals pay out of pocket, but the deeper issue is the system charges more than the general public can realistically sustain.  Consider this, a neurosurgeon might earn over $800,000 a year, but also pay $150,000 or more annually in malpractice insurance. If they’re employed by a hospital, that institution may be spending $50 million or more each year just on liability coverage for its medical staff.  When you scale those numbers across the entire country, accounting for all doctors, hospitals, insurance costs, pharma, medical equipment, and administrative overhead, the financial burden of simply maintaining the system exceeds what the population can contribute in total wages.   That’s not just inefficient, it’s unsustainable.   Unless you can lower the cost of a ER visit enough that a lower income individual can afford it ""without"" insurance it can't be solved.

I am not qualified to answer whether the US getting costs under control would increase the prices of other countries (Pharma marketing costs do not seem that useful to me so maybe they could reduce those expenditures). I tend to believe there's cost savings to be made in pharma and that it makes no sense for pharma to roll over for smaller poorer countries while playing hardball with the US. Even if the US is subsidizing others, I think it would be reasonable for the true cost of medication to be covered by all countries and not just the US. When you spread the cost of something over the whole planet, the increased cost is shared among more people, so instead of Americans paying $500 for insulin and Europeans paying $10, maybe everyone pays $15 (assuming that is happening, which I am unqualified to answer)",StrategistEU,2025-04-23T14:17:22,10

Maybe you are right that a single payer would be able to negotiate those costs down more than a for profit company that is also making a percentage off the top, but it would seem to me that the focus should be more on limiting the profits made by healthcare providers (especially the pharmaceutical and medical device companies who are making much higher profit margins than any insurers)  Limiting the percent of profit was a driver in increasing costs. A company may see a 20% cap on the percentage as hindering profits, but companies quickly saw that they could increase costs from $100/service ($20 profit=20%) to $400/service ($80 profit still equals 20%).   A universal system that negotiates lower prices like all developed nations do is currently the most successful path to limiting costs.",none74238,2025-04-24T05:17:19,1
The fact that insurance company profits are ostensibly capped shouldn't be construed to mean they are only a small part of the problem. Insurance companies will gate access to needed care by making patients go through a sequence of treatments which they may not want or need in order to get the care they do need. This raises the overall cost of care while simultaneously resulting in worse outcomes for patients.,VitaAurelia,2025-04-23T17:00:54,3
"I'm not necessarily advocating for single payer healthcare (although that would bring some considerable benefits). the US government can use its existing market power and ability to approve or ban medication to negotiate lower drug prices and then have private insurances pay for those prices. At the moment we have a pretty substantial difference between the cost to produce and the cost to buy and with stronger leverage, the prices would likely get negotiated down. If you control access to 300 million customers, drug companies are gonna want to play ball to get access to your market, compared to each private insurance with a much smaller customer base negotiating separately. The government doesn't have to necessarily pay for the care to still act as a brake on prices. Private insurance and government negotiation of drug and medical device costs can coexist and have already been used (Insulin prices were capped at $35 due to medicare demanding lower prices from companies).",StrategistEU,2025-04-23T17:40:08,0

"There’s no question that insurance companies contribute to major issues with our healthcare system. All I’m saying is that eliminating their profits doesn’t solve all of our problems. As long as healthcare providers are still incentivized to maximize profits, insurers will have to implement whatever cost saving measures that they can to pay out their obligations. Making them non-profit doesn’t mean they won’t still deny claims and route policyholders to lower cost procedures.",Dark_Twisted_Fantasy,2025-04-23T17:39:03,2

"I’m planning a move to a wealthy European country with a solid public healthcare system. I sat on the phone and online for a little more than half a day yesterday and have barely scratched the surface of solving my problems. Simple, it is not my friend. It hasn’t always been this way, but many countries in the EU are experiencing doctor and nursing shortages, coupled with funding shortages, and long waits for care. This has been very much a post covid issue IMO.   My husband and I are both on medications and on top of that, I have a history of breast cancer in my family. In NYC, I was fast tracked into their breast cancer preventative program and get all sorts of preventative care every 6 months even though I’m only 35. This is completely free of charge. Because I’m only 35, in the EU country, I won’t get a mammogram until I’m 40 or older I believe (I could be wrong, there was A LOT of info). I have to wait my turn. That scares me to no end because I have immediate family who was diagnosed with breast cancer at 41 and 40, so it’s potentially life threatening for me to wait and catch this too late (something that unfortunately does happen more often than you’d think in the EU with cancer under public healthcare these days). Then I found out some of our medications aren’t covered because some are illegal and some are deemed unnecessary under public care, like what?! Since when is preventative care medication unnecessary?! So then I get on the phone with a private healthcare option. And booooooy you should’ve seen my face when I found out about the LACK of coverage for pre existing conditions! That’s when I found we’d pay the same price for private healthcare in the US, but that NONE of our preexisting conditions or medications even the preventative ones that were unnecessary for dumb stuff like hypertension were not covered. I’m telling you. And the cherry on top? I asked about mental healthcare, because that’s a big one for us. A move is hard and I’d like continue therapy. Yeah, public option is to wait 2-4 years for a therapist and I can kiss my anxiety meds goodbye. And private DOESN’T COVER MENTAL HEALTH.   I asked the rep, how are these things not covered?! And he’s like, yeah, I get that question a lot from Americans, truth is, Obamacare is really great. It’s very different talking to someone who’s 35 from America and someone who’s 50. It’s really different over here. Both preexisting conditions and mental health coverage? Yeah, both Obamacare.  I had 2 very important life lessons confirmed for me yesterday.   1. Anyone who ever says to me voting republican and democrat is the same thing, after that discussion, is getting a slap in the face and a serious telling off. It’s a matter of life and death. Obama literally saved hundreds of millions of people’s lives and got called horrible, racist, names in return.  2. Adulting sucks and is hard everywhere. Take those rose colored glasses off and set them aside. There is no greener pasture. You have to fight and advocate for yourself no matter what. Always remember to fight for you and those around you who can’t stand up for themselves. Otherwise people like Trump will stomp on us all and have us believe it’s “the same”.

[The 20 Most Expensive Conditions Treated in U.S. hospitals, all payers, 2017](https://i.redd.it/ke9iwjc3cey61.png)  Drawing upon strategies that have worked for several other health systems, Regional One has built a model of care that, among a set of high utilizers, reduced uninsured ED visits by 68.8 percent, inpatient admissions by 75.4 percent, and lengths-of-stay by 78.6 percent—averting $7.49 million in medical costs over a fifteen month period (personal communication, Regional One Health, July 8, 2019).  ONE Health staff find people that might qualify for the program through a daily report driven by an algorithm for eligibility for services. Any uninsured or Medicaid patient with more than 10 ED visits in the Last 12 months is added to the list. The team uses this report daily to engage people in the ED or inpatient and also reach out by phone to offer the program. There is no charge for the services and the team collaborates with the patient’s current care team if they have one.   About **80 percent of eligible patients agree to the service**, and about 20 percent dis-enroll without completing the program. ONE Health served 101 people from April - December of 2018. Seventy-six participants remain active as of December 2018 and 25 people had graduated from the program.  Since 2018, the population of the program has grown to more than 700 patients and the team continues to monitor clients even after graduation to re-engage if a new pattern of instability or crisis emerges.   But its voluntary   The process of moving people toward independence is time-consuming. Sometimes patients keep using the ED.  One of these was Eugene Harris, age forty-five. Harris was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when he was thirteen and dropped out of school. He never went back. Because he never graduated from high school and because of his illness, Harris hasn’t had a steady job. Different family members cared for him for decades, and then a number of them became sick or died. Harris became homeless. He used the Regional One ED thirteen times in the period March–August 2018. Then he enrolled in ONE Health. The hospital secured housing for him, but Harris increased his use of the ED. He said he liked going to the hospital’s ED because “I could always get care.” From September 2018 until June 2019 Harris went to the ED fifty-three times, mostly in the evenings and on weekends, because he was still struggling with his diabetes and was looking for a social connection, Williams says.  Then in June 2019, after many attempts, a social worker on the ONE Health team was able to convince Harris to connect with a behavioral health provider. He began attending a therapy group several times a week. He has stopped using the ED and is on a path to becoming a peer support counselor.  ONE Health clients are 50 years old on average and have three to five chronic conditions.  Social needs are prevalent in the population, with 25 percent experiencing homelessness on admission, 94 percent experiencing food insecurity, 47 percent with complex behavioral health issues, and 42 percent with substance use disorder.

"That's an interesting read, and yes I recognize the gate keeping strategy makes sense in some contexts. But just because gate keeping makes sense in the case of avoiding unnecessary surgeries does not mean it is universally the right approach for regulating access to care. I had the direct experience of knowing, in consultation with my regular physician, that I needed a particular imaging study (an MRI). But my insurance company would not approve this study directly. Instead, I had to see a series of specialists, spaced out over months, who all agreed with my regular physician's recommendation, and receive a less effective imaging study (a CT), all to ultimately arrive at the point I started. It was a waste of my time, multiple specialists time, and an unnecessary procedure, all because my insurance company believes it has a better understanding of what medical treatment I should receive than my primary care provide.

What you see in justifying government spending, especially infrastructure projects, is that the jobs are held up as the point of the program rather than the actual aim of the project. Building HSR, for example, will provide most of its jobs in the construction and some more in the operations but that is secondary to the primary good that is rapid public transport.

Do you know why a heart transplant costs well over $1m in the US but the NHS can do them for well under $100k?

"Your looking at it as 100% or 0% innovation. They both will produce innovation, but for-profit has a tangible benefit for creating those innovations. They can profit from it til the patent runs out and it can be sold as generic versions.  I think thats the disconnect between the two views. They were saying that for-profit breeds innovation because it is a new revenue stream...but I read that as More innovation vs the national system. Now all or nothing which is I think how you were viewing their comment.  Basically that having a profitable aspect to innovation will speed it up because they have a vested interest in creating those new meds/treatments/machines etc.  Really overly simplified but an example would be a for-profit industry creates 15 new drugs per year while a national one may create 8 or 10. Whatever number you want to pick. The for-profit health care industries just would give the companies a financial incentive to reinvest their profits into research which overall would create more research and innovation. Basically they would have more money to throw at it to keep the US as top tier healthcare. It's just the cost and access of that healthcare is an issue.  Personally I really think a national healthcare system for your general health. Diabetes meds (which I have), regular check ups, vision, dental, The vast majority of your typical day to day healthcare. Private insurance should be to help pay for say elective treatments or non-essential stuff. Example, with a national plan i should be able to get an eye exam and a pair of simple glasses with a selection of frames but the taxes that fund it shouldn't cover me deciding I want a $250 pair of Oakley or Rayban frames. It should cover the generic version of a drug but if I choose to use the brand name version (unless the generic for some reason had issues or didn't work) then that should be on me (the difference in cost). Govt should provide a base level of care for everyone but I don't think ALL things should be paid for by the govt. Thats my ideal system. Everyone gets a free base level of care health/dental/vision. Private insurance would be there to help with the costs of higher tier care or elective choices. But I'm not stuck in that opinion, just how I feel it would fit best with both views. People would all get the care they need but private companies would still profit from the specialty treatments and medications that they recently invented or created etc.  Edit: Hamper does not mean stop, I guess I should have worded it as ""may slow"" or innovation may come slower due to less potential motivation/funding. Lets be 100% honest, a for profit company will be very motivated to find new stuff if thats how they make their money. Then after a period it becomes generic and the generic is available via govt plan.",JesusSquid,2025-04-24T09:44:51,1
"> I think in an ideal system, we can cut all of that fat since doctors should prescribe what is best not what they've been advertised.  Yes, but we don't live in a perfect world. Doctors don't have an uplink installed in their heads that informs them of every innovative treatment that becomes available in real time. In the real world, doctors are generally busy meeting with patients all day and don't always keep up with new treatments in what little spare time they have. Unless somebody goes through the effort to inform them, odds are good that many would continue to prescribe the same treatments they learned about when they went through their medical training, which could have been decades ago if they're an older doctor. It's a known issue:  > Harvard Medical School (HMS) researchers report in the Annals of Internal Medicine that older physicians may be less likely to deliver currently accepted standards of care. The study’s findings show that the number of years a doctor has been in practice may decrease the likelihood of the doctor providing technically appropriate care.  > ...  > There are many possible explanations for these findings, and perhaps most plausible, write the researchers, is that doctors’ “tool kits” are created during training and may not be updated regularly. Older physicians seem less likely to adopt newly proven therapies and may be less receptive to new standards of care. Additionally, practice innovations that involve theoretical shifts, such as the use of less aggressive surgical therapy for early-stage breast cancer, may be harder to incorporate into the practice of doctors who have trained long ago.  > https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2005/02/older-doctors-less-likely-to-follow-current-standards-for-care/  That's why pharma companies pay so much to send their reps out to doctors to tell them about new treatments. That's also why they pay to advertise so that patients might ask their doctors about it. If they didn't do those things, then a lot of doctors would have no idea that such a medication existed and would continue prescribing the same medication they've been prescribing since the 1980s even if there's something out there that works better.",Moccus,2025-04-23T20:26:56,1

">Doctors aren't robots. Practice varies according to location, time of day, relationship with the patient etc etc. You'd be surprised at how much variation in decision-making you find at the individual level from situation to situation much less across individuals. Few doctors are bad all the time and few are perfect all the time.  This is true, but we don't need to dissect all these sources of variation. Each individual physician will have a rate at which they make treatment decisions that differs from the standard of care. The reason for this departure is ideally the patient's individual circumstances, but ultimately the reason doesn't matter. What matters is that periodic departures from the standard of care are not only not a problem, they are expected. It's when departures from the standard of care become systematic that there is potentially a problem. Insurance companies could easily track each doctors rate of non-standard treatment decisions and then make decisions about whether to reimburse based on that doctor's practice history. They do not do this because it's easier to categorically state that departures from the standard of care will not be reimbursed, then allow patients to appeal when this is the wrong decision. It is the insurance companies who are failing to give the doctors agency to make individualized treatment decisions.  >i had a relative visit from overseas and got sick. Her insurance was stunned at the bill. They didnt have the controls and the hospital knew it. So every doctor within a mile radius was called to lay hands so they could bill. All of a sudden she had a new diagnosis that required a million different specialists to come and see her.  This is a separate issue. Obviously there need to be cost controls and health care provides should not take advantage of patients ability to pay, or lack thereof. I've at no point argued that only insurance companies are at fault for the high cost of health care.",VitaAurelia,2025-04-24T12:40:28,1

[The 20 Most Expensive Conditions Treated in U.S. hospitals, all payers, 2017](https://i.redd.it/ke9iwjc3cey61.png)  Drawing upon strategies that have worked for several other health systems, Regional One has built a model of care that, among a set of high utilizers, reduced uninsured ED visits by 68.8 percent, inpatient admissions by 75.4 percent, and lengths-of-stay by 78.6 percent—averting $7.49 million in medical costs over a fifteen month period (personal communication, Regional One Health, July 8, 2019).  ONE Health staff find people that might qualify for the program through a daily report driven by an algorithm for eligibility for services. Any uninsured or Medicaid patient with more than 10 ED visits in the Last 12 months is added to the list. The team uses this report daily to engage people in the ED or inpatient and also reach out by phone to offer the program. There is no charge for the services and the team collaborates with the patient’s current care team if they have one.   About **80 percent of eligible patients agree to the service**, and about 20 percent dis-enroll without completing the program. ONE Health served 101 people from April - December of 2018. Seventy-six participants remain active as of December 2018 and 25 people had graduated from the program.  Since 2018, the population of the program has grown to more than 700 patients and the team continues to monitor clients even after graduation to re-engage if a new pattern of instability or crisis emerges.   But its voluntary   The process of moving people toward independence is time-consuming. Sometimes patients keep using the ED.  One of these was Eugene Harris, age forty-five. Harris was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when he was thirteen and dropped out of school. He never went back. Because he never graduated from high school and because of his illness, Harris hasn’t had a steady job. Different family members cared for him for decades, and then a number of them became sick or died. Harris became homeless. He used the Regional One ED thirteen times in the period March–August 2018. Then he enrolled in ONE Health. The hospital secured housing for him, but Harris increased his use of the ED. He said he liked going to the hospital’s ED because “I could always get care.” From September 2018 until June 2019 Harris went to the ED fifty-three times, mostly in the evenings and on weekends, because he was still struggling with his diabetes and was looking for a social connection, Williams says.  Then in June 2019, after many attempts, a social worker on the ONE Health team was able to convince Harris to connect with a behavioral health provider. He began attending a therapy group several times a week. He has stopped using the ED and is on a path to becoming a peer support counselor.  ONE Health clients are 50 years old on average and have three to five chronic conditions.  Social needs are prevalent in the population, with 25 percent experiencing homelessness on admission, 94 percent experiencing food insecurity, 47 percent with complex behavioral health issues, and 42 percent with substance use disorder.
