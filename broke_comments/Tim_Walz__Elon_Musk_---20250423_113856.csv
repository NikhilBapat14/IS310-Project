I nominate him for SpaceX to be the first man (and only) man on Mars.,Evan_802Vines,2025-04-23T14:23:44,10
"Yep, I’m sure his investors are tired of watching everything tank while he’s out destroying peoples lives and pretending to reduce the deficit",Riversmooth,2025-04-23T17:22:41,9
"The feds - whoever's left - ought to keep a close watch on Musk.  Remember DeLorean Motor Company? John DeLorean trying to save his car company?  The feds. Maybe you shouldn't have riled them up. You know, like you did Democrats?",YallerDawg,2025-04-23T11:47:17,7
"IMO, StarLink is the bigger threat. It plays a critical part in military operations by US and other nations.",DeliciousV0id,2025-04-23T12:13:23,6
"Tim Walz isn’t lying!! Musk is attempting to save his ass, while the rest of us are just trying to live our lives. Pay for our groceries, gas and life itself!!   Idgaf if he goes broke but he won’t he’s just as shady and corrupt as tRump is if not worse than him!!",Marianne0819,2025-04-23T13:37:01,8
"I wish I could understand the brain of a narcissist. This guy actually thinks that Tesla is slumping because he’s not involved enough? My dude, the mere mention of your name and stupid ass face has single handedly cut sales by some 13%, and you don’t do jack shit as CEO.   You want to help Tesla? Get out of government, and follow that up by shutting the fuck up for the rest of eternity and maybeee the engineers who do all the actual work there might finally get some credit.",cpatkyanks24,2025-04-23T21:54:31,6

"Exactly the problem. tRump,musk the maga cult members don't care about anyone but themselves.",One_Basil_4921,2025-04-23T16:47:32,4
Does he believe that if he stepped down from DOGE that everyone will just forget about it and start buying his Cyberjunk again.,32lib,2025-04-23T23:21:51,5
I’ll never buy something that musk profits from. He can go to hell. If he were concerned about cutting waste from our country then he should do us all a favor…,Suspicious_Water6180,2025-04-23T23:22:14,3
"He should never have been allowed to touch our government. Hopefully, the Tesla board thinks the same about that company, and he loses both positions at the same time.  We're not that lucky",BluXombie,2025-04-23T23:43:39,2

"Musk is a distraction.  Trump is the one we can stop, if SpaceX and Tesla cease operations tomorrow, Trump will still be trying to defund education, end vaccines, and deport every brown person.  Tesla’s stock is up 55% since this time last year.  GM is up 2% and Ford is down 13%.  Instead of negativity, we need answers for 2026 and 2028.  I’m glad Walz has gotten over November, but I still feel like recovering from that is the only thing that matters.",phxees,2025-04-24T07:16:18,1
"Too late, buddy boy! No one will forget the glee at which you chainsawed through our jobs, spied on our finances, lied about our soc sec money owed us, and went after every necessary safeguard we all depend on. We’re not going to shell out for your financial gain, save your arse from failure since you don’t give an eff about our financial wellbeing.",OptimalRisk7508,2025-04-24T20:56:00,1
Americans should boycott indefinitely!  He needs to go back to his country!  He doesn’t understand or respect American democracy!  He should take his companies and get the F out!,FearlessNectarine20,2025-04-24T21:27:04,1
