"Bill Maher has a history of (quite properly) skewering anyone who he thinks deserves it. I don't agree with a lot of his social views, but the man is open to a lot of varying viewpoints.  Which is honestly more than you could say for many.",squunkyumas,2025-04-17T06:28:01,34
"Maher turned with all of the absurd woke nonsense that took over in 2020 when Biden was elected. Defund the police, pronouns, cancel culture, outrage at everything, speech infringement, etc. He said the Democratic Party became the No Common Sense Party.",Lifeisagreatteacher,2025-04-17T07:16:44,15
