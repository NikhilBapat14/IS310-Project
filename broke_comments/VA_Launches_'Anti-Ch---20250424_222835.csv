War is peace.  Freedom is slavery.  Ignorance is strength.  'Racism and Religious Prejudice' is Meritocracy.  Welcome to the United States of Trump.,Truthisnotallowed,2025-04-24T22:49:31,1

"When i left the Marines many moons ago, I was on some heavy opiates for some combat injuries. When I came home, my local VA refused to give me my meds until I went to some ""substance abuse review"" because I had been on opiates for more than 6 months.   They sent me to some 3rd party clinic thing. I was sitting in the lobby and my then GF (now wife) goes ""this doesn't seem like a doctors office"". I notice, ya, it kinda has a lot of Jesus shit.  I was sent to a spiritual drug rehab place for a review to determine if I should keep getting my medication. Talked to the guy for like 20 minutes, he finally just said ""ya, this isn't the program for you, I'll let them know you're good to go"" and that was that.   I'd be curious to know where this anti Christian bias is, so I can relocate to that Care District",unfinishedtoast3,2025-04-24T23:05:10,1
