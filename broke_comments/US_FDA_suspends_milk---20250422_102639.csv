"Is this the center piece RFK Junior’s master plans to bless the U.S. with herd immunity to the current Bird Flu? He suggests that vaccines for fowl not be developed or used.   Despite recent and ongoing outbreaks leaving to poultry shortages of all kinds farmed birds and eggs, chickens, turkeys, and ducks. Don’t forget game birds. Egg prices made headlines and propaganda from articles about smuggling, to food safety, to tariffs.   In a world without a vaccine this administration has removed safeguards from the study and management of affected wildlife, to the testing for food safety in finished products, to decreasing healthcare….. Culling is drastic and ugly. It’s also the most effective, therefore overall economical method yet proven. Unfortunately strongly in favor of factory farming.  The smaller more humane farms are often family run. The ones that supply the organic, free range produce, and farmers markets. If one small flock of wild ducks fly over or land to catch the same bugs they could leave pollution that destroys their entire business. I’m neither vegetarian nor big consumer of poultry. But there’s such a farm nearby. They focus on raising holiday turkeys. A breed that takes time to mature and maintain their ability to walk and graze wherever they want in rotating swaths of real pastures visible to the country road. While being supplemented with high quality feed. And high quality shelter in which to roost; which they voluntarily return to. These I try to get on the list for early. They offer chickens and sometimes eggs too. That’s as close as it gets to free range without hunting IMO. The source that farmsteads still exist that treat their egg layers and chicks as well as pets; until it’s time for a return on their investment, is me. Then they use, not enjoy, the most humane dispatch. My aunt owned one that supplied the local egg factory. Rooster chicks were well kept separate unless proven troublemakers in mostly happy bachelor flocks. Their only job to gain healthy weight. Better than what happens in factory farms. A lucky few were sold as breeders.                That egg factory stank to high heaven. But it employed people and contributed income that kept families afloat. Shame it’s so outnumbered by automated demand today.  I find it outrageous for our own government to decrease human safety oversight while speeding up the assembly lines. Yet those deregulations have already passed. It’s no comfort that labor laws are permitting school aged children for longer hours has also. Even though there have been headlines and fines over the dangers to children. Especially immigrant children. From the same families that employers are lobbying to get special visa exemptions for. Since so many of the more able-bodied adult breadwinners are laborers sought jobs they feel less likely to attract ICE? End of vent, might’ve gotten a little carried away from my point there; not exactly sorry. Thanks for reading anyway. Any thoughts that aren’t critical of my writing skills? I hope it’s clear that I’m not a bloodthirsty human. I respect life and was raised around farming as a lifestyle. One that had to be as self sustaining as possible. But most often was supported by outside employment of members of the household. Fortunately my family understood why I could never eat from the steer I’d named, bottle fed and curried. But I never felt guilty about giving them the best life (& death) we could offer. Today I try to be careful where I buy and grow as much food as I can. I know very well what a privilege that is and wish everyone had the means.                             Now I really need to let you go before I start rambling about the cuts to aid. Cuts to programs which paid for themselves and benefited all sides. Thanks again for your time Please carry on.",nativerestorations1,2025-04-22T19:49:09,1

That’s the exact reason I stopped drinking milk back when the milk producers fought to have rbhg use not required on labeling ..  just hormones and bad meat practices in general is why I switched to vegan / plant based ..,welding_guy_fromLI,2025-04-22T10:57:43,0
