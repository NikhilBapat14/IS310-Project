"Excerpt:  *The governor urged regulators to protect California’s “enduring dominance in technological innovation.”*  *SACRAMENTO, California — Gov. Gavin Newsom has waded into a bitter fight at California’s privacy agency over proposed automation rules that could have nationwide impacts on everything from hiring to health care.*  *Newsom, in a rare letter to the California Privacy Protection Agency’s five-member board on Wednesday, obtained by POLITICO, urged regulators not to crush the state’s flourishing artificial intelligence sector under onerous regulations — echoing complaints from tech and business groups.*  *“As my office has relayed to Agency staff over the last year, enacting these regulations could create significant unintended consequences and impose substantial costs that threaten California’s enduring dominance in technological innovation,” Newsom wrote.*  *Newsom said he was “pleased” that the board asked CPPA staff earlier this month to exclude generative AI tools from proposed opt-out and risk assessment requirements.*  *“California is home to over half of the world’s top artificial intelligence companies, granting us a unique responsibility to lead in the safe advancement of an industry that has the potential to improve our lives, maintain the state’s economic dominance, and benefit the public good for decades to come,” he wrote.*  *However, CPPA board members remain divided over the proposed regulations. Some, like board chair Jennifer Urban, support passing strong safeguards that grant consumers broad rights to control how automated tools use their data, while others, like Alastair Mactaggart, argue stringent rules could expose the agency to legal threats and undermine its mission.*",DevinGraysonShirk,2025-04-24T11:03:14,1

The democratic party has 3 kinds of voters:  1. centrists 2. Progressives that for for centrists  3. Progressives  I was raised by the 2nd category. It’s beyond frustrating that people believe and agree with every progressive policy but keep voting for centrists.,LongLiveFDR,2025-04-24T12:53:51,1
