">And Trump’s lawsuit comes as Shari Redstone, the head of CBS’ parent company Paramount, is looking to sell it to Skydance Media - a move that would require the blessing from Trump’s FCC.  >“Now, Shari Redstone is the majority owner of Paramount, and she stands to make a fortune if this multibillion-dollar deal, this merger, goes through,” Tapper said. “And it seems as if Shari Redstone is likely to bend the knee to Trump and settle this allegedly frivolous lawsuit.”  >He added: “Hope the money’s worth it, Shari.”  Have to admit I’m surprised by Tapper here.

They're all about the money, and Trump's grip on media continues to amaze me. It's hard to believe, but the fact that Trump is suing ""60 Minutes"" for a staggering $20 billion because of alleged deceptive editing... wow.

His show is basically the same episode each week with new guests where he airs the same twitter grievances but those new guests tend to be good. Sure he also gets some shit birds on their like Ben Shapiro but I welcome Ben coming on and actually having to defend his points of view in an open forum and generally if it’s someone right it’s also someone on the left as well where they call it out for what it is or the conversation is kind of civil. Hearing about the dinner and seeing Steve Bannon come on and Bill just kinda doesn’t go all the way in on the fact this dudes a traitor slimy POS for wanting to change term limits for Trump despite the fact the constitution is rather clear on that was the final straw for me.,el3vader,2025-04-24T00:55:35,1
