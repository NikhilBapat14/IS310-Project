"Eh, deepseek was shown to be a distillation from OpenAI's models; for those that don't understand what that means, in this case it's the method of using a larger and more complex language model  in the role of a teacher to help create and refine a smaller, more efficient model.  When China actually creates something similar without copying most of the work that's already done, we can take them seriously.  You could question deepseek when it came out and it would flat out state that it was created by OpenAI.",programmerOfYeet,2025-04-24T18:42:16,4
"DeepSeek’s success in creating a powerful model that compares favorably to Western AI models while relying on Chinese talent is an “early-warning indicator” for America, according to Hoover Institution fellow [Amy Zegart](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/amy-zegart), in her latest essay with Emerson Johnston titled [*A Deep Peek into DeepSeek AI’s Talent and Implications for US Innovation*](https://www.hoover.org/research/deep-peek-deepseek-ais-talent-and-implications-us-innovation).",HooverInstitution,2025-04-24T17:27:35,1
