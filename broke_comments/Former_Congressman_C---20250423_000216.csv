"Needless to say, the new american is a conspiracy rag. With stories like climate change not being real and how places like Seattle and other left leaning cities being on the verge of collapse because of the liberals running them. They often also cite their own older articles as sources for new articles.",CarbuncleMew,2025-04-23T00:20:51,13

"Am I insane or is it weird they believe 9/11 was an inside job* but they don't ever mention that the Iraq War was based on lies? I mean, it's sort of like, ""Bugs Meany didn't kill Barry Thompson. He did kill Bill Thompson like a year later, though.""  But they hold onto the ridiculous untrue one and ignore the true but just as damning one.  * This article is more that they let it happen but same basic idea.",CT_Phipps-Author,2025-04-23T00:59:13,4

"Nope, it seems not to be.  Why do these clowns want to focus on conspiracy bullshit on something that happened 24 years ago?  They really need to be looking at the current fascist regime.",pj7140,2025-04-23T00:15:30,4
"""Your Honor, I would like to introduce into this case newly-discovered evidence, which is, un fact, the evidence I submitted earlier, but I put these documents into some new files and changed the dates on them to be more favorable to my client. So, as you can clearly see, the plethora of evidence alone here exonerates the defendant from any possibility he committed the crime in question here today, and I, his attorney, find him not guilty.""",justtakeapill,2025-04-23T01:16:34,2

"I'm not referring to this one but in general.  But the New American is the John Birch Society, which is a bunch of Far Right conspiracy theorists and Illuminati-believing nutjobs that talk about secret UN plans to take over the world and Pinochet apologists among other things.",CT_Phipps-Author,2025-04-23T03:04:26,3
