He's isn't deporting people. He is paying another government to disappear people his government kidnapped off the streets in violation of the constitution and everything this country claims to stand for.  Edit: And this is why those sweeping holds from the courts are necessary.  If he is blocked from breaking the law he immediately breaks it in a new way.

"This is probably more legally defensible than the El Salvador cases.  Reading on other sources, he was ordered deportable back in 2021 based on a judge's finding that he had lied on his immigration paperwork.  I think, from reading a couple sources, that he has been in custody since then.  The judge ruled that if he could not be deported back to his home country of Iraq (where he says he would be killed) that he should go to Turkey, where he had been living last outside the US.  However, I do not know whether Turkey would take him since he is not a Turkish national and was found to have terrorist ties by the judge.  It looks like Iraq tried extradite him for criminal charges related to terrorism, and a US federal judge denied that.  He was released from jail but picked up by ICE for possibly lying on his initial immigration paperwork due to the Iraq case showing evidence of ties to terror groups.   The US does have the ability to deport people to other countries if they can't be sent back to their home country.  The biggest difference here from El Salvador is that the arrangement with Rwanda seems to include money for social services, residency documents, and work permits.  This suggests that Ameen will be released to Rwanda out of custody, free to live his life outside the US.  This is WAAAAAAY different than being deported to be held in a torture prison.  If he is being deported to a Rwandan prison its be a whole different thing.  Its scary because its Rwanda and Trump is inherently untrustworthy but a quick scan looks like they may be able to legally justify this. The question remains why he wasn't deported to Turkey, and there may or may not be a legal reason for that.  They held him in custody for 4 years instead of deporting him there already.

"A previous UK government thought sending most irregular migrants to Rwanda (where they pinky promised not to refoul them) along with a bribe refoul to the full cost of accommodating and processing them onshore was a good idea.  However, we have a functional judicial system and no planes ever took off.  I think Israel retired sending asylum seekers there in the past, but the overwhelming majority managed to escape and make their way to the Northern shores of Africa to attempt the Mediterranean crossing into Europe; while they have been known to refoul asylum seekers.  Meanwhile, despite being relatively high on the Human Development Index, they're an surrogacy where criticism of the government is effectively prohibited, and widely suspected of bankrolling and supporting an anti-Hutu militia in the neighbouring DRC (where most of Rwanda's Hutus fled to avoid reprisals for being part of the same tribe as those who committed the genocide over 30 years ago).",mittfh,2025-04-24T01:30:30,2
