Donald Trump is a traitor.,WSMCR,2025-04-14T22:22:30,68
Impeach Trump. Anyone in Congress that supports him must also be impeached and tried for treason. This is getting incredibly serious and fascism is destroying our government.,AdOne5089,2025-04-14T21:28:46,63

"...""and adjudicate his release.""  SCOTUS gave trump's administration 3 days to make this happen. I see zero consequences, however.",Jakesma1999,2025-04-15T00:54:50,13
With no consequences or accountability.   I think the real question that needs to be addressed is how stable was that foundation to begin with for all of this to happen so quickly?,SixOneNiner2113,2025-04-14T20:56:30,16

"there's a lot of misinterpretation surrounding the supreme court ruling. what they ruled is that they won't touch the issue directly because it's the executive branch who handles foreign relations. in fact, they ruled that the lower court had to better define how they expect Trump to facilitate the return of the individual.  the supreme court did NOT rule that Trump has to return the wrongfully deported individual.",qwrtgvbkoteqqsd,2025-04-14T21:38:49,15
Story of the day,JPIZZLE1205,2025-04-14T21:28:10,3
"I actually think there was a lot of slight of hand here - per the NYT, the Supreme Court was actually quite vague and didn't really demand the return of the prisoner :-(  When the Supreme Court handed down its ruling in Mr. Abrego Garcia’s case last week, its findings were complicated and rather ambiguous.  The justices endorsed Judge Xinis’s previous order that required the administration to “facilitate” the return of Mr. Abrego Garcia. But they stopped short of actually ordering his return, indicating that even federal courts may not have the authority to require the executive branch to do so.

Democracy..? there is no more democracy..,GatorNator83,2025-04-15T09:20:52,1
If this isn't enough for people to finally take a stand against this is gonna be a long and scary ride! We need to do something about the traitor in charge.,OkieGuy89,2025-04-15T15:17:24,1
Why doesn’t the court hold someone/anyone in contempt and toss them in jail?,sterlingsplendor,2025-04-15T17:47:07,1
"THEN IMPEACH HIM FOR GOD'S SAKE.  I dont care if you have a minority in the House. Do it! Stop sitting on your hands and tweeting about it.  Go down to the House, kick Jeffries in his ass and tell him to get busy drafting the articles!   Then the House Republicans will have to be on record saying that the SCOTUS rulings do not matter, and therefore, non of their rulings matter.  In which case, abortions for everyone!

"Likely Congress and the courts and the next President will have him forcefully removed.  He’ll think the Secret Service will protect him, but they’ll likely assist with the removal because there’s no way he’s respectful of them.",phxees,2025-04-14T22:12:25,32
"All of Congress will be filled with Trump toadies to a man (on that note, likely exclusively with men) after Trump rigs the elections, then rips up the Constitution (possibility literally) on live TV and declares himself dictator for life.

Those fuckers are the ones that gave trump unlimited power to begin with.,minominino,2025-04-14T21:44:30,13
Have either of them released a statement?,JoviAMP,2025-04-14T21:31:43,5
"Trump knows that the courts don't have any way to actually enforce anything that they rule, SCOTUS included. Especially since Trump has surrounded himself with people so blindly devoted to him that they will kiss his butt after he shoots them in the face and has 1/3rd of the country just as rabidly devoted to him.",immortalfrieza2,2025-04-15T03:59:54,6
"The Republicans have been working behind the scenes for 50 years to undermine  democracy. They started with the schools right after civil rights and women's liberation  by getting rid of civics in school, consistently lowering the requirements to graduate making future voters dumber. Under educated people that can't read don't pay attention to what's going on in politics and therefore just vote for the showiest person who makes the best impression. Plus at the same time they were working to pack the court with conservatives That would accept bribes and vote for anything their donors wanted. We never saw a thing. We were spending too much time trying to make the world better",Beautiful_Reporter50,2025-04-14T21:33:30,13
