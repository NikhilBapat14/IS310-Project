Ah shit here we go again.   Buckle up these comments are going to be unhinged either way you go.,General-Gold-28,2025-04-14T15:39:25,57
I have no problems with making and testing these things as long as the clowns in charge don't shut down the country and try to mandate that I have to have it.,Rush2201,2025-04-14T17:05:56,24
Another vaxx I will never take.,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-14T12:40:08,-10
"Doing some research and it is interesting.  mRNA makes cells produce spike proteins. Well what they neglect to tell you is that these Spike Proteins can just like COVID, affect many organs of the body.  Spike proteins from the SARS-CoV-2 virus can affect multiple organs and biological processes in the body. They can damage lung cells, including pulmonary alveoli and pulmonary endothelial cells, and also harm mitochondria and DNA structures.4 Additionally, spike proteins can damage cardiovascular cells, increase the risk of blood clots, and harm brain cells.4 They can also promote inflammation, suppress immunity, and increase the risk of cancer.4 Furthermore, spike proteins can cause oxidative stress, leading to premature cell death and a hyperoxidized state in the body.  If the Spike Proteins from COVID-19 can affect multiple organs and biological processes, what makes anyone think the the mRNA induced spike proteins couldn't be used to negatively affect your body as well?  Just some logic to consider... and if you see something wrong in my thinking, I am always up for learning more and changing my opinions if I am Wrong.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-14T13:00:14,-9

Where is RFK on this?   mRNA vaccines can infiltrate the blood brain barrier.   No thanks.,Ironman650,2025-04-14T12:43:59,-20
"I think you are partially wrong.  the Covid vaccine is designed to create Covid-spike proteins. I don't think all mrnas will produce ""spike proteins"" because that mechanism wouldn't make sense for every infectious target.  It is like saying salt adds flavor to your food. So adding black pepper is just another form of salt. Nah, they are both flavor-enhancers but they can work in different ways.",QuietRedditorATX,2025-04-14T13:03:10,67
"Fresh off the presses... he has a LOT on his plate. Hopefully he will get around to it.  I am 58, never had a flu shot, had it as a kid a couple times before I was 5. Have not had the Flu since.  Had COVID in Jan 2020, 4 days, no hospital and was fine, no taste issues or such.  Last surgery 6 months ago, they wanted me to get a shot, I said test my blood, STILL have tons of NATURAL antibodies.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-14T12:47:44,-13
"Yes the COVID vaxx was specifically designed to fight covid. I never said it was for anything else.  BUT based on what I have been reading, it would not take much to make an mRNA that would harm the body, OR add some extra to an existing vaxx to do it.  Example if you add the wrong salt, like mixing rock salt with regular salt, you would get the flavor and also negative affects.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-14T14:01:28,-4

Sorry to hear that. I know a few people who have had very negative side effects from the Vaxxes.,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-14T14:02:48,7
"My wife due to her job as a Surgical Tech in a Hospital was FORCED to get the Vaxx.  Thankfully she was able to get the NON-mRNA vaxx from Johnson and Johnson, which had a lot fewer adverse side effects and she didn't seem to get any.  I guess there was a reason they pushed the mRNAs over the Johnson and Johnson one.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-14T14:07:16,3
J&J had some of the more severe side effects that it had to be recalled in several countries.  https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/coronavirus-vaccine-blood-clots,QuietRedditorATX,2025-04-14T14:19:51,42
"I got J&J jabbed.  I got chills for 48 hours after having taken the shot.  Then every month or 2 I'd get the same chills randomly.  They've tapered off, in both frequency and length.  Only had one instance this year, thankfully.   I took the shot to keep my job.  I'd give my job up in an instant if I knew the consequences. But at least I'm still employed. Lucky me?",u2sarajevo,2025-04-14T14:20:58,-2
"That was my wife's dilemma, get the shot or get fired.  THEN a month later was when the mandatory shots were cancelled.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-14T14:30:24,3
