"Without subsidies, tax credits, R&D grants, training and education funding in an American Manufacturing bill to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 5-10 years, his trade policy can’t be justified. It’s just a stupid move that will cripple American business.  Tariffs are useful if you have an existing manufacturing infrastructure that you want to encourage buying from, but we have that for barely anything, and practically nothing where all components are produced and sourced in the US.

"Great question. This is the problem with ""bringing back manufacturing"": if you're going to invest in a brand-new factory, you're gonna build the most advanced factory you can afford, not only for efficiency but also to keep your labor costs down.   This means jobs will come back, but measured in the thousands, not tens or hundreds of thousands. This also means the under-educated -- who turned out massively for Trump -- won't benefit tremendously from the return of manufacturing.  What worries me is these factories will need more energy, and with the anti-green energy movement in power, that means more demand on fossil fuels, higher energy costs for consumers, and unless municipalities are allowed to tax these factories, minimal benefit to the country.",ZanzerFineSuits,2025-04-15T16:36:22,48

"Basically you won’t get jobs because it’s all automated, it will take a decade at least to even make a dent in the trade deficit because it’s not just factories it’s the entire supply chain that has to get altered, China can hold out for a long time, so there’s really no reality to tariffs. Countries probably could avoid even going to him for deals because the companies aren’t going to start selling in the US overnight.

"Large scale manufacturing is just not coming back to the united states. period. the logistics and trade routes have all been carved out. global trade operates on razor thin margin that is only profitable at the macro scale. the infrastructure involved is in the hundreds of billions, if not trillions of dollars. if you force businesses to choose between creating an entirely new trade network from scratch or paying insane tariffs, they're going to just choose neither and just stop doing business in the US.      like it's obviously a super silly anecdotal example, but look at the Switch 2 rollout. the cost to set up a US based manufacturing system is completely impossible. all the parts are made in asia, so you would either need to then also move manufacturing of those parts to the US or pay exorbitant tarriffs anyway... if you can even get the parts shipped here because developing trade networks takes years to fully create.  so then your only real option is, will american consumers stomach paying 1000 dollars for a switch? and even if they are, what benefit did we get out of it???",gonz4dieg,2025-04-15T17:01:17,8
"it’s dumb, because the tariffs would also raise the price of raw materials and machinery needed to build the factories.   the right way is to use incentives, tax breaks and subsidies to get more manufacturing in the U.S. And we would want to target high tech industry, national safety and high pay.   bringing back washing machines, tvs and plastics is very misguided.

"Trump’s *explicit* goals are to reduce US trade and lower US wages.   No, his tariffs can’t be justified. The level of damage they will do to the US is incalculable.  We will have higher unemployment, not lower. We will have lower wages, not higher. American wealth will be squandered in ways that people simply cannot comprehend.  Trump is trying to brute force his way into turning back time. He is trying to invest in dying industries like coal and divest from growing industries like solar, because he stopped learning in the 1980s.    Like every economist and economic institution has repeatedly said, this won’t work. It is stupid to even try.  Most Americans don’t want a factory job, especially not one that pays low enough to compete with foreign sweatshops. And forcing it on us will make us poorer and weaker.

The first things you notice was (1) there were no POCs working there in 1920 and (2) how few employees there were in 2007 v 1920. Yet they produced three times as much ice cream at a third of the cost.   There are your lost manufacturing jobs. Now the factory employed a lot more engineers, IT people, and logistics personnel, but these were not low skilled jobs. Heck, these guys even automated the labeling and boxing of the product.

"Man I wish I still had the numbers handy, but some rough numbers from the 60s and 70s to today:  Cars sales are roughly about the same now as they were in the 60s and 70s, something like 15 million cars a year. Cars last longer, so people buy them less often. So even in a world where all car manufacturing stayed in the US, there'd be no growth.  What makes that worse is population has grown 50 to 60% more since 60s/70s. So as a percentage, it's dropped.  Additionally manufacturing has improved to the point where there's 3 to 4 times as many cars produced per worker. So in the hypothetical world where manufacturing stayed in the US (and let's say foreign auto makers moved their manufacturing here), there would still be job losses. Best case scenario is less backfilling for retirement, worse case scenario is layoffs.  Additionally, let's go with the argument of ""but at least those jobs would be American workers"", yeah, I'm not against that idea I'm general, but that means  cars will cost more. So that would also have some impact on the economy (cost of living is increased, people keep cars longer [less auto sales...].

"Labor is too expensive in the United States, the only way manufacturing and production will be competitive here is through mass automation. This would involve a few workers at floor level to oversee things, but most of the overseeing would be in the control room where the process is controlled. You'd need skilled technicians to work on the equipment and machinery but a lot of plants want this head count to a minimum as well.  But even then it takes time to iron out all the kinks in your production process, find the necessary staffing with the needed skill sets, having the machinery needed available, etc. It is a capital and time intensive endeavor to embark on re-domesticating manufacturing.  Look at Craftsman. They opened up a large facility in Texas and then closed down like 18 months later.   We don't have a work force trained for these types of jobs, our education system does not equip people for these types of jobs either, we are a service based economy with high paying, high skill jobs.   The government would need to foster an environment where this is profitable, so subsidies and tax credits are probably necessary as well. We are talking about a monumental take here, it'll take decades and it'll cost a lot of money. And businesses will not devote this time and capital unless they know this is how it will be for the long term.

"I don't know if it would be better to have manufacturing in the US when automation is possible.   I don't thinkt that's Trumps plan at all tho, and if it is, it's weird because he's not helping it at all.  Firstly his constant changes in tariffs does not give any insentive to build in The US. What sane person would invest in building manufacturing in The US, based on tariffs that they have no idea are permanent or not? They invest billions, and then tariffs are gone and they suddently can't compete with chinese prices again? Obviously the US can't have all of these tariffs long term, so which ones will go?  Secondly it takes years and years to build. They calculated that it would take 300 billion and 3 years, if I remember right, to move 10% of apples production to The US. How would it look if The US were to move all sorts of manufacturing to The US? What are people going to do for those 15 years with insane prices before they actually have substitutes produced in The US?   Tariffs are used in many countries to help domestoc production, but often that's not for economic gain. For example in Norway, we have tariffs on imported vegtables to help farmers in Norway having a competetive price. But that's not enough, the farmers also need money from the government. And the reason for this is safety, if there's a war or another issue, atleast we are producing some food in our own country.

"As a concept, bringing high skill jobs back home is a good policy, because automation isn’t ever what most people think of it.  For manufacturing the automation costs a lot to buy, a lot to maintain, and you spend a lot on the people who operate it. So it works for a lot of applications but not for others.  Like there is a lot of automation in making cars, but there are over 1.7 million people in the USA who work in making cars, and 10.1 million people work in support of that industry.

"Clothes manufacturing was at the tip of the industrial revolution in the 18th century. My own family moved from farming to weaving in that era before moving to the US. The clothes manufacturing slowly drifted away during the 19th century, moving to the US, Japan and now is mostly in South East Asia.   All this happened in the tariffs era despite laws designed to prevent this kind of development.   While laws can influence and even protect certain industries, they can't change the basic trajectory of innovation. It will just happen somewhere else. The problem is that this protection comes with a price: it delays the structural changes that need to happen with the result that the country falls behind even more than it would otherwise. Both Japan and China are great examples of what happens if you actually succeed in locking the country down. China which was leading over Europe in so many categories ended up traumatized by its occupation of said European countries at the close of the 19th century. Japan had managed to keep out fire weapons for almost 400 years just to be forcefully opened by the US in the mid 19th century.   It's not that tariffs might not work - it would require more commitment than only Trump, though - but it would be to the long term detriment of the country. The US would no longer lead the charge but be racing to catch up with the others.   The other problem is a purely practical issue: the level of automation required for a US based production to succeed in a heads on competition is ludicrous. The average income difference between the US and China is 430%. This means in order to be competitive, automation must create a productivity in the order of 4 to be competitive. While some products may already work at lower entry levels, for many things 150% tariffs are far away from being enough. It's still more economic to produce in China and just raise prices.   The question is what the next move is. Trump has mentioned his intent to do away with income tax and whatever DOGE is doing will lead to people expecting this -  so this might be the next move. In that case, it would create some incentive to build new manufacturing sites where technology, market differentiation, economies of scale and distance provide enough edge in combination with the 150% tariffs actually make sense. It's going to be far away from 50s era employment though.  In the meantime people will be stuck with being taxed twice, first on their income, then on the tariffs.",YetAnotherGuy2,2025-04-15T18:46:32,1

I believe this is his manufacturing romanticism. He has held these beliefs from way back. But you never know. If the pull of US is strong enough that it cannot be offset by other markets, it might happen. But I believe there has to be a certain stability in policy for that. If today it's 54%, then later it's 125 or 145%, it is not a stable policy. Recently, smartphones and electronic devices are exempt. I think such moves only add to the unpredictability, which doesn't incentivise companies to plan. I would say if he wants to have tariffs, put a stable amount, and then let it be for a while. But again, I see this hurting the small to medium scale businesses who are dependent on manufacturing in China or other countries with cheap labor and easy access to raw materials. They cannot afford to bring the manufacturing here, and so they would probably go bust (I hope I am wrong about them).

"I work in plant automation.  I build control systems (HMI and Autonomous Processing Solutions).  Manufacturing is moving to robotic assembly and functional checking.  Very few humans are involved in actual manufacturing or processing.  Human involvement primarily involves staging input materials, packaging, and plant maintenance.   The notion of ""skilled overseers"" is not how the systems progress.  Not all manufacturing is desirable to move back to the us.  Some manufacturing processes have undesirable waste products and hazardous processes in the process itself.  For example, you don't want chemical or heavy metal processing here.  The by-products can be disastrous.  You want high-value/critical dependency products, such as chips, specialized machinery parts, and some specialized machinery.  Returning these processes will greatly increase costs because of labor expense, environmental regulation, and infrastructure development.  The bottom line is that we should take back some of it, and some should be left where they are.  Criticality to the market should dictate manufacturing location, not jobs, regarding the concern about automation supplanting jobs.  Don't worry.  Two things are happening right now.  Even with all the layoffs, the labor pool is shrinking.  Birth rates and immigration are working in conjunction to lower the force.  Second, automation always moves personnel to a higher state of yield.

There is no 'there there' with that analysis.    Anyone skilled to maintain and monitor automated manufacturing is already doing so right now.  This is not going to be a big industry but something more in line with Facebook and Google.  Relatively few employees relative to market cap.  This ties up capital that could otherwise fund businesses that actually would create jobs that people can take.  Another problem with your assertion is that the type of person being left out of the economy is STILL left out of the economy by any level of modern manufacturing created in the United States.  Notice I said 'created' and not 'brought'.

"Everyone focuses on bringing ""manufacturing"" back to the United States as if it's some kind of magic spell. Manufacturing jobs aren't what we need. What we need are **good paying** jobs, with **low entry requirements**.  In the *past*, manufacturing jobs met these two criteria. But they did so under different economic conditions than what we have today. If we created 100,000 manufacturing jobs in Alabama tomorrow, what prevents those jobs from paying the minimum wage?  If the goal is to bring wages up, there are two general ways to do that. One is to make the labor market as tight as possible. If there are more jobs available than workers to fill those jobs, employers have to compete by raising wages or lowering requirements. ""Making the labor market tight"" is not exactly as easy as flipping a switch, but a variety of policies can nudge things in that direction (and tariffs is not one of them).  The other way to bring wages up is through artificial floors, such as the minimum wage or widespread labor union participation. This is more straightforward in a policy sense.  Both of these options have inflationary effects on the economy, but commenting on why that's ""a good thing actually"" would be a different post.",Piriper0,2025-04-18T01:08:34,1
"Im actually pro tariffs. The issue is the comically large amount of tariffs and the lack of room for bargaining or compromising. Foreign nations understand we need to do what is best for our people, they will often happily open up factories over here, it is only a bonus to them to cut shipping costs anyway. The issue is the hostility behind the tariffs, they're an obvious attack, not orchestrated to help American people get jobs.      We need to invest in developing industrial facilities that are modern, not slave labor, and create programs for people to be effective at these jobs. We have a lot of computer science graduates but we are seeing the demand is low, this could be a solution.    Additionally, we could also create programs in Mexico to create factory jobs, which is great because it helps with illegal immigration, saves shipping costs, and we abolish dependency on a cold War adversary. We could totally say we have a truce with Canada and Mexico and if you make any foreign product not made on North American soil, tariffs, but we don't. Expanding north American business benefits all of America, especially the US. Shipping costs and time is devastating to business and finding ways to cut that while also creating jobs and fortifying orderly immigration is a huge win for us. Honestly, Mexico doesn't have to cost that much than China either for factory work, so we might see a lot of savings depending on how it is gone about.        I don't believe Trump has intent to do anything but Brexit us apart. It is shocking how all these foreign countries act like they don't know what is happening and shoot themselves in the foot as a petty revenge attack. We are a massive consumer nation and to pretend they don't need us is laughable. you never did, you just wanted money, and you still do, so let's stop making it about the country and make it about Trump.

Who processes almost 90% of all rare earth minerals on the market and 99.9% of the really important ones like dysprosium? CHINA.  So at best, Trump's trade policy jacks up the cost of building those automated manufacturing facilities. That makes companies less inclined to build in the US, not more.  In reality, China isn't Naru. They are a nuclear power with their own aircraft carriers. The US does not have a big military stick with China. They can retaliate without worrying that the US will send a peace keeping force or finance a coup. What do you know? One of the first things they did was put an export curb on those minerals we need to build the robots to automate the plants.  Even if Trump uses all the tariff revenue to subsidize building these manufacturing facilities, it won't matter because we won't be able to get the materials needed.  His trade policy is dumb.

I don't know how they would hold up to the 2000's and on outsourcing of service industry jobs (call centers and customer service lines, software, etc.), although a lot of that has been automated with robocalls and automated menus.   I don't expect you to take my word for it, but you will have to do your own digging on this one.",BluesSuedeClues,2025-04-16T15:28:09,6
"Personal confirmation: A friend opened a food manufacturing plant, and the first NON-automated ""assembly line"" from flour to dough to finished product being put in boxes ready for shipping to restaurants, required between 10 and 15 people for all the steps. Most were unskilled and non-white workers, which he hated. Yeah, a Republican.  Fast forward a couple years later, I tour his plant again and there are 3 completely automated assembly lines, but only 3 people per line (9 total) despite the 2X increased production. They just roamed up and down the lines, checking for jams or other problems. No special skills needed, as any actual problems were addressed by an onsite tech.  He's now up to 8 lines in two buildings, everything automated.",Vet_Racer,2025-04-17T13:25:39,4
"**A** plan from Honda leaked to the Japanese press, but it's not immediately clear if it's the actual plan Honda has, or if it's just one part of their corporate planning. At least at the moment they don't appear to plan to cancel any of their existing development outside of the US, though it's possible they will *also* expand manufacturing in the US.

What makes you think that would happen. There is zero reason to think that. About 15-20% of exports (not total production) goes to the US. Domestic and other nations will pick up some slack when prices decrease.,2053_Traveler,2025-04-16T15:43:20,1

"There's nothing inherent to heavy manufacturing that makes it pay well and have good benefits: you only have to look at heavy manufacturing elsewhere in the world to see it. What makes a job have good pay and good benefits is a combination of a strong labour movement, and a greater culture that doesn't consider accumulating wealth a moral positive in and of itself. You want to solve the wealth gap, the deficit, Social Security insolvency, the whole shebang? Stop expecting capitalists to make your life better out of the goodness of their hearts. You don't even have to go full communist, or even really socialist, you just need to a) back unions and make it easy to found them and b) shame rapaciously greedy capitalists that buy themselves multi-billion dollar yachts and won't even let their workers stop long enough to take a piss break. You're not going to see something like the Bethlehem steel mill coming back, where hundreds of thousands of people work at one plant. You're going to see things closer to the Chinese Dark Factories that are so fully automated that they don't even keep the lights on except for the few hours a day when maintenance is working or engineers are spinning up the plant for the day. If you want that mid-century good life back, unionize the service industry to the same degree that the manufacturing industry was unionized, and when someone tells you that the fact that Jeff Bezos makes thousands more than his lowest paid employee is a sign of his brilliance and hard work? Punch them directly in the face.",VodkaBeatsCube,2025-04-16T08:41:09,2

"Yeah,  we may feel some pain, and if we have to cover the farmers for a short time, so be it.  Whatever the cost, it's worth it to get the country turned around. What we've been doing the last 30 years isn't sustainable and something had to change. It should've happened years ago, but no president had the courage to do it because of politics. Trump could've taken the easy route and keep taking us down the wrong road, default on the dept, let SS run out, etc. but he didn't.

"It’s not short term, it’s as long as you block trade. Either you keep giving them $20-30 billions every year or they essentially go bankrupt . You loose farming but bring back what exactly? Auto industry? Will that create as many jobs as farming?  I agree that maybe we need some protections and stimulus but that’s why we need better infrastructure and subsidies and tax cuts for some industries. Just google the history of tariffs - those are very bad for economy. Even if plants are built here THEY NEED TRADE.",joan_goodman,2025-04-19T18:02:25,1
"I disagree that tariffs are bad for the economy.  Btw, Google will direct you to one side of the argument, which is why I choose not to use it unless I'm looking up something that's not political at all. We don't know if it's short-term or not yet, and it's only been a couple of months. Also, I have friends in the farming industry, and there aren't as many full-time farmers as you might think. A lot of the farming process doesn't require many people at all, and tractors even drive themselves nowadays.   Trumps tariffs aren't meant to be permanent and they're not meant to stop trading completely either. They're meant to bring countries to the negotiating table, and so far, it seems to be working very well. Of course,  China is the exception, but they'll have to give in eventually. They don't do so great without the US.",XXXCincinnatusXXX,2025-04-20T06:47:56,1
