"This is incredible.    The fact they are now at 25% confidence is astounding.  It should be 0%.    They kept Joe in the basement until it came time for re-election, at which point the obvious progression of his condition couldn't be hidden any longer.  Once the absolute meltdown ensued in front of the entire country, they replaced him with perhaps the only living person so unlikable they were a downgrade from Biden as a candidate. After this they spent well over a billion dollars on a campaign focused on how bad Donald Trump was, not what they could do to make the country better.    Then they lost to Donald Trump....again.    The finger pointing and refusal to accept reality that has ensued is evidence of zero direction.  The only drive is to be the antithesis of Trump, which has gotten them behind criminals and terrorists.  Furthermore, they refuse to back up when clearly screwing the pooch or return to a sane center.  Donald Trump has broken them completely.    Biden might truly poll better going forward than any candidate they could put out there, and Joe's condition is so advanced he may wake up tomorrow believing he is Frank Sinatra and he needs to do things his way.    The fact 25% of their constituency can have confidence in the leadership who delivered that is just amazing to me.",Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-04-18T22:30:12,23
">Confidence in Democratic congressional leadership plummeted to an all-time low of 25%, according to a new poll.  >The Gallup poll conducted between April 1-14 and released Thursday found that the confidence rating sunk nine points below the previous low-water mark for Democrats – 34% – which was recorded in 2023.  >The current rating is also well below the 45% average confidence level that Americans have had in Democratic congressional leadership since 2001.   It's so marvelous. They really think screaming at the rain is going to help, too.  All this running around, worrying about people who absolutely deserve to be deported, demanding that the party shift further left, constantly crying about Elon - the meltdown is wild to witness.",squunkyumas,2025-04-18T19:03:25,27

"I'm sure you've noticed that anything that is related to politics with the left right now, they always say ""We have to focus on what makes us win elections."" and not ""What can we do for our constituents""    They've completely lost the plot some time ago, and now it's come home to roost.",Sangmund_Froid,2025-04-19T10:50:10,5

Has she paid off all the celebrities she stiffed for their endorsements yet? Funny there is no record of trump paying celebrities to endorse him. I guess any that did actually believed in him. No one believed if the hyena much.,ILikestoshare,2025-04-19T13:31:54,3

"I agree with your premise, but the reality is they could screw up a ham sandwich.  It doesn't take a noble scholar to know they had a losing message in 2024 and somehow their message is degrading even from there.  I'd say they were only focused on winning, except they aren't winning.  So the focus is ""how do we mistake activity with accomplishment?"".  Enter more TDS.",Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-04-19T10:55:02,2
"No doubt.    The only strategy they know is doubling down. Since the left has no real message that anyone with a sane mind would agree with; the only effective methods they have are to appeal to emotion. Unfortunately, appealing to sympathy, anger and greed have worked outstandingly for them for a long time. It's failure now has them shook to the foundations...they just don't know what to do at all.    Kinda just how it goes when you have nothing of value to say and your appeal to emotion fails. All they can do is double down.",Sangmund_Froid,2025-04-19T10:57:51,3
