"Well, this man did commit a crime. Okay, let's see what he did...  >In July 2022, Mr. Harsono was charged with destruction of property for drawing graffiti on four trailers that belonged to a food company.  >Repairing the damage cost less than $500, a court document said. Mr. Harsono pleaded guilty to misdemeanor destruction of property and agreed to pay $485, which included a fine and court fees, records showed.  >Speaking on the phone from Kandiyohi County Jail, roughly 95 miles west of Minneapolis, Mr. Harsono said he was remorseful about what he had done. He said that he loved painting murals and had a lifelong passion for street art, and had wrongly presumed that the trailers were abandoned.  ...That's it?! Really? He deserves to have his life upended and his family torn apart over some graffiti?? Our own president committed at least 34 felonies and received no punishment and is now in the highest office in the country. But graffiti is unforgivable?? Wow.",sachiprecious,2025-04-23T19:56:41,28

"Even so, he probably shouldn’t have done that and just laid low, given that he was hoping for a Green Card. A 34-year old man tagging company trailers?? Lame. Doesn’t deserve to have his Visa revoked and life upended, and definitely not deported, but still, pretty freakin’ stupid, IMO.",icecreemsamwich,2025-04-24T00:20:54,-3
