"Unless one of the parents is a citizen/legal immigrant already, this should not be allowed. Unless there is evidence the marriage/relationship was a fraud for citizenship of course. Citizenship is for legal residents and their kids only.",Xander_hades_,2025-04-18T09:16:05,10
Stop anchor babies and rogue judges would be a double win.Â ,Long_Jelly_9557,2025-04-17T14:22:50,67
"Birthright citizenship was meant to grant rights to freed slaves, not to the children of millions of illegal immigrants brought in by a puppet with dementia.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-17T14:06:36,54
This Supreme Court will never shut down anchor baby birthright citizenship. It's all part of their grand plan.,jcr2022,2025-04-18T00:44:04,4
"this is  not about birthright citizenship but when nationwide injunctions should be used  unless the admin comes up with new arguments so stunning and self apparent that the justices are blown away...i suspect they will not stay the injunctions , and let the cases percolate through lower courts.  unless it looks like an extremely  very clear win for birthright citizenship..they will not stay.",SerendipitySue,2025-04-17T17:28:38,6
The nationwide injunction thing is going to become an arms race if they don't pull it back.   Trump is going to appoint me to a federal court and I'll uphold all of his immigration actions and file nationwide injunctions against everything remotely left of Ronald Reagan,hiricinee,2025-04-17T18:10:46,-7
"I hate to be that guy.  Anchor babies have been a decades long issue for the USA.  This is not just a Biden administration issue.  Sure, it has been vastly exacerbated over the last 4 years, but birthing tourism has been a thing in this country since at least the late 1980's.  And no, I'm not a fan of birthright citizenship.  My first inclination for qualifying for citizenship falls a little more on the Starship Troopers side of things.",WreknarTemper,2025-04-17T15:43:42,49
"It didn't even originally give citizenship to Native Americans, because they weren't subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Native Americans didn't get birthright citizenship until 1924 and it was controversial among both whites and natives.",Mountain_Man_88,2025-04-17T15:03:31,36
