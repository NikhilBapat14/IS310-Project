"Tell NIMBYs to shut the hell up. Change the zoning laws. Let builders make money building housing. Done.    >  > Lawmakers have introduced ambitious bills that would, for housing developments in existing neighborhoods, blow a hole through the longstanding thicket of environmental reviews and regulations that often slow down projects and add costs. ***One of those passed its first committee on Monday***. >  > Still, YIMBY-ism hit a stumbling block Tuesday in the form of the Senate housing committee. The committee, led by Sen. Aisha Wahab, nearly killed a closely watched bill to require cities to allow taller, denser apartments and condo construction near public transit stations.  >  > Wahab said she was acting on a chorus of familiar objections from progressives and others who have long delayed housing construction in California: The legislation didn’t guarantee that projects would be built with union labor. It didn’t require that the new units be affordable for low-income residents. It could infringe on local governments’ ability to block or green-light projects. It opened up the possibility of bypassing certain environmental reviews.  >  > In the end, the committee voted 6-2 against Wahab’s objections to narrowly advance Senate Bill 79, by Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat and prominent advocate for housing production. ***Some Democrats were absent or didn’t vote***.   I'll repeat,  ***Some Democrats were absent or didn’t vote*** >  > It is a narrower revival of a proposal Wiener tried before. In 2018, he introduced legislation to allow taller, denser buildings around major transit stops, overriding local zoning rules and the objections of local governments. It died in committee. In 2020, he took another crack at the issue. That bill was silently axed by the Senate’s appropriations chair. >  > In unusually frank comments as he presented the bill on Tuesday, Wiener said Wahab had not offered any amendments to the legislation — ***only blanket opposition*** — and criticized the analysis prepared by the committee’s staff, who work under Wahab’s leadership.",tech57,2025-04-23T09:51:55,29

"We have too many regulations that make it de jure (and/or de facto) illegal to build enough housing in too many places!  We also have a recognized housing shortage which is the main driver of the affordability crisis.  Deregulation isn't *always* a bad thing.  By itself I would agree it is insufficient to completely address the housing crisis, but some amount of it is necessary.",SpaceElevatorMusic,2025-04-23T09:19:12,19
"But they have a point on two things that are a priority for me: housing and public transit. I’m not a huge fan of deregulation, but mindless regulation without a purpose definitely would make things more expensive. The mindless regulation I see only makes the rich richer and everyone else poorer. Maybe if you already own a place or are in some affordable housing situation, sit this argument out.   It’s not anti left to reduce needless burdens on capitalism. Capitalism has big flaws, but it also has some benefits. I think mindless restrictions just sort of removes those few benefits of capitalism so you are left with no positives. There is no reason why multi family housing shouldn’t be permitted everywhere as long as it’s not in an industrial zone. SFO zoning is more harmful to the environment than non SFO zoning since it just causes sprawl and forces people to use cars. There is no reason to mandate parking minimums, because natural market demand will create those parking spaces. Additionally, you are subsidizing a more harmful transit system at the expense of public transit by doing so.   Building high speed rail in California is more environmentally friendly, atleast compared with farms, vehicles, planes, etc. HSR should be held up by environmental reviews. Additionally, the second avenue subway had pointless labor requirements such as multiple union employees always being present to run specific machines when only one was needed.   I want left wing public alternatives where the government is literally building again, but I’ll also make it so the private market can operate more efficiently in this case since there really is no negative impact.",JPenniman,2025-04-23T09:27:21,6

I disagree. I think they both have poor housing plans. The $25k for new home buyers would just raise the cost of starter homes by $25k. This has shown to happen again and again. It only benefits people who already have assets; not the people trying to gain access to them. I did like the part of Harris’ plan that included building up in cities.  Opening up more land for single family housing would just worsen traffic and increase commute times.,RiceStickers,2025-04-24T11:48:18,0

"I’m an abundance person who desperately wants more housing in CA and I have 3 responses:  First, even if you’re 100% right, I think you should still support the deregulation. Right now, I, and many others, think you’re wrong about where the bottleneck is. However, if all the governmental barriers to new infill housing disappear and blackrock buys them all up and housing prices keep on their current trend, then I’ll admit my error, reconsider  my position, and start backing the laws you propose.  Second, even if you’re 100% right, I don’t see how the deregulation would be a disaster. Suppose blackrock does buy up all the new housing. They’ll be spending money locally, which will benefit the local economy and then paying property taxes to local municipalities which can fund more of the services that you and I both want to provide. If the homes are empty then there won’t be any new people competing for those services and they go completely towards current residents. Win-win.  Third, suppose that you are wrong - deregulation happens, more housing gets built, and prices go down. Surely you admit that there’s a greater-than-zero chance that this is the case? So as I see it, there's only upside to deregulating and no downside. Worst case scenario seems to be that blackrock transfers money to developers, but even then, there are positive local externalities.",crossingtides,2025-04-23T12:12:49,14
"Literally it’s not all black rock and big companies. You have no evidence for that. I’ll give you an example, in rural towns of nh, housing is very expensive while land is abundant. Why can’t somebody buy a half acre from somebody else and just build a house? Why does it have to be illegal? Black rock on the other hand can buy all the land not designated for housing and lobby the local government for changes and then build.

I want them to make government more effective as well, but I don’t see how their agenda harms a left wing agenda at all. You better be screaming at the top of your lungs for government to start buying up properties and building dense coops and public housing, because that’s the lefts vision (one I also agree with). However, I’m sure you believe it all just a conspiracy and that housing is unaffordable only because of black rock withholding units from the market. If so, let me introduce you to land value taxes which we can impose on all land forcing everyone to sell their land/property if they are not utilizing it efficiently. One idea I’m more than happy to try is every solution at the same idea. Whatever you want to target black rock we can do alongside Publix housing and liberalizing zoning restrictions. This way, no matter what, the housing crisis is resolved instead of waiting a decade to measure if we were right in diagnosing it. I’d recommend thinking seriously about supply and demand as well as how the government can act as an agent to select winners or losers (this case the wealthy landlords are the winners) through regulations themselves.
