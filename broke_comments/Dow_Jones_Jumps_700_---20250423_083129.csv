Time for another pump in the pump and dump cycle apparently.,Deinosoar,2025-04-23T08:32:27,31
"We need Republicans off the levers of power for the 50 years of progress they've undone.  It could take that long for the US to be credible again.  It's not just maga, it's the Republicans since the tea party, and billionaires like musk, bezos, zuckerberg, and companies like target, Walmart, etc.  Not to mention the scotus.",Ydeas,2025-04-23T08:37:02,15
I keep reminding people that nothing has changed and these are still just words but it doesn't do anything anymore¬†   How many times can we do this pump and dump cycle?   People have the memory of goldfish. The tariffs are still in place,AssociateGreat2350,2025-04-23T08:42:09,11

He‚Äôs folding after accomplishing absolutely nothing for the US except for likely damaging our economic standing in the world and vital national security relationships. This is the dumbest self own I‚Äôve ever seen and it‚Äôs *still* probably the best we can hope for from this administration.,Orbitingkittenfarm,2025-04-23T08:49:25,3

"Many Americans are in the market via their 401K retirement vehicles and they can't just opt of of the market that easily. So there are thousands of fund managers who are going to still pump money into the market and attempt to make their portfolios grow.   They try to say the fundamentals haven't changed so get back in there and get some of those bargain stocks!  But the fundamentals *have* changed. The reputation of the US as a reliable and stable trading partner is gone and that is a foundational piece of the American economy. That reputation can't just bounce back, it takes decades to build a good reputation.",MangroveWarbler,2025-04-23T09:32:31,3
"Definitely. Many of those who live by the market are coping hard right now, thinking ""OK, the downturn is over, everyone get back in the pool so I can keep making money!""  But the harsh reality is that businesses can't plan with this amount of uncertainty. Not only that but global businesses can't rely on US markets to be stable anymore so they are routing around the US as much as they can.   Many international customers that the US is losing now, especially in the food sector, are never coming back. Canadian businesses won't be coming back for quite some time.  Sure it's easy to take a baseball bat to a TV, but putting it back together again is a much more difficult task. This is a lesson the dipshits have to learn the hard way. I just wish they could learn it without dragging us along with them.",MangroveWarbler,2025-04-23T09:26:01,6
