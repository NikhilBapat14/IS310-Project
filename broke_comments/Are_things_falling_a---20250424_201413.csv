That tends to happen when you implement an agenda almost tailor made to tick off anyone who isn't either wealthy or racist.   Politics runs on goodwill. If you run that into the ground it's only a matter of time until you're fighting battles on all fronts.,NoCoolNameMatt,2025-04-24T20:27:36,1

I dunno. I don't trust WaPo to be honest with me so it's hard to say.,Grandpa_No,2025-04-24T20:37:22,1
Absolutely this. I’ve seen so many subs recently that have nothing to do with politics but are being forced to cause of some cancellations or something. Sure he has a massive cult but the majority of Americans just want to tune out politics and now everything they are doing is being hurt.,UncannyCharlatan,2025-04-24T20:29:12,1

He's a fascist dictator of course public opinion won't constrain him.  He has been in office less then 100 days and has managed to fuck up the entire government and our countries standing with the entire world. He's got at least four years more of this shit to go.,Trump_sucks_d,2025-04-24T21:08:28,1
Maybe people will stop tuning out politics now?  The main thing authoritarian regimes don't want the population talking about is politics. The majority of Americans seem to have obeyed in advance on that one.,ResignedFate,2025-04-24T21:10:06,1
