"These words spoken by the angel - ""He is not here; he has risen, just as he said"" - are the most comforting words ever spoken by anyone other than our Lord Himself. Announcing that He has kept His word through this most extraordinary sign gives us the assurance that He will keep His word for us. He is risen, just as He said. Our sins are forgiven, just as He said. We will rise from the dead at His coming, just as He said. Alleluia, Christ is risen.",awksomepenguin,2025-04-20T21:35:56,2

"While Iâ€™m personally not a fan of depictions of Christ with womanly long hair and physically like a milque-toast dude with barely any muscle on Him (He was a carpenterâ€™s son and thus grew up knowing hard work without any power tools, which would take plenty of muscle grease to do, and He Himself inspired the words to make it clear that it is a shame for man to wear long hair like women in 1 Cor 11:14), I also agree:   He Is Risen!!",ITrCool,2025-04-20T08:23:06,-69
"And this is one of the few subs on this garbage website where people are allowed to talk openly about Christianity. Ironic, since the holiday in-and-of itself is Christian. We must pray for those wayward souls who have not yet felt the warm embrace of God.   The Church seems more important than ever in this day and age. How is a young person supposed to find their way when all the lunatics around them screams about how terrible religion is?",TheMorningDove,2025-04-20T13:59:44,-4

I'd bet good money that at least 1 of the 10 replies to you that I can't see is some leftist atheist whining about how the modern Easter holiday co-opted the pagan celebration for Spring.,Original_Lord_Turtle,2025-04-21T05:55:13,2
