"I think one major thing missing from most of the other analyses here is that we have states that have very few workers that are of use in the 21st century.   Rural, more male, less educated areas are not capable of competition in or joining in industries the US has strong competitive advantages in. So lightly skilled or unskilled labor are the main things those people can do, and manufacturing is the best thing for that.",Precursor2552,2025-04-04T05:35:35,353
"Because factory union jobs helped build the middle class in this country post ww2. You didn’t need to go to college to work in a factory and earn a living wage. Many small towns revolved around the full time union jobs with benefits provided by a factory. Those jobs were lost to offshoring jobs, trade agreements, prioritization of shareholders, share price and executives over workers, Americans massive demand for cheaper goods, and automation etc. We still manufacture stuff here, just not nearly as much as we used to. Every president and both political parties recognize the problem to one degree or another. But what Trump is doing is absolute madness and will harm everyone. I mean humans have been trading since prehistoric times!",Cluefuljewel,2025-04-04T05:20:57,40
"Right-wing populism is rooted in false nostalgia.  Things used to be better, even if they weren't.  We can't have it both ways.  If a TV set costs $1500 instead of $500, there will be fewer TVs sold.  Jobs that are supported by those sales will be lost, leaving even less money to buy those overpriced TVs.  It doesn't help that the US president has a mob boss mentality.  He is a bully and wants other nations to kiss his ring so that he can feel good about himself.  If other nations are wise, they will coordinate their counterattacks and render him ineffective.  That being said, nations are wise to maintain some industrial capacity so that they can't be held captive by others.  Ironically, Trump proves that point, as it becomes evident that other nations are unwise to depend upon the US for their military gear or much else.",I405CA,2025-04-04T04:29:29,762
"People are being lied to about what a ""trade deficit"" is.  I go to McDonald's and buy a hamburger. That's a trade deficit. I am giving them more money than they are giving me, and they are giving me more product than I am giving them. That does not mean that I am going to buy a farm, raise cattle, grow wheat and vegetables, and make my own hamburger from scratch. I have better things to do, and the economies of scale do not work in my favor.  Sadly, we have a president who understands ""cash"" but doesn't understand ""value."" He thinks we are ""subsidizing"" Canada by ""giving"" them money, because he can't understand either the hard value of the items we purchase or the soft value of a friendship.",hymie0,2025-04-04T04:56:55,254
"I think part of it is rooted in misunderstanding and misinformation about what manufacturing today would entail and cost and the other part has to do with past nostalgia. Whenever I buy products made in the USA they virtually always cost more than their foreign made counterparts. Not to mention, in the past when manufacturing was a viable and well paid industry we weren’t the technology driven era that we are now in. Career priorities should be on stem fields, medicine and research etc. That is what other developing and competing nations are doing, that is what US should be doing but now our research grants, medical research funding, etc. are under attack through funding cuts. So to add insult to injury on the tarrifs and manufacturing push you also have the double whammy of restricting the progress and growth of the important fields we need to stay competitive in. That is to say nothing of Elon musk’s mention of a robotic workforce in manufacturing that will save companies the costs of human workers.",ScarTemporary6806,2025-04-04T04:44:54,75
"There are currently around 13 million American manufacturing jobs. My brother works in a union manufacturing plant. Historically, we manufactured a lot more and some people point to the 90s and NAFTA to blame on why the jobs left.   During Covid people started freaking out even more that we don’t produce crucial medical equipment, technology, and more. Semiconductors and batteries have been a big focus too. Since 2020 something like $20 billion has been invested in new green manufacturing to try and stimulate these jobs/industries back. A lot of government investment, like the Inflation Reduction Act and state money.   In a lot of places, these are the best jobs by far. Some people like doing manual work, they pay better than retail or food which is what a lot of these communities have for work, and it can be more stable. Manufacturing is one of the few industries left where people can stay a loooong time and, contrary to popular belief, this work requires skill.   On the flip side, tariffs can help stimulate domestic manufacturing if there is a concrete plan on how to actually bring this stuff back and they are applied sparingly. There is no plan and the things Trump thinks we can just make here are going to take years to get up and running. I’m sure he’ll take credit for all the stuff that’s been 5 years in the making.",nyliaj,2025-04-04T05:11:12,34
"People seem to think America was better in the 50s and 60s when they fail to mention that today we have a higher standard of living, higher incomes, better access to goods and services, and the availability of cheap products to consume.   They also seem to think that everyone wants to work in manufacturing rather than white collar jobs. They fail to realize that today we heavily automate manufacturing and production processes so that less people are needed, efficiency improvement, and high productivity. Then they never seem to be able to explain that with historically low unemployment 3-4%, how would we even staff these jobs? Most people who want to be employed are already working.   Then there is the problem of the upfront costs of acquiring land, building a facility, filling that facility with equipment and machinery, having a trained work force, and ironing out all the kinks in your production process to maximize efficiency and profit. Why would a company invest billions into these facilities when it's likely that tariffs will be removed down the road once everyone realizes the poor outcomes that typically arise from such policies?   These people are also talking about going against several decades of incremental changes to what we have today, and trying to just undo all of that. It'll take decades to accomplish, it's unlikely we would accomplish this, and it's hard to argue that we would be better off going down this road rather than finding other solutions.   I hope all of these people are ready for pain, because there is a lot of it to come. Consumers have been pulling back, manufacturer index is in the dumps, builder sentiment is shrinking, and we haven't even hit the price increases, stifled demand, and reduced growth yet.",danvapes_,2025-04-04T05:14:16,42
"Because people need to feed their families. They see that old shut down factory in their town where they could work if only it would re-open. Some people don't know how to hustle. They don't have a higher education. They don't have specific skills. They just need a job, any job. If you open a factory you will have hundreds, or thousands of jobs available.  Trump gives them the false hope of a good paying job at a factory.

"I mean, manufacturing jobs are good, decent jobs that should pay well.  The issue is the world has gotten so used to cheap labor from China that they can't imagine paying people living wages because the cost of goods would increase.

"My husband is a millwright at a steel mill and we can 100% understand why people would want those kinds of jobs back, if the conditions at his work are any indication.  The pay is good (enough for me to be able to stay home with our children), the benefits are great (no monthly premiums and good coverage), the union is strong, there's a good pension plan, a decent amount of paid time off and of all of the workplaces my husband has been in, the overall conditions and pros exceed other places he's worked.   I remember when he first started there- he couldn't believe how ""nice"" and happy everyone seemed to be. We put it down to the fact that it truly is a decent living without a whole lot of emotional stress, even though the work can be physically exhausting at times.   Unfortunately there have been a lot of layoffs in recent years, which has killed morale understandably. But if his first few years at the mill are anything to go by (and even now still to a lesser extent), the nostalgia for these kinds of jobs is warrented.   While as a millwright, my husband is considered a skilled employee, there's still plenty of ""unskilled"" general laborers at the mill who get paid well- much better than retail/hospitality/customer service/fast food, etc, who only need a high school diploma and the ability to pass the pre-employment physical. Even at that pay, when coupled with the incentives (which can be a lot depending on the department) and benefits the job provides, it would be enough to support a family modestly.   I think when a lot people think of manufacturing, they think of jobs and conditions like my husband's situation. Would every manufacturing job be that good? No, probably not- especially they keep the Unions out. But my husband's job is definitely the dream and the ideal that most people who idealize manufacturing have.",STLFleur,2025-04-04T08:12:11,9
"This is NOT intended as a complete answer. At least some people are predicting a complete demographic collapse accompanied by an economic/societal collapse of China due in large part to unintended effects of the One-Child Policy compounded by the common decline in birthrates that follows urbanization(See Germany, S. Korea). If they are even partially correct, there will be some unknown time when exports from China will become more unreliable than during COVID. That necessitates getting alternatives to China set up either in other countries or here in the US. It's not just Trump, either.

"Both sides of the fence want manufacturing to come back because everyone believes it will bring back the high paying blue collar jobs of the 1950/60s. Of course this collectively forgets that golden age was partly caused by a lack of foreign competition, strong trade unions, and lots of government spending.

"Don’t mistake what Trump is doing as some ploy to get manufacturing back here. He doesn’t care. He wants tariffs to replace income tax so the idea of taxing the rich can be taken off the table forever and we can return to the gilded age and the time of the robber barrons.   Trump is not in touch with reality and he never has been. This is about enrichment for him, and getting revenge on all the agencies and people who stopped him from doing all the crazy shit he wanted to do during his first term (like reopening everything in April of 2020 during covid) and damaging everyone who didn’t vote for him in 2020. His dismantling of the government with musk is very much a reaction from the 1% being mad that they were stopped by various agencies from doing whatever the fuck they wanted to do.   Back on topic, the gulf between pay for the CEOs and the average person was much much smaller in the 50a-70s, the era these people want to go back to, BECAUSE WE TAXED THE RICH. The reason you could have manufacturing jobs and other things paying what they did is because we still had an education system that was funded, we were investing in science and invest in American infrastructure, manufacturing, and our own people. The highest tax bracket was 95%. We are doing NONE of those things now and we’ve put the dumbest possible people in charge.   Everything else going on is window dressing to disguise the real problem. America was at its most prosperous when we taxed the rich.  Also, if you’re a business you aren’t going to immediately jump to build factories here because trump is unstable. You could spend a shit ton of money, invest in buildings, workforce, payroll systems, etc. and layout tons of capital and STILL end up holding the bag because Trump has no plan here. He could decide tomorrow to go after your company because he perceives you as “disloyal” to America.   Make no mistakes these tariffs are NOT going to bring growth to America, they’re going to do the opposite. Companies are going to wait us out while Trump crashes the economy.",RoninChaos,2025-04-04T08:02:05,5
"So they don't have to work three jobs to survive. Historically, manufacturing has been a hot bed for union activity. Corporations do not want to pay their employees a fair wage due to the profit motive. This is why the US deindustrialized and sought ""new markets"" -easily exploited labor- to make products that wouldn't cut into wealthy pockets. Politicians know people want a reliable steady stream of income so they press this button often. However, they have no intention of being jobs back because that would hurt corporations. Both parties do this.  The difference is, we do not have the infrastructure anymore to manufacture. Not to the extent that Americans consume. It would take a planned economic model to accomplish this goal because capital will not be invested in long term projects. Or, if they do they will use it as a way to subsidize their personal earnings like the tech industry does. To combat the rise in price the government would have to implement price control. Which they won't because it'll cut into the profits of corporations and the wealthy.",False_Celebration626,2025-04-04T04:55:59,23
"Gen-Xer here. When I was growing up, the economy looked quite different than it does now. We knew things were changing, but you could still get a reasonably well-paying job in a factory, or tobacco farming. I assume coal mining was a more viable field then as well, but I didn't live near any coal mines, so nobody was talking about that the same way they were talking about working for this factory or that one.  Then, NAFTA came along and many of those jobs started moving to Mexico. Anxiety among the ""unskilled"" working class was high. (I put unskilled in quotes because I have worked factory jobs in the past and keeping up with assembly lines absolutely is a skill).  Then, the 2016 election became a microcosm for where we are economically. The media started talking about coal minors who were losing their jobs. Hillary's response was that she wanted to invest in training programs to pay college tuition for people like this and to create small business incubators in communities that had developed around mining and were now facing high unemployment. Trump promised he would bring the mining jobs back, but never gave an explanation of how, other than vague references to deregulation.   Now, think about what it must have been like to be a middle-aged coal minor or factory worker. You probably feel like you've spent a lifetime being looked down upon by college-educated people and Hillary Clinton thinks you're going to spend the next four years sitting in a classroom with kids half your age and learn to write software? Who's going to pay the house payment? Are you really smart enough? You didn't think you were twenty years ago! And then when you get out, you'll be pushing fifty, but you think you will be able to hold your own on a job interview while competing against these same kids?  So, I can see how when Trump says he'll wave a magic wand and turn us into a nation of coal miners, factory workers, and tobacco farmers, that this is comforting to people who feel like they've been left behind.",tkmorgan76,2025-04-04T09:12:55,4

"Most responses have leaned towards why Trump’s tariffs are a bad idea (which I won’t disagree with), but they don’t answer your question. I’ll answer it in two parts:   - If you’re reliant on another country for goods and services, you have less leverage in international relations. Take steel for example: if the United States shut down their plants and imported super cheap steel from China (which they would be HAPPY to do) to make their tanks and aircraft carriers, then how would they fare in a war when trade for critical manufacturing elements is obsolete? Same goes for pharmaceuticals, among other industries. A strong domestic supply chain, given you have the natural resources and talent, is important to protect. Most other countries already have tariffs against the US so they protect their own industries in this regard.   - “Manufacturing” jobs are a low-barrier-to-entry, and often well-paying, career for those of us who choose not to take out obscene loans for college and would rather work a good job with our hands. Achieving wealth in the US economy is heavily weighted towards a path of taking out heavy loans, working for some company with abstract IP none of us understand, and exporting that idea or software to the world. There’s a GIANT gap in opportunity in this economy, and a stronger industrial and manufacturing base helps level that gap.  Am I arguing that Trump’s tariff policy is good? No. Will I argue that incentivizing good-paying, low-barrier-to-entry manufacturing jobs are good for our country? Hell yes.",bfhurricane,2025-04-04T06:04:10,14

"There are cold strategic aims to having a good manufactuirng base, one of the ways the US was able to win WW2 in the pacific was just to make more ships than the Japanese, China is now in the position the US was in around/after the 1940s in terms of world manufacturing. The pandemic is another example, where vital equipment became more expensive because it was made abroad.   Also, manufacturing jobs in the US after the 1800s, on average pay more for people with a high school education than equivalently qualified service jobs. The last major deindustrialisation wave was the 'china shock' where US 'company town' niche manufacturing started to be outcompeted by Chinese firms in the 00s, with the loss of a few million of these type of jobs. But before then, going back to the 80s-90s there was a conscious effort to shift US manufacturing abroad, partly to finish off US unions as a political force.  There were a lot of benefits to the US as 'post industrial', the top 15% of society is much richer than in the late 70s, especially the top 1%, homeowners, university educated workers (until recently), cities and electronics consumers were also 'winners'. But deindustrialisation waves going back to the 70s are associated with negative outcomes for high school educated people; a breakdown in 'social reproduction', rise out of wedlock births, drug addiction, gang violence, homelessness, etc. Most of the major drug crises are correlated with deindustrialisation, cocaine/crack, meth, opioids, etc.   There is some complex phenomenon where a fall in the gender pay gap for socially conservative communities is associated with more out-of-wedlock births, in the US (but not EU with it's better welfare states) these  correlate with chaotic family environments that are in turn associated with poor school performance, personality disorders, etc, especially for boys.",batmans_stuntcock,2025-04-04T08:10:57,4

"I know I'm way out of my depth for such a difficult topic, but here is my take on the subject :    At the moment, the push for bringing manufacturing jobs back to America is discussed in both economic and cultural terms, but the deeper motivations behind it go far beyond simple nostalgia imo.    Some argue that it is tied to a romanticized vision of mid-20th-century America, a time when industrial jobs were abundant and the middle class thrived. However, this idealized past is often presented without acknowledging the societal inequalities and exploitative practices that defined that era.   What seems to be at play here is a broader strategy aimed at shaping public opinion. Nostalgia for manufacturing jobs serves not just to garner support from older generations but also to appeal to those who claim to understand the workings of economics, even when their agendas are politically driven rather than economically sound. History has shown that policies based on protectionism and tariffs, like those of the 1930s, can have disastrous consequences, such as triggering economic downturns... The Great Depression did happen!  On a deeper level, this longing for the ""good old days"" of manufacturing reflects a desire to return to a specific societal structure, one that subtly undermines decades of progress in civil rights and social equity. In the 1960s and 1970s, the U.S. shifted its economic focus to services and financial markets, outsourcing production to poorer nations. This was framed as an evolution of capitalism, but in reality, it allowed America to profit at the expense of others.   Today’s efforts to revive domestic manufacturing, while couched in economic rhetoric, often mask a regressive agenda that seeks to control the narrative and restore a less inclusive society. I mean, banning DEI initiatives for the sake of meritocracy while having an administration based on cronyism is Trumpism 101.  In essence, the call to bring back manufacturing jobs operates on multiple levels—economic, political, and cultural. But it’s crucial to question the intentions behind these appeals and consider the broader implications for progress and equity.",LeatherBandicoot,2025-04-04T06:46:47,3
"I think that America shouldn't be reliant on other countries for products, as well as the US should be solely a service country like it's known for.  Look what happened when the pandemic happened a lot of products did not come in because of the pandemic. Production was cut down to mitigate the spread of covid, and that led to less products coming in from other countries. There were other factors at play that affected the rate products hit shelves like transferring products from location A to location B The US in this case. Lots of boats were fully packed, but remained docked for months due to covid. So even less needed products coming into the US.   Yes there is truth about how America was before where the US did produce more before China expanded and companies hired offshore workers and opened factories in other countries. Here is why that is bad, it led to less jobs in the US because other countries took them up. Now more than ever there are less jobs available in the US with A.I. and self check out services taking them it's getting very thin in the US employment system. Entry level expects some years of experience and education when entry uses to be bare minimum of a high school diploma/GED and usually training on the job.   It's also not good to be reliant on another country for every good and just be a service country. One morning they may be your ally, the next your their adversary. It's always important to be independent from them and not codependent on an adversary. That puts a country at a disadvantage.   Finally in the case of China, Lots of businessmen hire workers off us soil because it costs less. Not only is it bad for the US workforce, it's bad for the environment look at the smog in China, it's bad for their people because it encourages.mistreatment of their workers. As long as someone is willing to buy workers at that low price they will continue to work in poor conditions many die. The reason it's so cheap is because it cuts what would be the equivalent of a US workers rights and benefits out for the Chinese worker. That's why they work in such poor conditions and get paid so poorly. They don't have the same rights, benefits, and minimum wages. It's like businessmen want to promote slave workers.  I'd like to point this out. Conservative Republicans like to beat the drum about Communism, yet lots of them are businessmen who do hire overseas in China because it costs less. If Communism is such a big bad thing and a no no in politics, then why do they keep helping their agenda? Every time they do business with them, and choose a Chinese worker over an American worker that only makes the US businesses and capitalist economy more dependent on China's Communism. They are literally the reason why China is such a threat to the US. So don't just talk the talk, walk the walk. Invest in American workers, not Communist China workers. Otherwise all your political banter and fear mongering about Communism is just bullshit. You're promoting it, not mitigating it. You're(conservative Republicans , businessmen) the cause to them becoming so much larger, and the effect is the US becomes dependent on Communism.  I don't agree with how Donald Trump is approaching the economy with these tariffs , he tried that his first term and that ended up poorly. That hurt the consumers and businesses. Just as China said no one wins in a tariff war. Yet again Communism is one upping Conservative Republicans/ businessmen on economic issues. *Trump is not a successful businessman, he's a successful conman.* Let's do some simple math, what kind of outcome would you expect from someone like Trump and Elon Musk?  The way the US economy is looking now looks a hell of a lot like the outcomes of what happened to Trump University and what happened to Twitter when Elon Musk took over.   Major cuts, less workers, people left unpaid, and debts unfulfilled only to get worse. Both Twitter and Trump University collapsed. Where is the US economy now? It's collapsing.  Trump and Musk aren't successful people nor do they have your best interests at heart.  Both of them inherited their money, they lack the grind to become wealthy, they were born into it. That means they lack the tools, lessons, education, experience, and grind to be successful and wealthy. Someone else did that for them [(Trump's)parents and (Elon's)grandparents, not them.]  just because someone has money does not mean they know what they're doing, or successful.  Learn this or you'll continue to be conned. That's why Trump ""loves the poorly educated"", it's because he can take advantage of you, the Republicans, businessmen, authority figures including religious figures will do this too. Why else to do they put fear mongering thoughts in your head? It's to control you.  Add in one last thing that Trump and Musk have in common- they're both in debt to Russia. Russia has been recruiter western billionaires to due their bidding against America since the end of the cold war. That is part of their agenda. Russia is having Trump and Musk do Russia's bidding to collapse America more and more. So, Trump and Musk level the playing field  for Russia. Why? It goes back to post World War 2, when The US and Russia were right to be the sole superpower. That is what Russia is after to overthrow America and it's democracy(Russia hates democracy and favors the extremes, so they live it when America goes to one extreme otlr the other because the created both of the extreme ideologies in both ends and know how to knock it down from experience.) (if you didn't know Russia created the communist ideology, China made the first party after learning about it from them.)  *Always Question Authority*  Don't care if it's  a businessman, a politician, a world leader, a well known scientist or doctor, someone who claims to know something, even the Pope.  *Always Question Authority*",amiibohunter2015,2025-04-04T08:36:46,3

"Because a large portion of the population did not go further than high school and when factory jobs started leaving, instead of going back to school and learning some tech skills, they decided to buy trucks and take out a second mortgage on the house, and/or buy a boat and blame minorities for taking 'their' jobs instead of being accountable for giving up when these jobs left or got automated. Black Midwesterners did not have this issue we went back to school; this problem is very endemic to the white working class. They left themselves behind.

So I gotta ask: what, precisely, is your plan to address that?  Furthermore, Covid showed the fragility of the global supply chains.  Those global supply chains are the root of the existential climate change problem.  It might be “cheap” to ship raw material from Africa for manufacturing to China then to ship to the U.S. for consumption, but it’s absolutely horrific in terms of environmental damage and emissions.  If you want to be serious about fighting climate change, you have to address that. Local manufacturing can be done with updated and cleaner tech, with less emissions / shipping.  Electric cars and paper straws are trivial compared to that.  I think progressives tend to have some big cognitive dissonance about income inequality and sustainability.",Kman17,2025-04-04T10:11:17,4

In a global economy, fighting against countries with much lower cost-of-living to manufacture is a losing game, so unless we're going to somehow shutdown global trade altogether, you either play by global system rules, or you get left behind.

"You realize we still have these jobs, many paying sub $10/hr wages. Walmart and McDonald's are paying more than some  manufacturing jobs in my area.  Lots of the higher paying jobs are the ones that moved their production to other countries for cheaper labor, they go from paying Americans $35-40/hr to paying $2/hr.  Countries with terrible economies and the people are happy to work for nothing because it's more than the couple dollars they made a day before the factory opened. Meanwhile the company is happy to increase profits massively as payroll is one of the top expenses in nearly any business.  Lots of the GOOD paying factory jobs $40+ hr are the ones that sent production to other countries to take advantage of cheap labor and lax labor laws. Now if they are losing more in tariffs than they are saving on payroll they bring the jobs back here.  Say they were saving $5k in labor per car, now they are paying a $10k tariff, they'll be better off bringing the jobs back to America.

Everyone thinks ""fast food worker"" or ""secretary"" but a lot of them are professionals and IT workers making 6 figures.  It also is biased because a lot of the remaining manufacturing jobs are autoworker and either unionized or influenced by unions and with good pay and benefits.  These kinds of jobs can also be done with lower education and set up even in more rural areas, and so appeal to certain types of voters.  Finally the ways to make money from production are making the product, transporting it, and wholesale/retailing it.  In the US with much of the manufacturing gone you are getting the wholesale/retail and part of the transit, but not the rest.

"Area you seriously asking this question because you don't know the answer or are you trying to foster discussion?  Nevermind,  I'll answer it regardless,  why wouldn't you want manufacturing to come back? It creates unskilled and skilled jobs, it makes us more self reliant,  and the more money we have in circulation that isn't derived from them just printing more makes poor people richer.  When we used to make everything here,  only one parent had to work,  anyone could own a house and a college education was super affordable.   This it's not a Liberal vs. Conservative issue.  One of the biggest problems with our economy is that we don't make things here anymore.   To comment on your statement that it's hard work,  well that's another problem with our society.  Too many people are under the impression that they deserve to have a job that is in a climate controlled environment,  they don't have to lift heavy things occasionally,  and that they should be paid 100k/yr to answer a phone and take an order.  No job is unimportant,  but until people realize that some jobs are hard  even if they're highly skilled,  then we are in bad shape.

"I'll bite.  The world population is not really growing like it used to. It used to be universal, but now population growth is centered in a few places.  In fact, many place are now shrinking.

Japan is leading the way here. There are a ton of folks in retirement age.  China has been rapidly shifting this direction since their 1 child policy.  Country with these sorts of demographics will likely undergo a significant economic collapse.  Too many old people who barely consume, not enough young people who work and  save.

In fact the US has one of the healthiest age demographic distribution of any developed country because of this.  The united states ALSO has an amazing set of resources.  Even things like rare earth metals are available here in the US.  The reason China appears to have short term choke hold on things like this is purely because they're willing to refine these metals without environmental regard. so they can do it cheaper.

Suppose things go south with one of the countries we import from, the process of imports itself get interrupted, or in some way the supply chain goes wonky (we saw this in the COVID lockdown, for instance).

"Analyses estimate that NAFTA cost the US 500 to 875 million jobs (even more with China etc).   With NAFTA Americans saved 1.65 TRILLION. This equates to a rate of 75K/year per job--above average of those workers could have made.  If you want to have a cold, calculating look at it, NAFTA was on the whole good for the US by these numbers. Take the fact that almost all of these workers got alternative jobs and it really argues that NAFTA was a good thing.    The problem is (and this is where manufacturing comes to play), the workers got WORSE jobs.  If you want to be a bit less heartless you might say that the job means more to the workers (and for political stability) than the savings Americans received (which still exceed the loses in numerical terms).  The reason people want manufacturing jobs is they pay better than what they have and they were a way to the middle class without a degree.    Your intuition is correct (except for the standing, people will stand for better pay).  It is economically inefficient to have Americans do things when other countries can do them cheaper (this is part of the tariff 'deadweight loss')--ideally Americans should be doing the things no other country can do.  And with automation getting better everyday this is probably a fools errand anyways.   The best outcome would to take these displaced workers and get them better, more future-proof jobs than manufacturing jobs.  NAFTA had a provision to help these displaced workers called Transitional Adjustment Assistance. However it was capped at 200M/year for budget reasons when the original plan was in the billions.  This would have helped blunt the psychological cost of reduced trade barriers.  The best thing we can do is work with every displaced worker to help them find EVEN BETTER Jobs: if they can become AI engineers (yes some can) then Systems Admins, or Fiber Optic technicians, etc. Some of these jobs don't require a degree, they are more future-proof and pay better than working in manufacturing.

Manufacturing was terrible for the environment as well. We haven't solved  a way to make life sustainable, largely because we over consume. Going out to eat generates unlike unholy amounts of trash that all has to be manufactured as foam plates, plastic straws and paper bags. Those processes are also wasteful.  What we NEED to do is make housing affordable again. And we have the wrong president in power for that to happen because he's the poster boy for real estate ""investment"". $3,000 a month was a king's ransom 50 years ago. But a house used to cost $11,000 50 years ago. Now you have to qualify for a $350,000 loan to even be putting a bid on a house. And that's because section 1031 of the IRS code let's LLC's avoid taxes on capitol gains indefinitely if they ""reinvest in like kind"". So millionaires are buying houses not to live in, but as tax shelters. Then they can borrow against the value of those homes to buy more homes, all the while raising the cost of housing and charging more in rent than the mortgage costs to begin with. We need to tax the shit out of residential ""investment"" homes and return them to the market. Then housing will be affordable again and we won't NEED $9,000 a month to live.

Once you factor in that people live as families with an average of 2.5 people per home, you can see that we have more than twice the number of homes we need! We don't have a housing crisis. We have a hoarding crisis. We have a tax evasion crisis. We have a tax code crisis that incentivizes millionaires all over the world purchasing our housing as tax shelters through LLC's!!!! It doesn't matter how many homes we build through ""affordable housing"" initiatives because once they are built LLC's snatch them up as tax shelters to grow private wealth and rent them out at rates higher than the cost of the mortgage.

Instead we are passing laws increasing the tax exemption on housing because we mistakenly think that's going to help the average citizen. It won't.

Other countries will deny any meaningful changes have occurred and will remain opposed to these actions.

"It's because Trump is an idiot. Reagan gave a speech in the 1980s about how we were transitioning from a manufacturing economy to a service economy. In services we actually have a trade surplus because that's what our economy is based on. By exporting a lot of manufacturing like textiles we exported a lot of our pollution as well. I mean Trump wants to bring back coal so that tells you how reactionary his mindset is. He wants to go backwards. He doesn't really understand anything about the world economy or the fact that our birth rate recent all time low in 2017 or that the the rate of automation and Robotics has replaced a lot of people in the manufacturing business. We still have plenty of manufacturing it's just that it doesn't employ as many people as it once did. However, as time goes on and it becomes more like huxley's Brave New World, what we will need is consumers because we're so far behind India and China in that regard. That's another thing his trade deficit idiotic formula doesn't take into account is the amount of people that we have. We have 347 million people and Canada has 30 million so of course we're going to have a trade deficit with Canada or Mexico which has about 130 million people because they have less consumers so they can't import as much as they export to us. They don't have enough consumers. He thinks the iPhone is going to be made in America and apple is already saying that's not going to happen. But I go back to my basic point- Trump is a moron.

"I can't tell you why ""people"" in general want them back. What i can do is tell you why, from a simple logical perspective, i want them back and why a government in general wants them back. Let's start with premise 1. Globalization is good. We have been told this for years. This is a lie. We'll ok, this is true, for some people. People that basically everyone else hates. Globalization is good for rich people. It has some benefits for normal people but it also has massive downsides. Globalization means that governments can't regulate how things are made, the safety standards in a Chinese factory are massively different than an American one for example. The public can't ensure fair compensation for work either. Also can't ensure children don't work and die in factories like they did here decades ago. All those wonderful worker rights that we fought our asses off for in the 30s and 40s? Those go bye bye in globalized economy. As a government you also can no longer ensure that you keep a leg up on your enemies (no, China isn't your friend. Neither is Russia. You might help each other sometimes but you don't want them knowing the next fighter jet your building). It becomes impossible if 80% of your countries manufactoring is done elsewhere to keep a secret. Let's put all that aside though (people will argue with it all). Instead let's focus on something else. 2. Manufactoring doesn't matter. This is also a lie. Manufactoring literally builds the world. People will say america no longer needs to manufactor. We are a consumer and professional nation now. Thats a massive lie. America still has a massive amount of blue collar working men that twiddle their thumbs, not because they are lazy but because companies moved their jobs to overseas. You need manufactoring jobs. Those jobs are literally the bread and butter of the middle class. The middle class is what buys things. The wealth in our country has been draining from the middle class to the top 1% for decades. The middle class is nearly dead now. Next comes the relatively high class. Lawyers, doctors, professors etc. The megarich will drain them once the middle class dies completely. We see it already. Jobs that once kept your family in a high class are slowly becoming middle class. People with little knowledge of how economics (and many who have the knowledge and simply spout what they are paid to. You know who you are, please shut it) will talk on and on about how wealth will flow downward. This has literally never worked in the history of economics. Wealth has ALWAYS flowed up. Never down. The rich rarely, very rarely ever lose money. Having manufactoring jobs in your own country when your country has the most natural resources in the world doesn't just make sense. It makes the only sense. Why would a country cut down wood only to sell it overseas. Then purchase product made from that wood at 5 times the price? Yet we do it. All the time. America has not been getting richer. As manufactoring jobs have been moved overseas by greedy and short sighted companies the country itself has noticeably gotten poorer except for the small% who own or work high in those companies. The average American today lives with far less income relatively (adjusted for inflation and other factors) than 40 years ago.  Their houses cost 11x what they did and yet they make about 4 times what they did. The math doesn't add up. At no point can anyone look at our economy and say it got better as we lost manufactoring jobs. The companies might make more profit but a government should not be concerned with a companies profit. They should be concerned with the livelihood of their citizens.",Nyspora,2025-04-13T22:59:45,1
"The reason the whole manufacturing job thing is embedded in the American zeitgeist is because POLITICIANS talk about it all the time. It's fanciful yearning for times gone by when the only good work for the middle class was a solid, difficult factory job.  You'd get a pension & gold watch after years of employment (maybe even black lung). These days EVERYBODY can get a college degree. You don't have to work in the factory anymore. You can leave the run down mill town & go to the city & work in an office.

"Factory jobs coming back to the US will be largely operated by robots. So the dream of bringing manufacturing back en-masse to provide jobs ""for the people"", is a sham.  Besides that, we do not have the resources required to achieve the level of production the US needs in 2025 and beyond.   Another point, and I'm seeing this happen already, factories from China are shipping equipment to the US, along with employees to set up and run that equipment. The equipment is 100% manufactured in China and the employees are Chinese citizens.  The material being used for the production is also imported from China.  Then processed in North Carolina and stamped ""made in USA"".  That material is shipped to the other side of the country, where it goes into production using these Chinese machines, operated by Chinese citizens and employees.  So, who primarily in the US does this benefit?  It benefits the owner of the building who is leasing the space out and perhaps, his family.  No other US citizens will benefit from this arrangement.   This is also fact in the luxury industry.  Many factories throughout the EU are owned and operated by Chinese nationals who bought or set up factories in the EU. Then stamp their products ""made in Italy"" or France, Spain, wherever.  But the products, again, are made by Chinese machines and Chinese nationals.   I have nothing against China.  Their production capabilities are beyond any other country in the world. The US, helped build those capabilities by outsourcing.  After 50+ years, there is no turning back.   You want to bring back Black Lung? How about hearing loss, skin diseases, chemical exposure, occupational asthma, silicosis, mental disorders, burns, pulmonary disease, vision loss, hypersensitivity....and the list goes on and on.

Saving money, losing weight. The more you wait, the harder it gets.   People seem to have a real short memory of what things were like when the global supply chains were disrupted. Weren’t costs sky high then? And that’s a virus we overreacted to. Now what happens when you are at war with the country making your goods?  People who think that’s not possible really need to brush up on WW1 and WW2. Yes the assassination of Franz Ferdinand got WW1 going but it was really economics that was the real catalyst. Trade embargoes and a fight for land/resources. It’s insanely naive with 2 massive world wars only 100 years behind us to just assume oh China won’t go to war with us.   You people on Reddit sound like liberal elite a holes.

"However, manufacturing is very different today than in the past. The biggest manufacturing job killer in the U.S. has been automation, not offshoring.   In one GM plant my cousin worked in, they reduced the number of workers by 80 percent with automation. A friend inherited a business manufacturing cabinets for boats, RVs, etc. Her dad ran that business with 150 workers in the 1980s - now she does twice as much volume but with 35 workers because it's so automated, and she is updating to 3D printing which will allow her to do more custom work without adding employees - other than highly skilled 3D printing managers.

"I'm going to hijack your comment because it's near the top.   Nearly every post is addressing emotional reasons for bringing manufacturing back to the US, such as nostalgia.  A significant reason is economics. I don't have a degree in economics, but I had to take a few courses in college. In the macroeconomics classes they taught that 2 things create value: 1. Resources (minerals and food) 2. Manufacturing  Everything else serves to move the value around. The moving of the value around is incredibly important, but without resources and manufacturing you'll eventually move all the value to the countries where the resources and manufacturing are sourced.  The US grows and exports a ton of food, but does relatively little with our minerals and manufacturing.   China used to be known for creating crap products that would break, but were affordable. The US was known for quality and expensive products. China stepped up their quality and is still more affordable than US made. The US can't compete with Chinese products and prices anymore. The US has trouble competing with any country, it's very expensive to manufacture in the US. So tariffs are a tool used to make it too expensive to import items manufactured outside the US.  It will make everything more expensive in the US and pushes the US towards isolation while the rest of the world moves forward.   Given the option between making it more affordable to manufacture in the US vs making imports more expensive, Trump chose to make imports more expensive. This will hurt the middle and low income earners. Anyone who can afford to invest in local manufacturing will do well.",The3stParty,2025-04-04T11:28:49,26

Specifically re: masks, this [article](https://www.npr.org/2021/06/25/1009858893/u-s-companies-shifted-to-make-n95-respirators-during-covid-now-theyre-struggling#:~:text=Before%20the%20pandemic%20began%2C%20about,manufactured%20N95s%20in%20factories%20abroad) describes the crux of the issue.   >Before the pandemic began, about 10 American companies were actively making N95 respirators, according to Anne Miller, executive director of the nonprofit ProjectN95, a national clearinghouse for PPE founded in 2020. Larger companies such as Honeywell and 3M also manufactured N95s in factories abroad. All told, fewer than 10% of the N95 respirators used in the U.S. were manufactured domestically, according to industry experts.  >The dependency on China and other foreign countries was nothing new, recalled Mike Bowen, executive vice president of Prestige Ameritech, one of the oldest domestic manufacturers of masks in the United States.  >In 2009, during the H1N1 pandemic, Prestige Ameritech stepped up production to meet the growing domestic need.  >“Last time we were stupid,” Bowen said. “We believed everyone when they said they would stay with us. ... We’re buying a factory, we’re building more machines, we’re hiring people, but you got to stay with us. And everybody said they would, but they didn’t.”  >As soon as the health scare was over, the market dried up. The aftermath was harsh — laid-off workers, financial losses — but he survived.  >“It’s like people want to have their cake and eat it too. They want to have the cheapest prices — they want China prices — but then they want American manufacturers to bail them out when they can’t get their Chinese products. That doesn’t work,” Bowen said. For comparison, one N95 respirator costs about 25 cents to manufacture in China. Producing the same product in the U.S. can cost more than double.  >When the COVID-19 pandemic began, Bowen’s company was slammed with new orders. His facility uses primarily domestically sourced raw materials, so he stepped up again. He ramped up production to meet the growing demand, adding more machines and increasing his labor force more than threefold.  >Now, much cheaper masks from abroad have reentered the market yet again, as China has lifted export embargoes, competing directly against masks made in America. Bowen has six machines sitting idle in his factory.  This is not an efficient or tenable solution. The benefit of integrated economies is that, outside of a global pandemic, there are mutually beneficial relationships worth maintaining that allow for goods to be produced in a more efficient, sustainable manner. Maintaining all of that manufacturing capacity without demand doesn’t make sense. I suppose the government can bail out the companies that shifted gears to bail us out by increased supply, but that also isn’t sustainable. Few people benefit when we need to pay 2x for a product to ensure it’s made here.   So I don’t think that most people forgot how vulnerable we were during that moment, but few people are willing to consume 50% less to account for the higher costs of domestic goods.",brickbacon,2025-04-04T05:59:20,2

"Area you seriously asking this question because you don't know the answer or are you trying to foster discussion?  Nevermind, I'll answer it regardless, why wouldn't you want manufacturing to come back? It creates unskilled and skilled jobs, it makes us more self reliant, and the more money we have in circulation that isn't derived from them just printing more makes poor people richer.   \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  I agree with you. Sometimes I wonder if the people on Reddit are residents of the USA or are from other countries and are terrified that the USA will succeed in bringing manufacturing jobs back to the USA.   In my extreme youth I worked in an auto assembly plant that no longer exists. Standing on my feet the entire shift was no worse for my body than sitting at a desk all day. In fact, it was probably healthier. The pay was very good for a teenager. The only downside was that I was required by the UAW to work weekends when I was needed. However, I was paid time and a half. At least in the auto industry, it was not true that cars made in the USA were more expensive than those made in other countries.  If there's a flaw in manufacturing, it's decision making at the top, not high salaries for the rank and file. The USA automakers failed to build well engineered small fuel efficient cars. The Pinto and Vega sold well until the flaws were revealed.  Eastman Kodak failed to realize they were in the imaging, not the film business.  Sears Roebuck was once a combination of Amazon, Cabelas, Lowes and JC Penney. It was decisions at the top that hurt them, not the rank and file workers.

">Once again, no one wants to explain why tariffs are bad only if imposed by the USA.  Who is making that argument? Saying tariffs are all good or all bad is like saying radiation is all good or bad. It really depends on the context. Look at the American/Canadian dairy trade, for example. All agriculture in America is heavily subsidized by the federal government. That's a good thing because we need to be able to feed ourselves, any country that must import food to feed its population is in a vulnerable position. If we just let American agriculture play out on the free market we wouldn't grow/raise anything herw because without the subsidies the American stuff cost too much. Canada has high tariffs on American dairy products, and the reason why is because we subsidize our dairy production more than they do theirs which makes our product cheaper. They still have their own dairy farmers to think about, thus the tariffs. If the cost of American dairy wasn't so low due to the tax dollars we prop the industry up with those tariffs would go away.  A different angle is electric vehicles. BYD in China makes a decent, cheap ev. We have high tariffs on Chinese evs because the American consumer would buy the cheap ones over American made. If free trade cratered American ev production not only would we lose the jobs, we would lose the ability to make evs here. It's an emerging tech that will only become more important in the future so keeping the ability to produce it here and be on the bleeding edge of tech advancements in that field is important. If you are a consumer who wants a cheap ev you are hosed though.   It's all about tradeoffs. Some shit, particularly tech, aerospace, agriculture, military, ect., you want to protect for national security reasons, even if it sucks for the consumer. Other shit does not and will never make sense to make here because the cost of making it here would be egregious to the consumer. Also there are things we straight up can't make here. No amout of tariffs on coffee imports are going to make coffee plantations spring up here because we don't have the climate to grow it. It's  not an all or nothing issue and effective tariffs are generally targeted at a specific industry for specific reasons, which is why using tariffs like a sledgehammer instead of a scalpel is butt fucking stupid.",Snatchamo,2025-04-04T06:30:50,5

"There are many reasons, not all of them good. It's really carrot vs the stick, the carrot is a choice with reward. The stick is a punishment. Trump didn't care to give a choice for the masses.  By making imports more expensive you limit choices, expensive local made or expensive foreign made.   It's easier, all it requires is passing a blanket executive order and letting the dominoes fall. Making it more affordable to manufacture in the US requires updating infrastructure (which hasn't been what people have been voting for until recently), loosening regulations, giving business incentives, and a ton of other moving parts.  It's faster, making things affordable takes time, especially infrastructure. Tariffs are fast. Granted the benefits of infrastructure updates will last longer and tariffs can be removed by the next administration. If Trump went the slow route the eventual benefits likely wouldn't be seen during this term.  Now for the really shady stuff.  If it results in destroying the US economy and puts people out of jobs they'll have to accept lower paying jobs in manufacturing, which would have had higher wages if the economy didn't collapse.   If the US economy collapses people who hoarded money can now buy land and factories for cheap.  If the US economy collapses local governments will do anything in their power to bring jobs to their area, tax breaks, free land, rezoning, clear cutting once protected lands.

Its as if everyone in this thread took Macro and Micro Economics and has no real grasp of Trade on International Monetary Policy? You have a very basic understand of economics which is why you would even consider this working.  What you are describing above is for all intents and purposes deflation. Do you have any idea how bad that is? It is a spiral down to a depression. What you are describing as happening is the worst possible outcome for our country.  1. Reduces consumer spending 2. Lowers business investment (no factory building) 3. Increased Debt Burden ( the amount you owe on your mortgage increase) 4. Can lead to a Spiral effect of the three above 5. Difficult adjusting wages down because obviously people dont want less 6. Loss of confidence by consumers and businesses 7. Increased Unemployment  The real kicker is Monetary Policy that is used to help in these situations could be fucked. Considering interest rates are only at 7% or so you can not lower the rates below zero. When we had a really bad issues before in the early 70's and late 70's interest rates were in the teens.  There is no situation possible where we would bring back manufacturing jobs to America. Its a fucking pipe dream. We will have automated factories when those jobs come back to America and the only jobs will be to clean them and maintain the robots.  The industrial manufacturing middle class is a freaking Zombie and there is no way to bring it back and it will only get worse over the next 20 years with AI and Automation.

Imagine going to your board and asking for 100m to build a factory and 4 months after ground breaking Trump goes on TV and says he is lifting them or you just finish building the factory and the next President takes office and lifts them... Try explaining that to your board... Good luck.  Someone has to tell these people the freaking truth. The old manufacturing middle class is dead and never coming back. Go to school learn to be an engineer etc...  And let me state one truth i have and others have experienced first hand   It is next to impossible to find good workers in the US.
