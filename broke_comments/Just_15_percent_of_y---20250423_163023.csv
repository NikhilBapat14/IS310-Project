"Considering environmentalism has been destroyed. And happened to be behind on dealing with it, by about 50 years...   Things are going to get rough.  I suggest the young Americans learn how to cook, plant gardens and crops, basic survival would be useful.

"How is it that high?  15% of young people think that any of this is a good idea? There is still way too much misinformation out there... I can't think of a single reason that anybody young would think that any of this benefits them. That's because it doesn't... If anything they're going to be the ""lost generation.""  So, they have legitimately no future under Trump and their only hope is him being removed from office? And 15% of young people approve of that? All of that stuff that their parents had, they want none of that? Really?",Actual__Wizard,2025-04-23T16:35:18,10

"*Just a quarter of young Americans said the country is better off under President Trump, while 41 percent said they think it was better under former President Biden.*  *At the same time, trust in congressional Democrats has dropped to 23 percent from the 42 percent logged around this time in Trump‚Äôs first term.
