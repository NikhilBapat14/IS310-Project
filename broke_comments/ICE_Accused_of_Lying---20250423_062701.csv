"> “We are deeply concerned that HSI officers attempted to question several children, between first and sixth grade, during the school day apparently without contacting or coordinating in advance with the schools, parents or guardians, or state or local child welfare agencies,”  It's just shocking, honestly, the sheer gall to suggest this was routine, it's not. To believe that these agencies can just swoop in and interrogate kids without parental consent is deeply disturbing, and it's a worrying sign of what's to come, I think. It's one thing to be concerned about something, but it's another to see this happen... the assumption that they were just checking on welfare is a smokescreen. It's chilling.",Tremenda-Carucha,2025-04-23T06:36:28,437

"According to the article:    >The Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers showed up at two LA Unified School District elementary schools in early April and misled faculty into thinking they had permission from parents to speak with students.
