">The Democratic Party in Florida is dead  When you're one of the highest-elected officeholders of the political party you're claiming is dead, and so you also probably were in a position to either obstruct or hasten that demise, quitting the party like a sore loser taking his ball and going home, is not the great look you probably think it is.",pierre_x10,2025-04-24T16:33:45,1
"If a leader says their party is dead, I'd tend to believe it because  it often rots from the top down. But I'm not seeing that where i live.",noage,2025-04-24T16:27:42,1

"This is actually probably a decent play in some areas. I don't know the actual reasoning behind his switch, but Democrat policies \*are\* popular if they aren't tied to a (D) candidate...this might have to be the move in some red states and areas. Not saying this is HIS reasoning, but there is some merit in the overall idea.",Prayer_Warrior21,2025-04-24T17:12:40,1
