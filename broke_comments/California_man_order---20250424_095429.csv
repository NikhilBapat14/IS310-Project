"By Billal Rahman — Immigration Reporter |  A man born in California recently received an email from the Department of Homeland Security instructing him to self-deport from the United States immediately.  ""CBP used the known email addresses of the alien to send notifications. If a non-personal email—such as an American citizen contact—was provided by the alien, notices may have been sent to unintended recipients,"" a senior DHS official told Newsweek.

"It’s cheap scare tactics, they’re just email blasting out to whatever known email addresses they have hoping for people to scare people into leaving on their own. With that being said, isn’t it pretty obvious to everyone reading this that a client listed the non-profit’s email address, and the notice was not clearly not directed at this man but at one of his clients? Feels totally sensationalist to say a US citizen is being ordered to leave the country when it’s really his client being ordered to leave.  Edit: I do think this guy is taking the right actions by bringing media attention to it, him being hispanic means he has grounded fears of some dumbass ICE agents nabbing him instead of his client.",Horton_Takes_A_Poo,2025-04-24T10:13:01,10

"I would support some 'mostly peaceful' protests. Similar to what we had in Minneapolis, along with other locations, in 2020.  Something has to happen. The 'guardrails of democracy' are all failing due to Trump's disregard for law and the Constitution. The only resistance he gets is stern words from liberal politicians.  Also, since it's literally impossible for Trump to break the law, it's completely our hands.",FartyJizzums,2025-04-24T10:34:39,23

"Weirdly I have a very hard time believing any of those people would of voted for Trump. Part of my suspicion is because he did run in 2000 & it was a joke. Nobody probably even knew he ran. There’s this weird dichotomy where you would think your comment holds true, but in reality those people would have never voted in a candidate whose obvious goal is dictatorship. This I think shows just how easily technology/internet has brainwashed people into believing even basic no go’s for almost ever American back then.

"“Decades” is underselling it quite a bit. It’s been an issue since before America was even founded. Multiple Founding Fathers wrote in several letters how they believed that democracy was a bad idea and that the rich and well educated were inherently meant to rule. Some of them were just trying to get richer out from under the King’s thumb, they couldn’t have cared any less about people’s supposed Inalienable Rights  Fascism/ authoritarianism has been a festering wound in America’s heart since it began beating, we’ve just been lucky enough that there were just enough people in the right places fighting for what was right and not just what made them rich.",pasher5620,2025-04-24T21:49:36,1

One barrier is work- most of us (I’m in the same age range) are working 2+ jobs and just can’t afford to not work. Even weekend protests I can’t attend because if I miss even 1 paycheck it’s over for me and thousands (millions?) of others like me.   Also- we won’t start seeing anything real until the majority of people are missing meals. We’re only 3 missed meals away from a revolution and the majority of Americans are still having 5.,Dry_Purple_,2025-04-24T11:29:35,12

"What about those in university? I worked part time and attended classes. Always had roommates and kept my expenses low because I was broke. My generation protested like crazy during the first gulf war. We rarely even see Gaza War protests anymore. We are watching a coup in real time, and only the old heads seem to care. I am not financially well off and the struggle is what gets me out on the streets. I also just witnessed my VETERAN father struggle to get help while he was in hospice. My Dad’s vet benefits were arriving late and he had to worry about it while he was dying! My parents lost their retirement because of my Mom’s long term illness. What is it going to take to get people on the streets? My Dad’s death was uncomfortable because he had shitty, underfunded care. Do younger people not have grandparents who are suffering? Is the hate for boomers fueling this apathy? Sorry to rant. This lack of unity is frightening and depressing.

Let me give a more personal example of what I’m going through- (which, don’t take this as me arguing *against* you in anyway! I just wanna give a perspective)  If I stop working, my parents loose their house and it’ll fuck up their credit (Loans). It’s a long story, one I’d rather not hash out on Reddit- for privacy. But I can’t let that happen. I feel like I’m held hostage by these companies and there’s no way out. Is a revolution going to take care of that? Maybe. But we’re not at that point yet, so I can’t do anything. It’s not that we’re blind, it’s that we’re in binds and can’t risk getting out of them lest we hurt our families.
