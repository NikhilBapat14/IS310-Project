I mean they kind of have to be for this whole ‚Äúit‚Äôs always been about it China‚Äù pivot to work.   Any tariff deal that doesn‚Äôt build a coalition of south Asian countries against China will fail.,EliteJassassin101,2025-04-21T09:54:17,151
1. India becomes US trade partner  2. China falls  3. India annexes China  4. New Indochina becomes world power  5. Bollywood in Space,squunkyumas,2025-04-21T10:20:58,136
"I've always thought this makes a lot of sense.  China is an adversarial power to the US, full stop. We trade with them for the economic boon, and there's leverage to be had there, but there's always the overlooking of the obvious, geopolitical tension in the Pacific.  India however has always existed in its own sphere. It's adversarial with China, it has normalized trade but slim cooperation with Russia. Their economy is growing. Pulling them in our camp does a lot to tip the balance away from China on the economic front. More opportunities to leverage Russia into compliance too.",Dungeon_Pastor,2025-04-21T12:54:02,49
I misinterpreted the title at first thinking china was going to try to pivot to India in an effort to bridge the gap left by diminishing American consumerism and I was having a good chuckle ü§≠,Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-04-21T10:11:44,10
We don't need China. China needs us. We can crush China without harming ourselves.,theboss2461,2025-04-21T09:40:57,-25
"Yeah, we need to put our foot down on it too. India enabled China to bypass our chip restrictions by RESELLING the chips (ie, Nvidia graphics cards, Intel/AMD chips, etc.) to China.  India isn't loyal, and they are acquaintances AT-BEST. They've undermined us in the (recent) past, and surely they will do it again.",LordRattyWatty,2025-04-21T10:32:05,31

"This is true @ ‚Äútheboss2461‚Äù! India can make up the difference when we decouple from China and they are willing to do it. Why? Because it is a win/win for the USA üá∫üá∏ and India üáÆüá≥! China has a lot to lose, don‚Äôt kid yourself!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-21T10:06:38,12
