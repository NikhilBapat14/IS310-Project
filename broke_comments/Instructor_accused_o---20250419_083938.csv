The very people who whinge about losing their democracy HATE free speech. They really are the worst authoritarians ever.,intrigue-bliss4331,2025-04-19T09:34:15,157
"Charged with fourth-degree misdemeanor assault, not much worse than jaywalking.  That's the travesty.",vampirepomeranian,2025-04-19T10:34:31,54

Good. He should have (if he hasn’t already) charges brought against him and his career ruined. He shouldn’t be allowed anywhere near a classroom again since he can’t show grown up self control.,ITrCool,2025-04-19T08:42:17,84

"Unsurprisingly, the attacker has been photographed in the past draped in a Palestinian flag.   The police bodycam footage has him going on an expletive-laced rant blaming the victim -- basically saying the victim shouldn't have been dressed like that.  It's Washington, which explains a lot. But it's still concerning how many leftists today can't control their emotions.",AlicesFlamingo,2025-04-19T09:39:19,38

"""Mahoney is a notorious far-left activist with strong ties to the Democratic Socialists of America and progressive labor groups. He publicly touts his admiration for the communist party, including wearing a hammer and sickle pin in his official school portrait"".  The above quote is from a news article that actually shows the picture.  Link gets memory-holed here.",Ironman650,2025-04-19T11:11:28,56

"Rhetorical question:  How would he have reacted if someone grabbed his flag and tossed it in the street and said ""go get it""?",Algum,2025-04-20T14:24:29,3
"If you left before covid (or before return to brick&mortar) then you missed a hell of a show (or shows.)  Chairs flying through the room one after another, people up the chain of command went into this room for a moment and came out looking like they were in a cage with random circus animals overnight. It was kindergarten.  Main character syndrome just keeps getting worse and worse, little kids are now raising their voices and shouting firmly at teachers telling them exactly how the class is supposed to be run (and not realizing summer school isn't the same as regular school.)  The way mainstream Reddit acts online is the way little kids with trash parents act IRL.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-19T11:19:40,12
"The scariest part is that ALL the materials they had available had a left wing bias (I used as much of my own sources as possible), and there were leftist teachers openly admitting that they shared email addresses and cellphone numbers with their students and encouraged them to call or text of they needed to talk. They would whip out the rainbow flag as soon as a kid questioned their sexuality instead of staying neutral, understanding that our age group was in a developmental stage in which they are figuring out their identities and may or may not *actually* be LGBTQ.",Dependent-Aside-9750,2025-04-19T15:29:35,3
