Laws against transpeople but not laws to keep kids safe.  Please explain so that someone who eats crayons can understand this.  I would think bodies of children in the hallway would be an issue the right would take up?  Pro-life et tu Brute?  Or just pro birth?,Nailbunny38,2025-04-23T20:27:53,9

"I remember a time when both Republicans and Democrats believed that criminals should **not** have guns. Presidents used to at least say they're working towards ending gun violence and removing guns from criminals.    25 or 30 years ago, violent criminals having easy access to guns was actually a big concern for people. Meanwhile,  people today believe that violent felons have the constitutional right to own AR-15s, because saying they can't own one is denying their right to overthrow a corrupt and tyrannical government.",x_xHaunter313,2025-04-23T20:52:04,1

"And the 2nd amendment was mainly added because the Founding Fathers feared the state ever infringing on militias. At the time, England used its large standing army to oppress the people. The English government mandated that the colonies must maintain the troops at colonists' expense. This meant that colonists who began to see themselves more and more as American rather than English had to house loyalist Redcoats in their homes or on their properties.   This was the infringement they were concerned about. But it became obvious that relying on militias instead of a standing army is a stupid idea during the War of 1812 and the Spanish War.",x_xHaunter313,2025-04-23T22:18:55,3
