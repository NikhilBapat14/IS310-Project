“chaos is itself a marker of success”  Just redefine success.   Such a simple way to solve life’s problems.,Gadshill,2025-04-23T03:51:12,17
>How Trump’s presidency can be a colossal failure and stunning success all at once  It can't - but with enough propaganda you can convince some of the people:  War is peace.  Freedom is slavery.  Ignorance is strength.  Welcome to the United States of Trumpistan.,Truthisnotallowed,2025-04-23T03:53:20,14

"What a hot crock of shit, CNN.   Every single thing Trump has done so far is in service to chaos, the destruction of American democracy and beshitting of the US constitution. The only entities that find this presidency a 'stunning success' are Putin and Russia.",biscuitarse,2025-04-23T05:08:27,4
"He will just pretend, that ""it is the greatest success ever!"" and  the MAGA-cultists will believe him, cheer at him and happily pay 10$ for 12 eggs.",Quarax86,2025-04-23T04:01:27,3

"Safety, security, order, wealth, expertise. So called integrity, honor and intelligence.   Those things were holding us back as a people.   They gave us the illusion of success, but true success comes when we strip all those things away. Those who cannot adapt will perish, but what survives will be stronger for it.   Those who arise in chaos will come together to build something new.   Something…orange.",specqq,2025-04-23T04:01:29,2

It's a raging success at keeping the elderly workforce engaged and non-retired. (Because their retirement savings are vanishing),neutrino71,2025-04-23T03:58:08,1
Because on occasion denocratic backsliding leads to a J-curve and improves long-term democratization? No. I don't know. Can't read the article.,fuckishouldntcare,2025-04-23T04:24:05,1

"I was one of those that was looking for buyers remorse, hoping trump insanity would finally register with his voters and cause a mass exodus but it hasn’t…..and it won’t. The other America needs to realize that there is no bringing this group back. trumps hate and chaos is what they want, it’s what they voted for. It took 40 plus years to sink this ship and it will take 40 plus years to right it even if the sensible side wins the next election….if there is one. The only ones that see trumps first 100 days as a colossal failure are those who didn’t vote for him. It’s a sad reality but it is what it is.",Kind_Relative812,2025-04-23T06:05:36,1

Just the fact that this is the guy who represents us is a monumental embarrassment and shame that will last forever.,Kantsas,2025-04-23T06:36:28,1
"Yeah, his base revels in all of these things that are horrific to sane people. The economy is weakening, but Trump fans hate globalism so they’ll accept a weaker economy. All of our allies are disappointed and grossed out by us, but Trumpers hate other countries and don’t care about having good relationships with them. Defunding science and universities is a disaster and risks losing our edge on technology but Trumpers hate science and experts so that’s a win in their eyes. ",StormOk7544,2025-04-23T08:00:38,1
