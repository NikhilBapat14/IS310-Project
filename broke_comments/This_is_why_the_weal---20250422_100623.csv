Elon isn’t paying anything like the taxes he should be though.,Old_Baldi_Locks,2025-04-22T10:25:01,35
Tariffs aren't going to replace income taxes though,FunkyChedda,2025-04-22T10:07:40,21
"Tariffs are an import tax. We need to step up our messaging and refer to them as the **Trump import tax** or the **Trump sales tax on imports**.   As a consumption tax, the Trump import tax is regressive. It's an intentional form of inflation by and for billionaires.   Dems really need to catch up to Republicans when it comes to nicknames and tags. They are effective in seizing the narrative. Low information voters who we need to win elections aren't going to spend 10 minutes reading a footnoted opinion piece by a PhD.",clamorous_owle,2025-04-22T10:52:15,8
"This is such a bad image and not because of any left/right stuff, it's just really bad if the goal is to convince people tariffs are harmful. This image implies that everyone benefits, when that isn't true. Literally no one benefits, even Elon Musk was not happy about the tariffs after a while. Yet that isn't the picture being painted.  \-$5,000 for income taxes and -$3 for food.  Compare that to $0 for taxes and $-10 for food. They saved $4,993. Which isn't the reality, but it's what the image implies.  It doesn't matter if Elon is benefiting too, who cares? You're still saying the average everyday person does as well.  Apologies but this photo is just bad.",imnota4,2025-04-22T10:35:10,9
"I imagine Elon just wakes up and there’s eggs in his fridge, he’s minimally involved in the grocery buying process.",pistilpeet,2025-04-22T10:39:01,2
"In 2017, Trump's first term, the Congress passes tax cuts, including 2% to the wealthiest American. Since then (and long before), America has been running a deficit. Those tax cuts are expiring at the end of this year. Congressmen worried about yearly deficits and the $36 trillion national debt are not going to renew the tax cuts. Trump's flawed plan is to say, ""We can keep the tax cuts, and maybe up them, because tariffs (and spending cuts) will make up for the lost govt revenue.""   Trump is trying to cut taxes to the wealthy, that is all he has ever cared about: his people.",callycumla,2025-04-22T15:59:45,2
"Democrats must stop calling them tariffs. These are a Trump Sales Tax, and every Democrat should say that every time they open their mouth. And yes, republicans want to get rid of income tax and make everything a sales tax, because sales taxes don’t harm their wallets.",Huckleberry199,2025-04-22T16:07:37,2
The average American cannot even begin to comprehend how much $1 billion is let alone $100 billion. How they can gladly give up 40% of what they make so a multibillionaire can give nothing is beyond me.,PaulClarkLoadletter,2025-04-22T13:20:41,1
"Republicans have been screaming, ""We can't afford this government!"" since Reagan.  Then, whenever they get in office, they pass tax cuts to make sure we can't afford it.",YallerDawg,2025-04-22T13:24:52,1
I like how that pretends income taxes would universally go away. Lol. Right.,BluXombie,2025-04-22T15:09:47,1
That would be funny if Elon actually paid anywhere near that in taxes. It would probably be more accurate to show him paying the same 5k in taxes as the normal guy (or possibly less).,Patient_Reach439,2025-04-22T16:46:48,1
"It's not the wealthy who confused me, it's the middle class voters who are fine with all of this",Rosebunse,2025-04-22T16:54:58,1
Rich people don't want tariffs. An extreme minority of kooks want tariffs. Musk was very publicly calling Navarro a moron just recently. No he doesn't care about the price of groceries but his businesses import a ton of materials and export to places like China and he stands to lose substantially on those fronts.,handsoapdispenser,2025-04-22T17:35:22,1

"Yeah, we're going to have our income taxed AND our goods tariffed.   I'm convinced the reason Trump is so big on tariffs is because it will help offset his massive tax decreases on the ultra wealthy.",louisianapelican,2025-04-22T10:13:51,30
"Not to mention that for tariffs to work and raise that kind of revenue, we would have to continue to import things at an even higher rate than we do now.   If the tariffs “work” and we produce most of our goods here, then there won’t be things to place tariffs on and we won’t raise the required revenue to replace the income tax.",thedudley,2025-04-22T12:04:58,3
That’s what their rhetoric seems to be. Trump is saying he wants to replace the Internal Revenue Service with the External Revenue Service. But you can’t support a modern state on tariffs. Poor people don’t have enough money.,bongophrog,2025-04-22T13:18:53,2
Nobody suggested that. But Trump.,DoTheRightThingG,2025-04-22T17:43:27,1
"I'm sorry if my image is misleading. It is not a $7 increase. It is a 225% increase on everything people buy.  So if a person spends $6k / year ($500 /month) on groceries, then that increases to $21k. So he saved $5k on taxes, but he spent an extra $15k on groceries.  Likewise, Elon's groceries go up $15k, but he saves $1 billion on his taxes. The wealthiest are the only winner in this scenario.",callycumla,2025-04-22T15:38:23,3
I don't think he cares about offsetting massive tax cuts for the wealthy,FunkyChedda,2025-04-22T10:21:31,8
What he said.   And will it work? No. Does Trump care? No.,callycumla,2025-04-22T15:31:24,3
"Rough numbers, the US Imported around 4T in goods and services, and raised about 2T in income tax  Does mango really think that if he tacks on a 50% tariff, that we will still have enough good imported into the US to provide sufficient revenue?

You're probably right. Why do you think he's so obsessed with tariffs? Like what's his deal?,louisianapelican,2025-04-22T10:34:22,4
"I would not be surprised if Trump produces a report saying his proposed tariff plan out earns income taxes, with all his numbers based on BS projections, and written by some right-wing economics hack.",callycumla,2025-04-22T16:02:56,2

He wanted to play mob boss. He thought the world leaders and corporate tycoons would line up to kiss his ring: https://www.salon.com/2025/04/08/theyre-kissing-my-ass-says-tariffs-are-going-great-promises-duty-on-pharmaceuticals/,srone,2025-04-22T11:07:11,5
I think it's easy for him to grasp and see and think of it as his personal business revenue/income.  Not only does it click with his business 101 brain it appears more disconnected than from personal income tax so there is less natural possessiveness about the money being lost from consumer's(in a good economy)perspective.   Maybe he also sees it as a hedge against a revolting population refusing to pay their income tax?,Primary-Path2504,2025-04-22T10:54:29,2
