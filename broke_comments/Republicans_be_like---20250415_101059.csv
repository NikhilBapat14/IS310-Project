"The DNC needs to stop trying to find logic in Republican voters and treat them like the cult they are.  They will NEVER cross party lines, and bending at the knee in an attempt to court them only hurts their own party and candidates.",boldandbratsche,2025-04-15T10:45:01,93
"Donald Trump and his brainwashed cult of mindless zombies called either MAGA or the Republicans cannot be reasoned with because they don't care and they have absolutely no morals.  They are turning America into a far-right, fascist, dystopian dictatorship and an idiocracy.  Those who were stupid enogh to vote for that poor excuse for a human being called Donald Trump and his fascist clowns deserve all of the bulls\*\*t that they will recieve.",Apprehensive_Idea758,2025-04-15T11:03:50,35

"From the accounts I'm seeing, republican voters are looking at the headlines themselves and deciding to turn away from the gop.  I'm guessing very very very few get convinced by a meme or points brought up in a small online conversation.",kapdad,2025-04-15T15:00:35,8

"It was maybe your imagination, but probably more that they were less overt in their bigotry and anti-democratic tendencies.
