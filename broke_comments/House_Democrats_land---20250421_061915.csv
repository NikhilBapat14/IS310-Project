"Thank you, Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., Rep. Yassamin Ansari, D-Ariz., and Rep. Maxine Dexter, D-Ore. And a big thanks to Senator Chris van Hollen. Democrats are finally flexing their muscles.",Obi1NotWan,2025-04-21T06:49:58,35
Great. Let's start talking about Merwil Gutiérrez and Andry José Hernández Romero too,AntoineDubinsky,2025-04-21T07:15:28,28
Let’s get this done ✅   Democrats - rolling up their sleeves to fix asshat’s incompetency…again.,WetFinsFine,2025-04-21T06:39:04,18
If we do manage to get him back what are the chances the trump administration just kidnaps him again?,WillyDAFISH,2025-04-21T08:08:00,15
Bad day for this with pope dying. Zero news coverage.,Raspberries-Are-Evil,2025-04-21T10:01:05,14
This is not an issue that’s going to make the people who didn’t vote now vote in the midterms. Middle of the road democrats like myself care about the economy and how you can improve the lives of our families. This is going to be another conservative commercial showing how out of touch this party is. I agree.,rhj2020,2025-04-21T15:26:06,-13
So thankful for these people who are truly representing the people.,amywhatsherface,2025-04-21T07:19:44,5
"Or maybe let’s keep focused on a narrative that’s landing, and use that to bring them all back",gringledoom,2025-04-21T07:17:51,19
"Agreed 100%. It’s not as if the others sent with him belong there. Which I feel this singular focus insinuates. Don’t get me wrong I’m very thankful that at least a few are stepping up on this issue, but Andry, Neri, and Merwil also need to be returned immediately. Clear open and shut shoddy work on their ‘gang affiliations’. And besides the clearly incorrect accusations, sending immigrants to a no contact prison without trial and sentencing is an absolute nightmare and I can’t believe how many Americans of all political persuasions just don’t seem to care all that much ",Calm_Pudding2684,2025-04-21T11:14:53,6
"Depending on which Dem politician you talk to, the current idea is to bring him, and all of the rest, back and then allow them to have their day in court. If, after that, that are still deemed deportable then they are to be deported to a country as free people.  If, after the court hearing they are deemed to be legit terrorists, criminals, etc., then they do time in a U.S. prison or jail.",crucial_geek,2025-04-21T11:39:00,10

Just because it won’t earn votes doesn’t mean you stop caring about due process and human rights.,wolf95oct0ber,2025-04-21T16:07:41,9
"Or maybe let's undercut their ""gangbanger"" bullshit by shifting the focus to victims who are even more sympathetic. And by the way, fuck the politics of it, these people need to be protected too.",AntoineDubinsky,2025-04-21T07:25:40,8
"I'm with u/AntoineDubinsky here, the point of all this isn't messaging, it's about right vs wrong. 75% of the people they deported were innocent, but you want to ignore them because you think focusing on one guy is a stronger message? You've lost the plot",Razhira,2025-04-21T12:48:38,1

I hope they have impeaching Trump and Vance somewhere in that plan.,MyStoopidStuff,2025-04-22T02:42:58,3
Ever heard of the phrase “changing horses in midstream”?,gringledoom,2025-04-21T07:53:35,3
"The problem is that the left tends to go off in 10,000 different directions out of a misplaced sense of moral rectitude, and the whole thing falls apart. E.g., the chaotic attempt to derail the Kavanaugh nomination.   You focus on what’s landing *because it’s landing*, which means it drives clicks, which means you keep getting headlines, which means lower info people think it’s a big deal, which means the needle moves, which means the El Salvador transfers become such a political loser both here and for Bukele that DHS can’t keep doing them.",gringledoom,2025-04-21T13:05:54,3
"If enough Dem Representatives win the House, they will.  But it will be a tough climb to win enough Senate seats in 2026 to convict.   I think they need to consider the bigger picture, though.  Impeaching Trump will only fire up his base and further fuel third-term aspirations, because, you know, he would be 'robbed' of full term and is owed.  I mean, he speaks as if he legit already won a third term, and because his second term was stolen, he should be allowed the third (because, he already won it).    But, this will gave Vance a solid year to prove his case, which could backfire for Dems or could backfire for him.   Allowing Trump to serve a full four years might be what is needed to wake up the other half of the country that this shit is not cool.",crucial_geek,2025-04-22T08:54:55,2

"For the dems or independents in 2026, It's gonna be an even tougher climb when the [field is tilted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru8SHK7idxs).  If Jan 6th has shown us anything, it should be that nothing is off the table for Trump, when to comes to holding onto power.",MyStoopidStuff,2025-04-23T07:36:22,1
