"It's really crazy the left has made an almost millionaire off of a murderer. They literally rewarded him for killing an innocent.   On another note, hoe scandal after scandal serves him the karma he deserves",LastManSleeping,2025-04-17T22:30:50,37

"Sure thatâ€™s why youâ€™ve bought new cars, upgraded your house and hired expensive security.  This story is so sickening for so many reasons.   If the roles were reversed and a white kid killed a black kid for being told to move there would be riots.  Instead the killer has a half million in donations and counting.  Heâ€™s being touted as some sort of victim and the poor kid he killed is being turned into the villain.",Pinot_Greasio,2025-04-17T21:22:53,122
They didnâ€™t even blink an eye as the money pours in. Itâ€™s almost like they donâ€™t care their kid murdered someone.,Long_Jelly_9557,2025-04-17T21:47:01,61

"The father of the murdered son needs to stay away. His interaction now, no matter how well intentioned, could cause difficulty when prosecuting his son's murderer.",TheConvincingSavant,2025-04-18T11:04:34,2

"He can't,  at least in the eyes of juvie court, unless he is charged as an adult. At best, he gets 25 to life. This is clearly a solid case for first degree murder, but the race hustlers will make this case into OJ 2.0. I just hope the jurors chosen will think with their minds, not their hearts.",charmaide,2025-04-17T23:48:08,16
He will be charged as an adult since he is 17 in Texas but Supreme Court ruled a 17 year old cannot receive the Death Penalty so that is off the table.Â ,FaptainAmericaTx,2025-04-18T09:20:42,6
