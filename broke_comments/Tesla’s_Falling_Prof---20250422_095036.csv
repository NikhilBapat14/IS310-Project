"Musk is so toxic at this point that returning to Tesla would continue to harm the company.  Dude really needs to just go away and never be heard from again.  The problem is if he does that, we do run a risk of a rich person trying to play shadow oligarch in the background.  Citizens United was such a fucking mistake.",teamdiabetes11,2025-04-22T09:53:40,91
"so what? he already did what he came to do -- infiltrate the gov't, install backdoors, and pillage the private data of every single american from every single database. he installed doge employees as his viceroys in every department so that even if he *does* leave, he isn't really.",oh-shazbot,2025-04-22T09:53:17,34

"can't uncook an egg.  He's shown who he is, and going back to Tesla rather than DOGE won't change how people view him and his company.

The whole board needs to go for enabling him. I’m not going to even consider a Tesla until Elon and everyone associated with him is gone from the company.  With how much stock he has that will probably be after he dies.,Ready_Nature,2025-04-22T10:26:37,1

"It's hilarious that people think him going back to Tesla would be good.  The guy is completely toxic, and has destroyed every bridge he had with the key demographics that actually buy his cars over the course of the last couple of years.  As long as he remains associated with Tesla, people are going to continue to boycott.  Given that he only owns 13% of the company, and the vast majority of his projected wealth is tied up in those shares, it's astonishing that other investors in Tesla haven't come together and staged a coup to remove him from the board and his position as CEO.  At this stage the company's stock is down 36% YTD - true it's still higher than where it was a year ago, but the trend is incredibly negative since the start of the year and the downward spiral continues.",verone3784,2025-04-22T11:30:44,1

I think one of the reasons he's leaving politics is because he already got what he wanted and that's all the governments information and doge in the system.   He's a Snake. He's going to slither away and avoid as much of the fallout as he can.

"> a rich person trying to play shadow oligarch in the background  The 1% have always been the shadow oligarchs...  >Citizens United was such a fucking mistake.  ...LONG before the CU ruling.   CU is just a first amendment issue and so it will never be addressed, nor should it be. CU is not the problem....anymore than ads for Coke vs. Pepsi are. ""Repeal CU"" is a red herring used by the Democratic politicians to claim they want to fix the system, but they really don't.   The real problem is money going directly to candidates to pay for multimillion dollar campaign ads on the very TV networks owned by the 1% who are the ones donating those millions to the DNC and RNC in the first place.   That's what has corrupted both of our political parties completely now. So much so that the billionaires not only don't fear the electorate anymore, they don't even fear or need the politicians now.  Want to fix America?  Public campaign financing. That's how the civilized world does it.",Supra_Genius,2025-04-22T18:15:55,1
