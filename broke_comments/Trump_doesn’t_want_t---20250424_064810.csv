Their wealth is all tied up in things which actually \*can't\* be moved out of the country: real-estate, companies, etc: assets. Assets are incredibly immobile. The rich person themself can leave the country, but they can't just rip up the apartment complexes, homes, and businesses they own and drag them with them.

"If you are rich, you'll still be paying taxes in the US unless the taxes in your new country are higher (on the very basic level).  In your uncle's situation, he probably made $125k, or less, so he never really owed taxes in the US (that is the cutoff for tax free exemption while working overseas and paying taxes there). When you are above that, you have to pay taxes on what you owe, unless the taxes you are paying in the country you are living on are higher than what you owe the US.  So, basically, your uncle was probably making less than $125k (or whatever the exact figure is) so he just never filed. He still is supposed to file taxes to the US each year even if he doesn't owe anything.  Most countries, for the rich, are going to owe a lot more money versus what they would owe in the US.

"> Lowering their personal tax rate is just so they can give more money to republicans in political spending  It's a mental health disease. They don't like paying taxes because they do not control how the money is dispersed back to society and to the people.    But they are OK with bribes to politicians. Which is kinda a tax but rich people think they are getting something for their money. It's an INVESTMENT. Not a bribe, not a tax. Taxes that go to the government that are spent on helping make the lives of people living in society better is not considered an investment. It's considered theft because rich people no longer control that money. For rich people taxes are not good because there is no direct and immediate return on their money that they were forced to relinquish.    Whereas most normal people see the benefit of helping people. Helping society. And believe it or not but some just like being nice to other people. That makes them happy.  Right now though Republicans are in control. It's full speed ahead with Project 2025 and Republicans are doing a speed run on USA because they know this is there last chance. Everything is on sale and if they have to burn down USA so what?
