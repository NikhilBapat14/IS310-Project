"***From Rolling Stone’s Tim Dickinson:***  When Teresa Borrenpohl was dragged out of an Idaho town hall in February over her aggressive questioning of Republican officials — by dark-clad men who refused to identify themselves — it seemed like a scene ripped from The Handmaid’s Tale, replete with a man on stage mocking her: “She spoke up, and now she doesn’t want to suffer the consequences.”  Read more: [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/teresa-borrenpohl-idaho-woman-town-hall-5-million-lawsuit-1235322366/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/teresa-borrenpohl-idaho-woman-town-hall-5-million-lawsuit-1235322366/)",rollingstone,2025-04-22T08:34:27,1062

"They won the popular vote by a super narrow margin for the first time in two decades, and thought they had the entire country ready to fall to the GOP's will right on its knees. Like, the fascist wing of the GOP smelt blood and instantly went for it. If media and academia and industry don't see this as an issue to prepare against in the future, the US *will* then crumble to a better prepared fascist movement in the future. It's not a matter of ""if"" now, but ""when"".     MAGA are now being beaten back, and the tailwinds from November will soon dissipate as the economy teeters on the brink and the lower judiciary remain nonplussed. The fascists have the right idea - destroy legal recourse for people by going after law firms - but the problem with their idea is that there are too many law firms to go after. The sheer volume of everything the GOP is facing now - legally and from the populace at large - should probably give them pause, but they're too deluded to smell the coffee, so it won't (which is a good thing).      But I'm amazed at this 100 day jackhammer taken to almost all walks of American life by the GOP, all resting on a grievance agenda by Trump and the deluded belief that they have a mandate.

"> I'm talking like a doctor losing their license. It should be occupation ending.   It is. In most states (maybe all?), being decertified as a peace officer in another state disqualifies you from being certified in that state too.   > Rotten cops can always move to another place.  Not if they have a criminal conviction, or have had their certification revoked to operate as a peace officer, which can be for any number of reasons, including excessive force findings.   The problems involved are the difficulty in actually getting the system to follow through with disciplinary actions to completion because of the deference given to law enforcement.

"> no effective way to stop a bad cop from just going to another jurisdiction and being hired.   > What I'm hearing, is that the system is supposed to but doesnt?  If the original agency would follow through...   If the guy resigns during the investigation and just moves, a lot of the time the agency just figures it's not their problem anymore, and if the DA decides it's not worth the charges and risking a jury acquitting, it just goes nowhere. And then the guy can just go to another jurisdiction and technically has no black marks on his record.
