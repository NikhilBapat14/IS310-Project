"I have said it once before and I will say it again, anybody who is a veteran who has actively served in war, should be able to come home and not have to pay for a home, not have to pay for medical insurance and sure as heck shouldn‚Äôt have to pay for any type of support services needed when they come back with PTSD or any other type of disease due to exposure to what they experienced during said war. We should be taking care of our veterans for putting their lives on the line for people, they don‚Äôt even know.",OrneryLetterhead8609,2025-04-19T13:25:10,2
"Phenomenal representation of all veterans; however, she is an outstanding roll-model for females currently serving and all us female veterans! Helicopter pilot in GWOT, lost her legs, and became a very vocal rep for all things supporting vets as a US Senator. She may piss people off but so what??? Being quiet does not get things accomplished.   I was part of the 5-24% of the females in my career field during my USAF aircraft maintenance career and wished there had been more women in higher positions. Luckily, I served for several outstanding female maintenance group, wing, and higher command officers. Sadly, there were more misogynistic men in those positions than women. If we spoke out, we were emotional and asked to see mental health for being anxious. (Most of the time I had significant health issues they had issues diagnosing, I was given a mental health appointment for ‚Äúmalingering‚Äù‚Ä¶faking my illnesses to get out of work!)",MsTgr,2025-04-19T15:37:43,2

Vietnam? Try the GWOT. And learn your wars before you post.,swordrat720,2025-04-18T04:52:01,2
"Yes, thanks for correcting me. She served in the Iraq war. She‚Äôs an incredible woman‚Ä¶a real inspiration. I want to hear more from her. I hope we see her in more news programs and rallies.",BikingInPangea,2025-04-18T08:05:36,5
