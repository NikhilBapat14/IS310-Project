"Good grief. This story is horrible. Yet another story about the trump administration's cruelty toward immigrants. Seems like there's a new story every day.  There was just [another story recently](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/us/venezuela-immigrant-disappear-deport-ice.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Bk8.kC6-.xKOnPRicB6BB&smid=url-share) about an immigrant who was doing food delivery and took a wrong turn here and got arrested... and he disappeared! No one knows where he is!!  And the horrors keep coming:  >Of those detained there have been a dozen families - one family was held for 12 days, with two American citizen children. Lawyers with the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center say they do not currently know the whereabouts of the children, and have requested further information.  >...  >Sarahi says what followed her arrest ""felt like a kidnapping."" She told NPR that her family was placed in a windowless office space near the bridge. For close to six days, she said they were given no access to a lawyer, told to sleep on cots without proper accommodations for the children (no diapers or appropriate food). She says a few days in, her children began to get sick, and there was no first aid available.",sachiprecious,2025-04-24T09:51:08,10

"Anyone local knows how easily this can happen! We call it “the forbidden exit”. Once you’re on it, there’s no way off unless you fake car trouble and call for a tow.",linderlady,2025-04-24T10:31:10,4
"I mean, that's not even the meat of the story. Sure, wrong turn leads to ICE arrest is bad but how about being held for long periods of time and you can't even be found because there's no info on you of the site you're held at?  >NPR has been receiving tips about immigrants and their children detained at the office space by the Ambassador Bridge for months – people who accidentally drive onto the toll plaza, as well as migrants seeking asylum in Canada who are turned back and end up detained in these office spaces for extended periods of time. But lawyers with the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center and ACLU of Michigan were unable to locate people in detention or who had been held there.  >At Thursday's press conference, Miriam Aukerman, senior staff attorney with the ACLU of Michigan said detentions at the site had been ""a complete blackhole of information."" She also stated that ""it is naive to think that if we tolerate incommunicado detentions for non-citizens, the government won't be doing the same for citizens.""",cowboycoco1,2025-04-24T10:50:56,7
"That’s crazy , so when you approach the Canadian entry gates there is no U turn permissible to return to USA??? I lived in San Diego and both the Otay Mesa and San Ysidro border crossings offer U turns to return to USA. Damn !!! ( I’ve haven’t been back in over a decade so don’t know if it’s still an option)",Robmore1,2025-04-24T18:33:58,1
"Disappearing people is something many countries are known for, like China, Russia, North Korea, pretty much any dictatorship in central and south America, etc. Sad to see that the USA has joined the ranks of those countries.",noncongruent,2025-04-24T11:42:34,3
