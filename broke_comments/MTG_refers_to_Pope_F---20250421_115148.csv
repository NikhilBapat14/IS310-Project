"I have a theory.          There‚Äôs a certain demographic‚ÄîMarge types, if you will‚Äîwho aren‚Äôt reacting to ‚Äúmoral decay‚Äù or ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù or whatever the outrage du jour is. What they‚Äôre really grappling with is the slow, public erosion of their automatic authority.            For most of their lives, they operated under the unspoken contract that their opinions were the default, their identity was ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù and their worldview was rarely questioned‚Äîcertainly not by the people they saw as beneath them.              But now? Thanks to the internet, shifting generational values, and a society increasingly uninterested in deference-for-deference‚Äôs-sake, they‚Äôre no longer the main characters. And instead of adapting, they‚Äôve decided to retaliate.               They won‚Äôt say it outright. They may not even realize it. But their politics have curdled into something bitter and nihilistic‚Äînot because they want to fix anything, but because they‚Äôd rather watch the world burn than live in one they don‚Äôt control.             It‚Äôs not about patriotism.         It‚Äôs not about faith.           It‚Äôs about power‚Äîand the tantrum that follows when it slips away.",Ok_Singer_5210,2025-04-21T13:16:09,4

"I was thinking about this yesterday, but in relation to Nancy Mace and Megyn Kelly. But it applies to Marge too.  What all of these people have in common is that they seem to have suffered what most people would classify as abuse. Nancy and Megyn acknowledge the abuse, but Marge is in denial about it.   But all three of these people become, in turn, abusers. They are classic examples of people who feverishly defend a system they perceive themselves benefiting from, despite the fact that the system abuses them. They would suffer the whip to enjoy the spoils.  For all three of them, in relation to what you‚Äôre saying, they believe that if, say, things were made better for women, this would create more competition in the system. They know deep down that there are people who can do what they do much better than they can, who don‚Äôt succeed because they won‚Äôt play the game.  Abuse victims sometimes perpetuate abuse. They weaponize their suffering to use against others. Marge weaponize her ignorance, Nancy and Megyn weaponize sexual assault.
