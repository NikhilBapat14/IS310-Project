"I have a theory.          There’s a certain demographic—Marge types, if you will—who aren’t reacting to “moral decay” or “cancel culture” or whatever the outrage du jour is. What they’re really grappling with is the slow, public erosion of their automatic authority.            For most of their lives, they operated under the unspoken contract that their opinions were the default, their identity was “normal,” and their worldview was rarely questioned—certainly not by the people they saw as beneath them.              But now? Thanks to the internet, shifting generational values, and a society increasingly uninterested in deference-for-deference’s-sake, they’re no longer the main characters. And instead of adapting, they’ve decided to retaliate.               They won’t say it outright. They may not even realize it. But their politics have curdled into something bitter and nihilistic—not because they want to fix anything, but because they’d rather watch the world burn than live in one they don’t control.             It’s not about patriotism.         It’s not about faith.           It’s about power—and the tantrum that follows when it slips away.",Ok_Singer_5210,2025-04-21T13:16:09,4

"As much as I dislike her, she's not completely wrong.   Francis did just about nothing to stem the sexual abuses by his clergy and the mantra during his reign as Pope has been to settle these cases out of court and try to hide the damage.

By allowing it to continue and trying to sweep it under the rug he essentially condoned the sexual abuse and rape of children. That's pretty damn evil in my book.",Gedwyn19,2025-04-21T18:23:46,2

"I do not support any statement by that person. Where she’s coming from and whom she’s directing these comments to are the people that believe the Catholic Church is the “whore of Babylon” referred to in the book of revelations. This trope is a favorite in evangelical churches. However, if she was a card carrying, true bible thumping type instead of celebrating she be more concerned with the next one, because the one that just passed had credentials that would indicate that he was the “last” of the “decent” popes to come. It’s all about ushering in Jesus, as if Jesus would truly need assistance of any sort. Again, was raised from age 5 in that “cult / culture” and not making excuses for them, just lending an assist to understanding the line of belief.

Personally this is even a bit of a grievance i had with him, because it continues tje trend of underrepresentation of latin america in church hierarchy, despite being the largest pool of faithfuls (like brazil has almost 2x as many faithfuls as USA, or 3x as italy, but we have 1/2 and 1/3 of the cardinals then these countries respectively).",firechaox,2025-04-21T13:25:38,2

"I was thinking about this yesterday, but in relation to Nancy Mace and Megyn Kelly. But it applies to Marge too.  What all of these people have in common is that they seem to have suffered what most people would classify as abuse. Nancy and Megyn acknowledge the abuse, but Marge is in denial about it.   But all three of these people become, in turn, abusers. They are classic examples of people who feverishly defend a system they perceive themselves benefiting from, despite the fact that the system abuses them. They would suffer the whip to enjoy the spoils.  For all three of them, in relation to what you’re saying, they believe that if, say, things were made better for women, this would create more competition in the system. They know deep down that there are people who can do what they do much better than they can, who don’t succeed because they won’t play the game.  Abuse victims sometimes perpetuate abuse. They weaponize their suffering to use against others. Marge weaponize her ignorance, Nancy and Megyn weaponize sexual assault.  It’s a sad cycle, and it’s easy to see once you know what you’re looking for. Bullies need to feel powerful. And sometimes the weak only dream of being bullies.",rjrgjj,2025-04-21T16:45:45,1

The number of times I’ve been told that as a Catholic I’m not a Christian. I stopped laughing after the 6th or 7th time. This nation is quickly sliding into a Church-state. I can name a few that didn’t end well over the years. I hope she goes with it when it falls.,WarriorGma,2025-04-21T21:36:43,1

My understanding is that people who believe in God believe God works through people.  I think everybody believes something just about like that whether they'd put it in religious terms or not.  I don't know why someone would choose to think realizing their idea of a better world couldn't stand to use their own assistance.  At least that bit of criticism I'd say is unfair.,agitatedprisoner,2025-04-21T20:30:52,1

"You’re right. I was just pointing out the irony that the Pope is supposed to be this superior figure in Catholicism, yet many didn’t like him just because he had more progressive views. Same people who openly ignore things that Jesus said about caring for the poor and downtrodden. I guess personal feelings and hating on minorities matter more than divine authority.
