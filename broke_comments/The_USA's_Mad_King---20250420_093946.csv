"Its sad with all the ""coastal liberal elites"" insults,.. sort of reveals how the split in society is between:  * the people who believe in science and evidence and facts and intelligently and methodically testing things to find good effective solutions  and  * the other people who think ""bullying and dominance over others is the only answer"".

"Am I to understand that you believe the only way to influence someone is if you have more money than they do?   If someone has 8% of your income, you think that would prevent them from mugging you?

Everyone clearly sees the way Trump has kowtowed to Putin for years now.  Whether or not Putin has influence on Trump is not really even debatable at this point.  I suppose just how much influence Putin has is what can be discussed.  Let's also not forget that Russia is a significant part of the American media misinformation machine. They have been influencing American sensibilities on social media for over a decade.,Eli_Fit,2025-04-20T16:44:23,6

"I can't tell if you are trolling me by being willfully obtuse.  Ongoing polarisation of global societies?  Well, Russia is outcast by the democratic, civil societies on a global scale because he is a dictator in the midst of a hostile takeover of a sovereign nation as well as a threat to global safety and order with goals of restoring the old Soviet Union.  And now he has found an ally in Trump and the US government, thereby significantly lowering our standing in the world, our global image and trustworthiness.  If you don't think this is a significant factor in the ""current ongoing polarisation of global societies"", you are either ignorant, dishonest, or both.
