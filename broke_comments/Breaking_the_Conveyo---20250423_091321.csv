He actually believes any American economic policy not based on Tariffs is for losers and has publicly expressed this belief hundreds of times before he ever ran for anything, starting in the  mid 80's.     Remember we are  talking about a guy who bankrupted casinos here.",mothman83,2025-04-23T09:21:43,3
"And a proven deal breaker and reneger. Which begs the question, why are intelligent bankers letting his maundering affect the market?
