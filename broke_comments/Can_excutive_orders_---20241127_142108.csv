"There's a few questions in here that I'm going to parse out.   * Can the president create tariffs?   Yes, but you're not alone in being confused. The Constitution gives taxation powers to Congress in Article I, Section 8, ""Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises."" However, as you can see from [this wikipedia article on Trump's tariffs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_tariffs#Legality), Congress passed two laws in the 70s saying that the president can create tariffs. Some of that appears to be in dispute but not enormously so.   * What are the limits of executive orders?   Consider that the president's job is to execute the laws that Congress has passed. Congress has passed laws that give the president the ability to create tariffs, the president can then execute Congress's will by creating whatever tariffs they see fit.   The broader issue is that Congress has ceded more and more of its legislative authority to the president over the preceding decades. The reason why is complicated and beyond what can be adequately explained by me, but it can be summed up with partisan gridlock and a slow to react legislature.",colorfulpony,2024-11-27T21:17:30,11
