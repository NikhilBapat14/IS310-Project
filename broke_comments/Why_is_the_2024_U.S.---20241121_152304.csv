"The votes to be counted aren't distributed evenly. There are a _lot_ more small counties than large counties, and small counties' votes are easier and faster to count.  As an example: the smallest county in Texas (Loving County) has a population of 94. The largest, Harris County, has a population of 4,835,125. They certainly don't have 50,000 times as many people _counting_ votes in Harris county, so the rate is necessarily slower. (see https://www.texas-demographics.com/counties_by_population.)",cephalotesatratus,2024-11-21T16:32:08,27

Counter point - Florida had virtually [the entire state counted (99%)](https://apnews.com/article/election-california-wait-times-vote-count-florida-170cb591062f8fad8f619b2cc02ff3e7) on election day.  I can be done if the systems and processes are put into place.  Florida got embarrassed in 2000 and fixed it.,LordFoxbriar,2024-11-21T17:02:37,23
Florida starts processing absentee and mail-in ballots earlier than any other state. That's just what they do. But that doesn't mean some races still take longer to count due to recounts and lawsuits.,DidjaSeeItKid,2024-11-21T17:43:22,21
Yup. This should be talked about as a set of policies that create this mess.   FL starts counting mail in votes as soon as they arrive. Other states cannot (by law) even open the envelope until polls close on Election Day.   That’s a choice by lawmakers.,thisfunnieguy,2024-11-21T18:05:08,15
I think Florida requires mail in ballots be received by the day of election. Some of other states allow ballots to be received a days after.,randonumero,2024-11-22T07:44:52,3
"It’s FloriDuh, They did the count before the election.",ConcordGrape73,2024-11-22T13:17:30,1
>That’s a choice by lawmakers.  It was especially egregious during and after 2020. Republicans were blocking legislation aimed at allowing earlier processing of mail ballots *and* pushing conspiracy theories about foul play because mail ballots took too long to count.,LivefromPhoenix,2024-11-21T20:49:31,10
"Yeah--other policies that lead to slow vote counting are:  * accepting mail-in ballots after the election as long as they're post-marked by election day--a big issue in Alaska where postal service from rural places to the place where votes are counted can be very slow, and to a lesser extent across a lot of the west where voting by mail is very popular because polling places can be a long way away  * signature verification--tends to slow down the process considerably  * [allowing ballots to be cured](https://www.npr.org/2022/09/27/1125179062/voting-explainer-in-many-states-theres-a-process-to-fix-an-error-with-your-ballo)--some states have a process to allow voters to fix issues with their ballot (like they forgot to sign the envelope) and usually they have until several days after the election to do this",anneoftheisland,2024-11-22T14:37:24,1
"yes, and now some states have longer processing times because of onerous processes around things like signature matching, etc..  politicians can talk about fixing this, and it is a fixable problem  states like Colorado send EVERYONE a mail in ballot at the start of the election.  FL might be the faster counting per capita state.",thisfunnieguy,2024-11-21T21:01:53,2
