"The worst part of this is that if conservatives every caused this much damage,  the entire country would be panicking like they did with the proud boys and there would be actual consequences.  Left wing terrorism is both protected and allowed in this country.  **Edit:**  I love it when people DM me walls of text instead of just replying to my comment.  Why don't you share with the rest of the class?  **Edit 2:**  No, ""but J6"" isn't an argument.  The J6 overreaction and jailing of people who didn't do violence or even go in to the capitol actually shows how overzealous democrats are when given power.  But thanks for the random pictures of J6 in DMs lol.  **Edit 3:** People who have decorated reddit logos on their profile are cringe.

I am concerned that this violence from the left will continue to escalate. Yet the liberal media keeps saying right wing extremism and white males are the violent ones.   Something will happen and this liberal violence will get the wrong person killed and things will get worse. ,Long_Jelly_9557,2025-04-14T11:31:22,49

Conservatives don't avoid left wing subs. We are banned from them. And not just left wing subs but all the supposedly neutral ones as well. Contrast that to this sub where top comments from so called cnservatives regularly spew the left's talking points and are allowed to do so. Apparently your viewpoint is still considered conservative here when it mimics democrat talking points exactly.,day25,2025-04-14T12:48:48,13
