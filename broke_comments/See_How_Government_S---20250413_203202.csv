"I quickly skimmed. I didn't think the article was anti Trump...remember, the administration has only been in power 3 months. You really can't expect big cuts to happen that quickly.    Anyway, this is what it said.   Social Security, medicare, medicaid, and high interest on debt is up. That's to be expected. Our people are older and are collecting more benefits. And we're paying more interest on more debt. Trump hasn't touched those things yet. It's just the natural progression of things.   It does show what Trump has done to decrease spending has been a success: DOE expenses are down, so is TSA and USAID.   The article also explains that while DOGE has done somethings - namely all the fed gov worker cuts - we haven't seen the effects of that yet since they're still on payroll, severance payouts etc.   I thought it was a fair assessment. But again, too early perhaps. ",findunk,2025-04-13T21:27:40,116
"If anyone hasn't noticed, when the government does a Continuing Budget Resolution, they end up spending MORE than they would have if a proper budget had been passed.  It is high time we stopped letting them scare us with the Social Security and other boogeymen that are patently false.  Back during Trump's first term the Government was shutdown for 35 days. Socials Security payments were NOT interrupted, .  During the 2018-2019 government shutdown, paychecks were interrupted for some military personnel. Specifically, about 41,000 active-duty Coast Guard members, 6,000 reservists, and 8,500 civilian employees did not receive their paychecks because the Coast Guard falls under the Department of Homeland Security, not the Defense Department.  During the 2013 shutdown, Congress passed legislation that allowed uniformed personnel to receive their paychecks during the shutdown, but this statute was limited to ""members of the Armed Forces,"" excluding USPHS and NOAA Corps officers.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-14T12:53:27,6
"For anyone who failed civics, the budget for fiscal year 2025 was passed last year and signed by Biden. The budget Republicans are working on would apply to fiscal year 2026.",dunkeater,2025-04-13T20:53:52,76
"I'll be the one to say it... The savings are secondary to me.  What's of primary importance to me is tearing down the rotten structure.  I'll take the savings, don't get me wrong, but what I really want to see is the house of the swamp creatures bulldozed to the ground so we can put up something worth a damn in its place.",Shadeylark,2025-04-14T11:14:53,7

45% of spending is the military and the world's most expensive healthcare system.  Until those two get a haircut this isn't changing the trajectory of the budget one bit.,Jonger1150,2025-04-19T14:58:38,1

Oh no! The price of eggs didn’t immediately drop as soon as Trump was put into office…!  We won’t see any cost saving in government for at least another 3-6 months. And even then most of the budget cuts will take effect next year to really see the larger effect.,Iamstillhere44,2025-04-14T08:36:53,-6
Spending would have been higher if not for DOGE.,JTuck333,2025-04-14T06:05:02,-11
"You’re going to barely notice the fed worker cuts. All fed civilian employees make up only about 4 percent of annual spend. This isn’t to say what DOGE is doing isn’t necessary, but rather that it’s not surprising they’ve had so little impact. Real meaningful reform in federal spending must come from Congress.",ConfusionFlat691,2025-04-13T21:49:51,232
"So DOGE numbers are meaningless, then.  When can we judge how much budget Trump has cut?",Pertinacious,2025-04-13T23:43:01,69

"That's why you need to compare DOGE savings to total discretionary spending. 2023 saw $1.7T versus DOGE's $150b in savings. It's definitely trimming around the edges, but it's a great start. Your overall point is right, but I wouldn't sneeze at that $150b as it would compound into way more over the next decade if it weren't cut.",cplusequals,2025-04-13T23:28:50,1
It's an important piece to reduce overall spending.,kaytin911,2025-04-13T23:02:23,-6
"That doesn’t follow at all.  DOGE is doing audits on the spending authorized by Biden, finding fraud/waste in the hundreds of billions that they want to cut. They are still fighting in court to determine whether the executive branch can stop payments authorized by Congress or if money allocated must be spent regardless of merit.  It is up to Congress to make the cuts recommended by DOGE permanent. As for gauging real impact, it’ll take to the end of next year to have a concrete, non estimated understanding.",dunkeater,2025-04-14T00:06:12,9

So we won't know if DOGE has saved us any money until the end of 2026 is what you're saying.  About what you'd expect from the feds.,Pertinacious,2025-04-14T00:11:52,47

"No, we can know some money was saved judging from individual cuts as they make them. We won’t know the total effect until the end of 2026 for the first year.  It’s the same in the private sector. You can estimate expenses and revenue but results aren’t known for sure until the accounting is done.",dunkeater,2025-04-14T00:19:48,-5
I have fun with it when they follow me around now. They are clearly authoritarian losers.,kaytin911,2025-04-14T07:43:09,-3
"Do we though? Under scrutiny, their cuts keep changing, and I don't know how much they're costing us either.  You reference the private sector, but it's pretty clear they're operating under an entirely different set of rules. Just another federal agency that's sucking up taxpayer dollars with vague promises.",Pertinacious,2025-04-14T00:55:13,82

"Lol ok, ""libertarian"". Whats your alternative? The last time we cut government employees was during the Clinton era, 30 years ago, and it was via a similar method.",funny_flamethrower,2025-04-14T08:18:03,-18
