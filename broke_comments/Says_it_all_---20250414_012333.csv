"The ""everything is so expensive"" argument is just because they don't want to say that the reason they love the Republicans is the racism and hatred. Good ""Christians"", you know.",shastadakota,2025-04-14T01:34:05,117
"This one really drives me nuts. Plus since they have no argument against it, they deny ever complaining about prices. It was half a year ago unlike them I don‚Äôt have the memory of a goldfish",blellowbabka,2025-04-14T05:27:53,22

I was at a bar watching the masters yesterday and the people next to me were saying that trump would win the masters easily.  Maga are beyond delusional in there worship of him.,wylie99998,2025-04-14T17:39:18,10

Absolutely wild how they lie and gaslight everyone when they push back with sound reasoning and data,Kind-City-2173,2025-04-14T13:31:32,9
Never look for logic from a conservative.  And never trust that what they‚Äôre saying is what they actually think or believe.  Absolutely every single last part of their entire existence is based on their absurd belief that they have been marginalized or bullied by some perceived enemy.  Trump taps into their desire for revenge on their enemies.,Eradicator_1729,2025-04-14T19:12:20,9

How do I beat the ‚Äúmaybe prices ARE coming down‚Äù allegations?? My mom is constantly coming home from the grocery store like ‚Äúoh my god look how cheap this stuff was I fucking love trump‚Äù and I just have no idea how to make her realize that maybe that‚Äôs not the only fucking thing jeopardy????,bananasban,2025-04-14T12:48:13,3
"They're only pissed about everything being so expensive if they can perform the necessary mental gymnastics to pin it on the Democrats. It leads me to believe that Conservatives were never outraged about the cost of living to begin with, they just had to have something to blame on Biden.",LoudCrickets72,2025-04-15T00:29:36,5

"That has something to do with the fact that not a single Trump supporter, not a one, supported him because they wanted the country to be better. They claim that is the reason in order to hide their real reason, but not even the most brain dead Trump supporter supports Trump because of the price of groceries or anything else. They supported Trump because they wanted to be able to be bigots without consequences, that's it. They don't even care and won't care that the leopards eat their faces off so long as the people they've decided to hate for no reason get their faces bitten off first.",immortalfrieza2,2025-04-18T18:09:12,2
"Would these Maga conservatives still be smiling if a pardoned January 6 terrorist got rounded up and was deported to a work camp in El Salvador? Dozens of the pardoned are still facing pending charges from previous crimes they committed. From child sexual abuse to manslaughter. Like Peter Schwartz who had 38 previous convictions for things like assault with a deadly weapon, domestic violence, terroristic threats and battery. Or maybe the lady who killed a mother and severely injured the father in a drunk driving accident. Trump said he had no problem sending off American citizens who had committed serious crimes.  Wouldn‚Äôt it be ironic?",Zen-platypus,2025-04-15T13:39:41,1

They are willing to pay more if the goal is to ‚Äúown the libs‚Äù. Look at how much money they send to the circus peanut to pay for his legal fees.,johnnyhandbags,2025-04-14T14:21:32,13

"Sorry for a little rant. I believe my son is in this cult. His father continues to be in denial, telling me he‚Äôs just joking when he takes the republicans/trump administration‚Äôs side. I cannot have a conversation with him where he doesn‚Äôt compare what trump is doing to the biden regime. I finally made a point when I said, Biden didn‚Äôt go to the golf course every weekend, charging 3.3 million to Americans every time. And, Biden didn‚Äôt charge the government for SS (secret service) staying at his hotels and pocketing the money. He, still retorts back something smarty. I don‚Äôt want to talk to him, but sometimes I do. I believe his gf and her family have indoctrinated him into orange thinking.",Istunus,2025-04-15T10:31:38,8

"A vast majority of these people are the bullies, the haters, the violent individuals who were given permission to come out of the shadows because of the words and the actions of an individual who was known as an adulterer, a failed businessman (sued over 3000 times by investors) with six bankruptcies and a sexual predator long before he even ran for president the first time.  Then he became a convicted felon, and they still voted for him again.  These are the people looking to blame someone else for their own miserable lives. Why do you think the ‚ÄúKarens‚Äù suddenly started appearing?     King Donnie, the Royal Dick  is who they were waiting for. He wasn‚Äôt even a decent human being. What made them think he would be a decent president.",Zen-platypus,2025-04-15T14:13:58,5
"I would explain that if the prices on this one product are down at this one store, that it is DESPITE Trump and not because of him.  More variable's go into each items price than who the president is.  And Trump's policies almost encourage price gouging by corporations.  The tariff bullshit alone will raise prices on imported items like fruits, veggies, candy, coffee, and other packages goods.  Steel and aluminum tariffs can increase the cost of canned foods.  Tariffs can also disrupt supply chains leading to food shortages, further raising the prices.  And if your mom is like most Trumpers, she'll shrug and act like she didn't hear shit you just said, and continue on giving him credit for the sky being blue, even though he's polluting the fuck out of it. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",Eli_Fit,2025-04-14T14:28:15,4

I would much rather MAGA just admit that they support Trump because they want to be hateful bigots without consequences and that's the end of it. That would at least be honest.,immortalfrieza2,2025-04-18T18:12:06,2
