"The GOP is a Russian criminal organization. They share the same values and try to help each others. Putin will control Europe, Trump America and Xi Asia.  They want a dictators oligarchs world order.",NorthenFreeman,2025-04-23T17:05:03,16
"For what it's worth, Ukraine has been clear they will not accept the terms here.   And in my opinion, I hope they never will accept any terms that gives Russia an advantage or moment to recuperate.   War is horrible, but what about all the lives, both Ukrainian, European and quite a few none European, lost in the conflict? Are their sacrifices going to be in vain?  Furthermore, any kind of peace deal would ultimately be useless as Russia will break the peace once they have gotten the manpower and gold back. Just like they did during the Easter treaty.  No… If I were Zelensky, I would rather salt the land than give even the the tiniest of creeks in the forest to the shithole that is Russia.",Affectionate_Mix5081,2025-04-23T17:12:33,14
I say we just get VP Pance to have one-on-one talks with Putin. Let’s use his *death curse* for good.,heismanwinner82,2025-04-23T17:09:22,8
I don't know why its being called a 'peace plan' like it actually means something.  Hitler had a peace plan too.,Jasonicca,2025-04-23T17:38:52,6
">*July 31, 2016*  >Donald Trump said that the people of Russia-annexed Crimea appear to want to remain under Russia's control –- and that a President Trump would ""look at"" whether the U.S. would recognize Russian control of the territory.  >""I'm gonna take a look at it,"" Trump told ABC News' George Stephanopoulos in an interview on ""This Week"" Sunday. ""But you know, the people of Crimea, from what I've heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were. And you have to look at that, also.""  >[https://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/trump-crimeas-people-prefer-russia-elected-putin-ukraine/story?id=41029437](https://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/trump-crimeas-people-prefer-russia-elected-putin-ukraine/story?id=41029437)  The White House is now a primary source of Kremlin talking points.  It's a bit amusing and probably not a coincidence that the name of Trump's social media platform is Truth Social, while the name of one of the Soviet Union's main propaganda newspapers was Pravda (Truth).  Liars are passionate about their desire for others to believe them.",I405CA,2025-04-23T17:19:44,4

"Not shocked. The trump-putin ties go way too deep. Trump knee there was Russian interference in the 2016 election and rather than speak up, he let it happen because it benefitted him.",A012A012,2025-04-23T22:07:53,1
"In addition to the GOP's problems, Vance is a special case.  He is fundamentally a hollow man, and no one can exploit that better than Putin.  It's a lot of trouble for a person as empty as Vance to come up with original solutions or even to comprehend a situation; it's so much easier to allow someone else to influence you and tell you what to think.",RLT1950,2025-04-23T22:47:08,1
