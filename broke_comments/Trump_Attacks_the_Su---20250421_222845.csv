"This what AI told me  Illegal immigrants in the U.S. are entitled to certain due process rights under the Constitution, primarily because the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments apply to all ""persons"" within U.S. jurisdiction, not just citizens. The Supreme Court has consistently ruled that non-citizens, regardless of legal status, have procedural protections when facing government actions like deportation or detention.  Key points: - **Deportation proceedings**: Illegal immigrants have the right to a hearing before an immigration judge, notice of charges, the ability to present evidence, and the opportunity to appeal decisions in most cases. This stems from cases like *Zadvydas v. Davis* (2001), which affirmed due process in removal proceedings. - **Detention**: Detainees must receive a bond hearing to determine if detention is justified, and prolonged detention without review may violate due process (*Demore v. Kim*, 2003). - **Criminal proceedings**: If charged with a crime, illegal immigrants have the same rights as citizens, including the right to a fair trial, counsel, and protection against self-incrimination (*Wong Wing v. United States*, 1896). - **Limitations**: Due process rights are narrower for non-citizens at the border or those who have not formally ""entered"" the U.S. (*Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei*, 1953). Expedited removal processes may also limit procedural protections for recent arrivals.",Key_Law4834,2025-04-22T03:35:59,-29

"*Narcissistic rage is the reaction a narcissistic person has to a perceived threat. Someone experiencing narcissistic rage may lash out aggressively, retreat into a cold silence, or use manipulation to regain their sense of control and superiority over a person or a situation.*  *People with narcissism often struggle to maintain stable self-esteem and are highly sensitive to any perceived threats to their self-worth. The rage can stem from their deep-seated need to defend their self-image and is usually disproportionate to the situation and feels unwarranted by witnesses to the rage. Unlike typical anger, which usually has a clear and proportionate cause, narcissistic rage can be brought on by any event that‚Äôs interpreted as being negative toward them ‚Äî even if it‚Äôs minor or unintended.*  *It‚Äôs important to note that those on the receiving end of narcissistic rage may feel as though they‚Äôre the problem or cause for this form of anger. They‚Äôre not. Narcissistic rage‚Äîand NPD‚Äîis solely a reflection on the person with this disorder.

"What I think people should understand is that Trump isn‚Äôt judged according to the same standard as a typical Democrat because he‚Äôs proposing to run the executive branch and the office of the president in a fundamentally different way than a Democrat.  Democrats hold the rule of law, equal justice, due process, etc. as the standards to which they aspire.  And their voters want them in office because they embody, at the very least, the aspiration toward fulfilling those ideals.  Thus, when they fall short of attaining those standards, they are judged according to their failures to live up to those standards.  Trump supporters, on the other hand, in many ways value the complete opposite of that: defying what they believe is a corrupt judiciary; consolidating power within the executive under Trump to exercise autocratic rule; targeting enemies and ‚Äúundesirables‚Äù for swift and harsh treatment.  Thus, he is evaluated by his own supporters according to whether he lives up to *those* standards.  On other words, defying SCOTUS and setting up a constitutional crisis isn‚Äôt a bug for them - it‚Äôs a feature.  It shouldn‚Äôt surprise anyone that under a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù presidency, those kinds of things would never be tolerated.  Of course that‚Äôs true.  But his supporters - including even a lot of tepid, lukewarm supporters - don‚Äôt want him to have a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù presidency if it means getting things done, cutting through red tape and delivering the results they (think) they want. That‚Äôs the extremely terrifying battle we‚Äôre waging now - against an uncomfortably large number of voters who simply don‚Äôt care anymore to uphold things like the rule of law, co-equal branches of government, federalism, separation of powers, etc. Sorry for the wall of text but it should be apparent why Democrats are judged according to stricter standards - because by aspiring and adhering to those standards, they expose themselves to judgment based on violations (real or perceived) of those same standards in a way Trump doesn‚Äôt.",PerniciousPeyton,2025-04-22T11:02:08,1

"Thank you for the challenge. I'm always happy to take one on.  The point of the allegory in the poem is clear. Precedent is about credibility, trust, and predictability. These are the currency of the judiciary. *Stare decisis* is not merely a nice doctrine but is fundamental to the viability of the Court as an institution.  When the Court begins to overrule precedent to satisfy every ideological itch, it erodes the value of past decisions just as the Fed devalues the dollar by printing money. Eventually, the Court‚Äôs word no longer settles law; it simply reflects transient voting power. When that happens, even *Marbury* becomes vulnerable. The Court‚Äôs power does not come from five votes; it comes from the trust and predictability of a coherent body of law and the belief that Justices act in good faith within that precedent.  The Roberts Court has chosen to inflate that away.  In my poem, each line represents the erosion of a core legal structure. *Marbury* stands for the ultimate collapse, not of a specific case, but of the Court‚Äôs authority itself, which has been lost through the systematic undermining of precedent. Anyone who has taken a semester of Constitutional Law should recognize the progression I intended. I don‚Äôt believe your claims of confusion are made in good faith.  Turning to your suggestion about replacing the cases: the poem is not a blanket criticism of every instance where precedent is overturned. Some reversals, like *Brown* and *Lawrence*, corrected deep constitutional failures. They did so with care and humility, respecting the body of precedent as a whole. More importantly, the cases they overturned‚Äî*Plessy* and *Bowers*‚Äîwere clearly at odds with the Bill of Rights. No serious person today argues that they should still be good law. These decisions expanded judicial credibility by demonstrating that the judiciary can recognize when the Constitution requires a different result than what previous social norms (not the Constitution) dictated.  In contrast, *Roe* and *Chevron* were not fringe doctrines or outliers. They served as structural pillars of both 14th Amendment jurisprudence and administrative law for decades. *Roe* and its progeny defined the contours of 14th Amendment jurisprudence for half a century, while *Chevron* organized administrative law for forty years. Lawyers and judges were trained to reason within those frameworks, and the Supreme Court repeatedly affirmed them across generations. If *Chevron* was truly ‚Äúalready-farcical,‚Äù as you claim (an assertion that reveals your agenda, by the way), then that makes fools of not only numerous Justices and hundreds of lower court judges who cited those cases, but nearly every administrative law scholar and practitioner for four+ decades. And if all those people were wrong, who is to say the current Court is not also mistaken? Or, for that matter, Chief Justice Marshall in *Marbury*?  The overruling of *Roe* and *Chevron* was not about correcting doctrinal error; it was about executing a long-standing ideological objective. These were not legal evolutions but rather the culmination of years of ideological signaling, culminating in a final, formal dismantling once the votes were secured. However, the Court's power does not come from votes; it comes from credibility, trust, and predictability, which both *Dobbs* and *Loper Bright* improvidently cashed in.  You called the inclusion of *Chevron* ‚Äúmaximally ironic.‚Äù  That missed the entire point.  The poem is not about who gains power; it is about how the Court *loses* it. And it‚Äôs surprising that someone as sharp as you didn‚Äôt grasp it.  Or, perhaps, you did, and simply chose not to argue in good faith.",emjaycue,2025-04-22T18:55:20,1

"I don‚Äôt know what to say, because they did order him back. The articles I sent you said so. You‚Äôre either not reading them or you‚Äôre choosing to ignore that fact to support your own argument.  I will quote Reuters for you: ‚ÄúUS Supreme Court tells Trump administration to facilitate return of Salvadoran man deported in error‚Äù - This is the exact title   Here are some exact statements in the article:  - ‚ÄúThe court, in an unsigned decision, said that the judge's order ""properly requires the government to 'facilitate' Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.""‚Äù  - ‚ÄúWhile siding with Abrego Garcia, the court directed Xinis to clarify the directive's requirement to ""effectuate"" his return ""with due regard for the deference owed to the executive branch in the conduct of foreign affairs.""‚Äù  Also, where are the articles I asked for? I‚Äôd love to see this evidence of involvement with MS-13.",Born-Use4982,2025-04-22T18:36:59,1
"I believe the article from the BBC more so than the Trump admin, yes. They linked Kristi Noems filing as reference, not validation. He was never convicted of being in a gang or a gang member.

"Key word being ""facilitate"". Which legally means something different than ORDERING you to do something. IOW it means removing domestic barriers for his return. Again, he is in custody of el salvador and he is a national of el salvador.",irteris,2025-04-22T18:39:57,0

In other words, you are ‚Äúmisrepresenting the opponents argument to make the argument easier to attack.‚Äù I am arguing and have been arguing this whole time that the Supreme Court ordered he be brought back to the US, by doing whatever they have to do with the government of El Salvador to make that happen. You know that, I know that.  I‚Äôd love to see evidence to your own claims about him being a member of MS-13, the tattoos, etc. when I‚Äôve shown you articles and opened myself up to see yours.

"JD Vance was the 1st person to say KAG was a convicted gang member, which wasn‚Äôt true.  He appeared to be referring to two denials of bond requests in which immigration courts used ALLEGATIONS that Abrego-Garcia was in a gang as a reason for their denial. Abrego-Garcia‚Äôs team denies that he‚Äôs a gang member and ‚Äî he has never been put on trial for or convicted of criminal charges. Kristi Noem ran with this in her response to Judge Xinis along with a bunch of other falsehoods. Judge Xinis read their discovery and got pissed because they were weak and making stuff up. She was NOT happy. Keep in mind, this all came from the guy who started the rumor that migrants were eating cats and dogs.   So read the discovery from DHS and then read Judge Xinis‚Äô response. And this attempt at implementing the Alien Enemies Act (because we are at war with El Salvador, who are using MS-13 as their military to InVaDe the US /s) is another half baked idea that will be shot down by the courts soon enough.  Here‚Äôs what gives me hope‚Ä¶Trump may have presidential immunity for official acts while in office, his cabinet and his enablers do not. We‚Äôll survive this. Because this admin and their followers are not serious people and they are not that smart. Yes, they are going to try to cause even more suffering for marginalized folks who can‚Äôt defend themselves. Yes, the world will become less safe as a result of their ineptitude and thirst to capture the news cycle rather than govern. And yes, another Democratic president will be elected as a result and be tasked with cleaning up the mess and fixing the deficit once again. But this time, there has to be a reckoning in order for the US to attempt at reestablishing itself not as a world leader, but as a democracy that folks will want to do business with. Either that or the entire country will look like New York in the 70s.",BarracudaBig7010,2025-04-22T16:26:58,1
Do your own research. FWIW You could see a video of Kilmar saying he is in fact a MS-13 member and you'll still find a way to make excuses for him. This is the hero ya'll have chosen. Good luck with that!,irteris,2025-04-22T19:49:36,1
"This is a very rude response to a completely reasonable request. I have admitted before in this sub I was incorrect and you were right, and have backtracked on the explanation on facts. I‚Äôve made it very clear based on the receipts that I do in fact do research, and that I will in fact admit that I‚Äôm wrong if given evidence that I am.  I am requesting the bare minimum that a court of law would ask for: actual evidence to support your claim. If you don‚Äôt want to supply that, and refuse to supply it but instead reply with logical fallacies or insults, then that tells me you don‚Äôt want an open dialogue. It tells me you want to be right at all costs, regardless of logic or facts. In an academic setting, a court of law, or even a basic business meeting, this wouldn‚Äôt fly.
