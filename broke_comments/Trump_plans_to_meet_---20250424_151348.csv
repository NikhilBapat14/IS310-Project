"That editor better make sure the meeting place is on the ground floor, with windows all over so everyone can see. Trump would love nothing more than to follow in Putin’s footsteps with eliminating opposition media.",Ancient_Popcorn,2025-04-24T15:15:51,1
"> ""I am doing this interview out of curiosity, and as a competition with myself, just to see if it's possible for The Atlantic to be 'truthful,'' Trump wrote.  Umm, this is obviously your typical horse shit comment by Trump.  I'm going to bet that there was an agreement that the interview be granted in exchange for the remainder of the Signal chat not be shared publicly.",HumanRuse,2025-04-24T15:38:48,1

"""He looked at me with tears in his eyes and said - 'Sir. I'm so, so, so very very sorry that I've been such a Trump hating, fake news journalist. You are by far the greatest president the country and the world has ever known. I can't live knowing I blasphemed you so.' and then he turned and just jumped out the window. Petey saw it, didn't you Pete? Yeah good boy.""",Taint_Liquor,2025-04-24T15:21:42,1
