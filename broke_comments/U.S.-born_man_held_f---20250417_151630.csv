His mother and a community advocate presented his birth certificate and Social Security card during a hearing in Leon County, but the judge said that she had no authority to release him due to the court’s jurisdiction.”  “He appears to have been arrested and charged under an “anti-immigration” law passed in Florida two months ago, despite the fact that the law is currently under a temporary restraining order and isn’t supposed to be enforced.”",Oceanbreeze871,2025-04-17T16:27:23,41
Who can oversee ICE behavior? Poor people can’t go to another court. Can’t pay for it. This lawless government behavior is about creating fear.  Fear of everything Trump might do. My hope is for a 2026 win in the house and a landslide in the Senate. To let Hakeem Jeffries impeach all the Trump team followed by a Nuremberg type senate trial. Including VP Vance.  President Hakeem sounds pretty good right now.,ajmampm99,2025-04-17T16:14:12,22
