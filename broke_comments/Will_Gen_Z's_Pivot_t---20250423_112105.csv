There's always been propaganda vomited on the news. Every generation has had to deal with it. Hell gen Z has access to more data than anyone. Plus the next reddit headline will say Gen Z is massively liberal. The people of this country need to take some responsibility and actually understand what they are voting for....and take the consequences.,danielsingleton77,2025-04-23T11:32:31,4

"The truth is, Gen Z doesn't believe in neither of the parties. I think what Trump does in these few years would scared them away from GOP, but just sitting here doing nothing without a real leader emerging won't have the Gen Z back",nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-04-23T11:45:24,0
"I think many young voters were angry about Joe Biden's policy regarding Gaza, so they backed trump this time in retaliation (VP Harris unfortunately got caught in the middle).  However, I'm reluctant to believe that they knowingly endorse trump's positions on women's reproductive rights, tariffs, voting rights and his other ultra right-wing policy stances.",kh-38,2025-04-23T12:03:03,-1
"And to be [more specific ](https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/overall-youth-turnout-down-2020-strong-battleground-states), only ~42% of people 18-29 voted in 2024. The oligarchs probably depressed the Gen Z vote (especially with Gen Z men) by social media election interference from Musk and similar by flooding it with right-wing propaganda driving out  the gamergate types and astroturf funded left-wing influencers to tell people their vote didn't matter or manipulating their understandable disgust at the U.S.-backed genocide in Gaza and telling them that Harris was going to send them to fight wars in Gaza or the middle east (while pretending Trump wouldn't).",RocketSocket765,2025-04-23T11:58:20,5

">What happens when American teenagers get stuck at home, prevented from experiencing the coming-of-age social milestones that most adults took for granted? They become Republicans, apparently.  Both YouTube and Meta properties were being mass targeting for political propaganda in that era...  It really is that ""Who is responsible for misinformation"" thing.

"People also don't consider that Gen Z works significantly more than any other generation. People I know that are also Gen Z were not able to get off work, With bills and rent so astronomically high, people are pulling double shifts on voting day. Furthermore, many of the polling places had massive lines because there are not enough for communities.",T0rtillaBurglar,2025-04-23T12:38:51,1
"They do look up things on their own, and the algorithms deliberately lead them astray. All the knowledge of history is buried under ten times its weight in misinformation. This is by design.

"Yeah, actually. I'm pretty good at investing as it happens, and being utterly cynical about Trump gives me a pretty clear idea of how to do it.  And generally speaking I know Republicans will keep cutting taxes as long as dumb voters keep them in office",FF3,2025-04-23T14:20:48,-1
Open youtube in incognito mode and look at the suggestions. It's bad and parents should not be letting their kids be preyed upon by these people.,Bloodyfish,2025-04-23T11:28:11,3
"And TikTok.  There was a study that I wish I could find the link to, which discovered that conservative voices on TikTok were being artificially amplified to their users.  If I remember correctly, for young users, every time they interacted with one piece of content on the platform that was positive towards Harris, they would be served up two pieces of content that were pro-Trump or anti-Harris.  The more pro-Harris content they watched the more dominant the negative message would become.",code_archeologist,2025-04-23T11:31:19,4

"Okay you did just something that you need to learn to stop doing.  That's a ""cute and tidy narrative."" The people who work at those companies know what is an isn't acceptable. They just simple refuse to do their jobs. You critically need to stop allowing companies to just ""push their responsibility"" away. It's their own product... They are responsible for it.  You got tricked by somebody in the media, so one more time: **It's their product, they are responsible.**  So no, the parents who are ""bad parents"" do not somehow become responsible over something they never had any control over. That's absurd... Those are bad companies making up excuses about their bad products...  Why is a company like Meta creating a situation where parents can become ""bad parents"" for simply allowing their children to use Meta's products? What?  We must critically stop engaging in this type of clownery. Obviously the owner is responsible for their property... They've turned their responsibility into a liability shield.",Actual__Wizard,2025-04-23T11:33:46,-4
"I posted a Reddit comment, not a published work. Gen Z is dealing with stagnant wages, even falling wages in the tech sector. Yet, despite this, productivity is double what it was 50 years ago.",T0rtillaBurglar,2025-04-23T13:33:17,0
I guess parents should also let their kids smoke because it's the tobacco company's job to stop them. Parents should still be looking out for their children's welfare even if it's to protect them from outside wrongdoing. This isn't some case where they have zero responsibility and should ignore their children being radicalized.,Bloodyfish,2025-04-23T11:45:59,3
So you have no actual evidence that Gen Z works significantly more than other generations.,nrith,2025-04-23T14:17:40,1
">I guess parents should also let their kids smoke because it's the tobacco company's job to stop them.  See, I knew you were going to play this ultra dumb game with me.  Tobacco products are illegal to sell to children for a very good reason.  So, you thought that you were trying to say something intelligent, but you actually proved my point.  You're absolutely correct, the average person is such a bad parent, that if we didn't make smoking for children totally illegal, there would be parents that would teach their kids to smoke. That's why it's illegal.  That's exactly what we're going to do to Meta as well.  Because the only reason that you even think that for a single second is because some company like Meta tricked you with their evil lies. Obviously Meta is responsible for their product... *Obviously...* To even think for a single second that they are not responsible for their own product is totally absurd...  Obviously we knew a tidal wave of misinformation was coming when SCOTUS made their moves.   Yeah that's great, they're creating a safe space for propaganda and then shoving it into your kids faces, while they tell you that only bad parents let their kids on Facebook. People like you can't figure it out either.",Actual__Wizard,2025-04-23T11:48:23,-2
"I will say, if this is what you choose to argue about, rather than actually finding solutions for issues that younger generations face, that tells me your priorities are misguided. We need higher wages, we need to make election day a national holiday, more polling places. My argument is to make voting easier and wages higher.",T0rtillaBurglar,2025-04-23T15:12:52,0
What twisted world do you live in where you think parents should do nothing to keep their kids safe because it's someone else's responsibility?,Bloodyfish,2025-04-23T11:50:41,3
"Bro, it can be a ""both are responsible but Meta is more/mostly responsible"".  Parents absolutely should bear the responsibility for aspects of their kid's development.  Just as you're browbeating this dude for letting corporations off the hook, people like you are providing way too much cover for absolute shit parents.",BonesIIX,2025-04-23T12:01:27,3
"As an outside observer on this exchange, it feels like you aren't making as great of an effort to understand as they are making an effort to explain it to you. Either lazy, or bad faith participation. ",chicol1090,2025-04-23T11:53:12,0
">What twisted world do you live in where you think parents should do nothing to keep their kids safe because it's someone else's responsibility?   That is not even close to what I said.  Everybody has a responsibility. Okay. Any time some organization has some legal glitch to have no responsibility, that critically has to be addressed. That's absurd... So, Meta is a pipeline for terrorists and criminals to recruit children straight from your home?  And then you don't care because you blame the parents and there's absolutely nothing we can do legally to stop it?  You do realize how incredible vile and evil Mark Zuckerberg is for engaging in this type of behavior correct? I mean how much more evil can a person be?  Obviously there's an extremely good reason that the DOJ feels that they're forced to break Meta up.",Actual__Wizard,2025-04-23T11:58:17,-2
Neat and tidy narratives indeed.,Psephological,2025-04-23T12:24:43,1
"Oh please, the entire explanation is some strawman where they insist that because I think people should be more mindful of their kids viewing habits and protect them from outside groups with bad intentions then I must not care about the negative influences themselves that we have zero control over. Parents need to protect their kids from propaganda just as much as they have to protect them from other stupid pitfalls. You still have to child proof your house instead of getting angry that electrical sockets and cleaning products are dangerous.",Bloodyfish,2025-04-23T11:58:02,2
"Yeah, unless you think you can reddit post Meta into changing tactics, I think people should be involved in their kid's lives and keeping them safe. Assuming that means I support Meta or think nothing should be done is ridiculous, but I definitely don't support wringing your hands and tossing your kids into the deep end.",Bloodyfish,2025-04-23T12:02:20,1

">I think people should be involved in their kid's lives and keeping them safe.  I agree. So we're going to end this conversation now? No, social media companies are not devoid of responsibility because some anonymouys person posted the propaganda on their spam account? Did you figure it out yet?   So user NotMarkZuckberg posts their political propaganda and then shoves it into your kids face is not magically okay it was user ""NotMarkZuckerberg"" and not Meta?

"What exactly are you advocating for?   * Outright ban on Social media * Termination of safe harbor laws * Legally enforced age verification  Part of the problem - from a legal sense is that all of those options, while well intentioned, will stifle freedom of information and content sharing in ways that have very ominous overtones.  Until you can propose a solution that somehow threads the needle of curbing extremism without providing a tool for the extremists to silence opposition themselves, it's kinda on the parents in the immediate future to help guide their children safely though the wild west that is the internet.",BonesIIX,2025-04-23T12:14:24,2
