"Is gotten to the point that anyone that has any type of flag, “patriot” quote, or the like on their car is the complete opposite of what they think they mean.  They also don’t understand that you can love your country but also question your government.",GonePhishingAgain,2025-04-17T13:11:32,60

"They also don't understand that during the Founding Era, Americans believed that civic duty was equally as important as personal liberties, and it's a man's civic duty to defend his town against a riot, insurrection, or an attack from redcoats or Indians. In most cases, ""The People"" back then meant the people of towns, cities, or states together as a collective. It was a man's civic duty to protect his community, as well as pay taxes, attend town meetings, and write to elected officials. These were seen as prioritizing the greater good over personal gain and greed.",x_xHaunter313,2025-04-17T13:15:20,8
