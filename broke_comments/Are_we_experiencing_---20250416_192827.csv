"https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/umberto-eco-ur-fascism  Irrationalism also depends on the cult of action for action’s sake. Action being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation. Therefore culture is suspect insofar as it is identified with critical attitudes. Distrust of the intellectual world has always been a symptom of Ur-Fascism, from Goering’s alleged statement (“When I hear talk of culture I reach for my gun”) to the frequent use of such expressions as “degenerate intellectuals,” “eggheads,” “effete snobs,” “universities are a nest of reds.” The official Fascist intellectuals were mainly engaged in attacking modern culture and the liberal intelligentsia for having betrayed traditional values.  No syncretistic faith can withstand analytical criticism. The critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge. For Ur-Fascism, disagreement is treason.  Besides, disagreement is a sign of diversity. Ur-Fascism grows up and seeks for consensus by exploiting and exacerbating the natural fear of difference. The first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.  Ur-Fascism derives from individual or social frustration. That is why one of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups. In our time, when the old “proletarians” are becoming petty bourgeois (and the lumpen are largely excluded from the political scene), the fascism of tomorrow will find its audience in this new majority.",meerkatx,2025-04-17T01:24:44,8

This happened a while ago. 1987 to be exact. When the FCC dissolved the Fairness Doctrine media took it upon itself to focus on platforms that the different viewer bases were then able focus on. This lack of questioning what they knew caused them to accept what amounts to a type of propaganda. Not challenging one's views has enabled an individual intellectual complacency that has grown more and more.  The only change has been that the internet initially wasn't biased because targeting algorithms weren't as refined as they are now.

"This is a bad question based on a false assumption. The two parties have never been ideologically consistent. They are ""big tent,"" pluralistic parties that build alliances among constituencies that have contradictory views and interests. Up until the 70s, the Democratic party included New Deal progressives and segregationist southern Democrats. Since the 70s, the Republicans have depended on an uncomfortable alliance between free marketeers and evangelical Christians. You could point out these contradictions endlessly from any point in American history.   What has changed in the last ten years on the Republican side is the way that a functional unity is created. Previously most intraparty contradictions were smoothed over through compromise and tolerance, with some strong-arm compulsion behind the scenes (or they weren't, resulting in bust-ups like the Democrats in 68). Trump's Republican party has shifted almost entirely to compulsion as members who disagree with the Party Leader are either driven out or cowed into silence. Ironically, I think in some ways the Republican party is currently more ""ideologically"" consistent than at any point in history. The difference is that the ""ideology"" is not based on ideas or reason. It is solely based on obeisance to a Fuhrerprinzip and on a joy in performative cruelty. It still looks contradictory though because the Leader himself lacks coherent thoughts or sustained attention, and he lets the creatures he sets in power a step below him often run their own projects pretty much as they see fit as long as they perform the requisite obeisance and cruelty.",NoAttitude1000,2025-04-17T13:56:39,1

Take the GOP supporting Trump’s move to pull funding from private universities and push for audits of student political beliefs. If Biden or Obama had proposed that exact same thing, the right would be screaming “tyranny” and “state overreach.” But when it’s Trump, they justify it as “accountability.”  Flip it: Democrats rail against insider trading, Musk’s influence, and oligarchy when Trump’s connected — but where was that energy when Pelosi was raking in market returns better than hedge funds? Or when Biden huddles with Silicon Valley donors? Silence. Suddenly it’s not a threat to democracy.  This isn’t about values anymore — it’s about teams. If “my side” does it, it's fine. If “your side” does it, it’s the end of America. That kind of blind tribalism is how democracies rot from the inside.  And let’s be honest — a big part of it is that Trump broke the unspoken rules of the political class. He didn’t play their game, so a lot of people — including the media — convinced themselves that breaking their own rules to stop him was justified. That’s not defending democracy. That’s just hypocrisy with better PR.  You can’t scream about overreach, corruption, or fascism when it’s politically convenient — and then look the other way when your side does the same thing. If you actually care about principles, they have to apply no matter who’s in office.  The real danger isn’t Trump or Biden — it’s that we’re training an entire population to only care about the rules when it hurts the other team. That’s how you lose the thread completely.

You say we've lost a sense of ""values"" and ""principles,"" but then throw yourself into utterly valueless relativism that says there's no difference between what Trump is doing and what any other politician has done. For example, there is a vast difference between what Trump is allowing Musk to do and Biden ""huddling"" with Silicon Valley donors. Politicians of both parties have always met with business leaders, and they've always taken donations from them. It's how America has always worked. The business of America is business.

Trump didn't break the ""unspoken rules of the political class"". He's broken the norms and spirit of the law that have sustained American democracy since the founding, and increasingly he's breaking the letter of the law as well.

">First Trump term huge successes on foreign policy.  What successes are those? As a foreigner, Trump's last tenure was exceptionally bad for US foreign politics. It's what initially started the whole decoupling of EU from US and is why the EU has had their own plans for internet infrastructure (among other things) since 2016.  As a European, from my perspective, Trump made all of EU start to prepare for an EU without US, but hoping they wouldn't have to go that far (look at military expenditure as examples of this). US lost a lot of soft power and is no longer seen as a reliable partner; this all started under Trump's first tenure.  Not to mention that the general populace all make fun of both Trump and US because of Trump. Even extremist right-wing voters in many countries in EU make a clear point of distancing themselves from Trump and Trump politics.  So what metric are you using when you say that Trump had huge success? Because to me, Trump's first tenure started off a historical shift where US started losing its dominant leading position of the free world. Trump saw less money being spent but didn't realize that the US spent this money for EU to maintain power projection across all of EU and maintain US supremacy through bargaining and protectionism/patronage; Trump threw all of this away because he thinks EU spends too little money. The result now? EU is going to start up their own military market, and US will lose out both on a ton of money and soft power as a result. This is a loss/loss situation, but the biggest loser will be the US. The US has already lost considerable bargaining power in EU and elsewhere. As an example, US treasury bonds are dropping in price and US dollar is losing value; other countries and investors don't trust the US anymore to maintain their dominance and safe haven. I would describe these developments - starting from his first tenure - as extremely bad for US, and nowhere near anything that could be called ""success"". So I am very curious what makes you feel that Trump had ""foreign success"" during his first tenure, when the consensus among foreigners is that Trump more or less is the \*worst\* US president, period, to ever hold office?",upfastcurier,2025-04-17T01:56:39,12

I'm more concerned about market manipulation - dumping stock the day before announcing tariffs on everybody, for instance, or buying the night before announcing that they're all paused except for China. That's all behavior that requires advanced knowledge of what the government will do and actually making trades based on that information. Same for the ones who dumped their portfolios after Congress had been briefed on COVID but before any major press or lockdowns were happening.  I do agree that Congress should be considered insiders and there should be blackout periods around things, but not a general ban on trading. For instance ""no trading in a stock from the moment it's announced that their executives are invited to testify until 3 days after that testimony becomes public"". I might also suggest that reporting trades be done in advance rather than after the fact. ""I will be buying TSLA tomorrow"" is better than ""45 days ago, I bought TSLA"".

"This seems like a prime example of my point, and possibly the related point that people do sometimes change their views/recognize they were wrong about something.  ------  Gary Gensler's a good example. You are right - he had some role in the CFMA of 2000, although it's hard to find all that clear of an explanation of what since he wasn't directly in charge.  However, for the past 25 years since - he's transformed into one of those most aggressively pushing for tighter regulations + oversight. Many of the areas we've toughened regulations + enforcement have involved him.  Sarbanes-Oxley (2002), Dodd-Frank (2010) + the much stricter oversight at CFTC in his tenure, and pretty much everything he did while running the SEC under Biden - especially with regards to trying to bring crypto under more oversight, are all pretty much the exact opposite of deregulation.",SkiingAway,2025-04-17T15:34:38,1

"I would draw a distinction here between elected congressional Democrats and the Democratic voter base. They are different groups that believe different things, and tension between those groups is part of why the left is such a mess right now.  The Democratic voter base is staunchly against insider trading and is more than happy to hold their own politicians to account - there have been numerous examples of politicians who have had to resign in disgrace after committing misconduct that goes against what the voter base stands for.  Congressional democrats are divided, with some strongly against insider trading and some in favor because it benefits them personally. The democrats in favor of it are most disconnected from their voters and aren’t able to represent what the voters want. Emblematic of this - Chuck Schumer, who has like a 27% approval rating (last I checked) among Democrats, which is horrifically low for the minority leader.   Some (not all) congressional democrats are absolutely hypocrites. The ones that are, are almost universally hated, and the party wants them removed. Unfortunately, despite how hated they are, the opposition party is somehow 10 million times worse, so the hypocrites keep getting elected and even supported publicly in an effort to stop the rise of fascism. Arguably, cutting out the hypocrisy root and stem would have helped us prevent that fascism earlier, but I don’t think many Democrats realized how deep that rot went within the leadership until after the 2024 election. For a clearer example - most democratic voters were deadly serious about the imminent threat Trump posed to our democracy and how much they wanted to resist it, but many in the leadership appeared to only be saying that in order to win elections, without actually believing it.

There is *not* 200 years of popular and official understanding of the 2A right as a collective right. The 2A right was understood as an *individual* right until Jim Crow. Go read the dicta in *Dred Scott* where Justice Taney listed ""the right to keep and carry arms"" right alongside holding political meetings and being able to travel freely without being harassed by police as one of the reasons that 'surely the Founders couldn't have intended black people to be citizens.' *Dred Scott* was an atrocious ruling and has been rightly repudiated, but that dicta shows us, in clear language, what the common understanding was in 1857.

(And refer back to the popular view of the ""whiteness"" of the Irish-American and Italian-American Chicagoland gangs of the time that were the real drivers of said crime. Again, racism plays a very ugly role in gun control history, even when laws are racially neutral on their face.)  Presumably this is the part where you say that's just a disagreement with the interpretation.

I hope to the gods that I don't really believe in that SCOTUS doesn't decide to listen to them. Because not all ""interpretations"" are reasonable, *especially* when they're just a veneer.",Corellian_Browncoat,2025-04-17T15:06:58,1
"It's not at all what the post is about. It appears that in your mind, every discussion about politics must devolve into Democrats vs Republicans. You claim to have concluded that because the main post contains the words ""GOP, Trump, Obama, Biden, democrats, universities, and Musk"", that the point was to defend one side and attack another?  I really can't keep explaining this to you, as I have many times. The discussion is about biases that many (yourself very strongly) have where they can only see the bad in their opposing side and only see the good in their own side. I guess if you want to know the point of my post it was to illustrate logical errors resulting in contradictions and black-and-white ""team sport"" politics that you yourself are currently committing.",Niceotropic,2025-04-17T03:23:56,0

"And off you go, as expected. If uneven and racist enforcement of the law irrevocably taints support for it, we'd have to oppose laws against rape too. I don't find that a convincing argument for the simple fact that racism taints *all* historical laws in the US to one degree or an other. Gun control laws well pre-date the 14th Amendment: the first ones date back to the 1810's. It's not quite the same thing as Trump's take on birthright citizenship. If it were valid, then It would effectively grant all illegal immigrants diplomatic immunity: his order hinges on illegal immigrants not being subject to the jurisdiction of the US which would mean, amongst other things, that there would be no legal recourse for murder other than deportation. It's implausible on the face of the reading because of the inherent contradictions.",VodkaBeatsCube,2025-04-17T15:41:13,2
"I really wish you would explain.  I'm trying to argue that it's not a bias. It's an informed judgement.  Please highlight the good in Republicans, because i can't seem to find any.  I am being intellectually consistent.  Republicans are consistently deserving of criticism.  Have you seen the town halls of 100s of republicans booing republican leaders?  That's the point we're at.  Even the silent majority republicans ate disgusted.  Only MAGA is left supporting Trump.  Do you want consistency or complacency? You can't meet someone in the middle who is ignoring due process.",DjangoBojangles,2025-04-17T03:34:27,9
">The discussion is about biases that many (yourself very strongly) have where they can only see the bad in their opposing side and only see the good in their own side.  Your seem to be saying ""they're highlighting their own party's consistency more than the other party's, therefore they're biased towards their own party"".   Hypothetically, suppose that Party X is objectively better (i.e. less inconsistent) than Party Y.  In this hypothetical, how would you tell that Party X is better? An advocate of Party X will say ""look at examples ABC where they did better"", and you would conclude that ""this advocate of Party X is biased toward Party X"", not ""Party X is better"".  If you *don't* have a method of telling whether one party is better, then the worse party is incentivized to be as bad (i.e. hypocritical) as possible for their own gain, since they'll never take any blame for it since nobody can tell which party is better.",Serious_Feedback,2025-04-17T08:53:15,6
"Yes, that’s a lone case in a sea of cases that characterized it individual. Again, this thinking didn’t take hold until the 1900s. We even had Dred Scott and Cruikshank from the Supreme Court characterizing it as an individual right.   Even Miller only worked in an individual rights framework. The turning point in our jurisprudence was really Cases v. Tot in 1942, which overruled Miller from below to do it, but it took until Stevens in 1971 for the theory to be solidified, and named in 1976 in Warin. All the circuit cases mention Miller, but they’re really going off of the repudiation of Miller in Cases.",DBDude,2025-04-17T18:58:34,1
">  If uneven and racist enforcement of the law irrevocably taints support for it, we'd have to oppose laws against rape too.  I mean, if we ignore that rape in itself is a violent crime, and that laws against rape weren't passed with the express intent of racial discrimination and oppression, sure I guess you could make the same argument against rape. I personally think you're well beyond reasonable on that comparison, though.  But the conversation has run its course at this point. Have a good day.",Corellian_Browncoat,2025-04-18T10:05:51,1
"We know for a fact that not all gun control laws are backdoor attempts to restrict black people's ownership of guns because they predate the 14th Amendment. If Kentucky in 1813 wanted to ban black people having guns, they could just draft a law banning black people carrying guns. Support of gun control is rooted in a desire to not have to live with the lingering spectre of random gun violence anywhere you happen to be, not because 'they hate guns'. But, as I knew at the start of this, you're dogmatically convinced your position is righteous and all potential disagreement is rooted in at best ignorance and more generally a deep and abiding hatred of your values rather than an actual honest difference in values and opinions. So you go out and find anything that you can use to gird your position in righteousness and reduce any opposition to an implicit endorsement of the worst values of American history, and never bother to consider that, like most things in the world, history and policy can't be easily condensed down into a simple black and white worldview where one side is pure and righteous and the other ignorant and evil.",VodkaBeatsCube,2025-04-18T10:24:00,3
