Fox had to pay millions of dollars for lying to their viewers. Don't post this garbage.,Phynx88,2025-04-24T09:08:12,15
"Sounds good to me! EU regulations have done a world of good for consumers.   \- Do you like not having 50 different types of chargers? Thank EU regulations!  \- Do you like having the ability to turn off cookies? Thank EU regulations!  There's a lot of good that can come from this, so I say keep up the good work!",Prudent-Blueberry660,2025-04-24T10:30:05,5
"Ye, well, what - you thought we in EU will kneel to Trump bullying? Fuck you, we can trade war too. While we still have nice trades with rest of the world. US is just one nation. Wanna go to war with everyone else - good luck. Buckle up.",Sol0botmate,2025-04-24T10:18:58,3

Didn't California just burn down all of their forests?    They didn't even do it to generate energy. They just let it happen.,ClassOptimal7655,2025-04-24T09:10:50,-6
> Didn't California just burn down all of their forests?   No.   Stop believing GOP nonsense. It's not a good look for you.,Cat_herder_81,2025-04-24T09:23:38,2
That's natural here.,CRTsdidnothingwrong,2025-04-24T09:14:06,-3
GOP nonsense?    Canada and several other countries sent help to California to help put out their fires which burned for weeks...  Why are you pretending that didn't happen?,ClassOptimal7655,2025-04-24T09:26:15,-9
It's natural for your state to avoid any fire prevention and allow entire communities to burn to the ground?    Yikes...,ClassOptimal7655,2025-04-24T09:14:53,-6
"> GOP nonsense?   Yes, GOP nonsense. Those were 2 little words; I don't know why they give you such trouble.   >Canada and several other countries sent help to California to help put out their fires which burned for weeks...  Forest fires California has every year =/= burning all their forests to the ground.   The former is a routine occurrence; the latter is bullshit spewed by Trump and his ilk to try and make California look bad.",Cat_herder_81,2025-04-24T09:33:00,3
Controlled burns are a natural thing that have been used for centuries to clear forest debris.  You'd know that if you didn't insist on defunding the education department that helps fund the history books you refuse to read.,ERedfieldh,2025-04-24T11:59:08,1
