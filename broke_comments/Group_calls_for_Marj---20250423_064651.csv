Old school KKK was anti-Catholic.   If Trump and his GOP lickspittles don't condemn her then they should be relentlessly painted as anti-Catholic.   We need to learn how to message and not tire of repetition. Republicans are good at that and it helped them get a trifecta.,clamorous_owle,2025-04-23T09:17:21,86

Did I read she's actually running against Ossof? Oh my God I hope so! I voted for him the first time and heading back to Georgia this summer. He will absolutely destroy her. She is going to make Herschel Walker look like a rocket scientist,MidnightNo1766,2025-04-23T09:59:54,25

"MTG is a disgusting pos who I genuinely hate.  However I totally disagree with Donohue saying that ‚Äúno sitting member of Congress has the right to denigrate the leader of a world religion.‚Äù  They absolutely have that right regardless if they are denigrating the pope, the dali lama, an ayatollah, Jerry Falwell, Franklin Graham, Joel Osteen, or any other leader of a church regardless how large or small it might be.  We all have that right.    Just leave The Righteous Gemstones out of your god damned mouth.",VanDenBroeck,2025-04-23T08:37:08,16

We have a tyrannical administration defying court orders and dismantling our government.

"They consider civil rights like a pie, if more rights are given to others then they feel their rights are being taken away.   Couple that with a persecution complex, and a religion where one of the core tenants is to separate themselves (the believers) into a group going to a good place and others (the non believers) into a group going to a bad place, along with a healthy dose of sexual repression and a sprinkling of the idea trickle down economics works and you get the modern republican.",annaleigh13,2025-04-23T08:50:59,8

"That's irrelevant because the overwhelming majority of Republican House members who won in 2024 by margins of 9% or less are outside the South. Of the 21, 20 are elsewhere.

"Those states you mention do not have nearly as many members in the house of representatives. The majority of the development and population in the US is on the east coast, and the red states on the east coast are Baptist. The Catholics on the east coast are Democrat, and the Republicans aren't going to side with the Democrats.   I'm just being realistic about it. It's not likely anything gets done, because the south would need to make the first move and they won't.",imnota4,2025-04-23T10:51:30,-1
"A\] Those are Congressional districts - not states.  B\] Your information about Catholics is just wrong. Staten Island, 76.9% Catholic, makes up the bulk of NY-11 which is represented by Republican Nicole Malliotakis who got 64.49% of the vote in 2024. The GOP margin in NY-11 was too big to make the list I posted.  If i had tons more time I could provide information for most of those districts.  In districts won by narrow margins it doesn't take a lot of people to switch in order for it to flip.",clamorous_owle,2025-04-23T11:26:06,3
"Southern Republicans and Northern Republicans are not the same type of Republicans. Massachusetts had a Republican governor for a while, but he was more Democrat by southern standards.  Say you don't live in the North-East without saying it.",imnota4,2025-04-23T12:48:54,1
"I live in the Northeast. Long Island is another example of heavily Republican Catholic populations. Yes, I think historically NY Republicans were fiscally conservative and socially liberal, but that changed with Trump‚Äôs first term. Moms for Liberty run rampant here, and up until the last few weeks, MAGA flags were everywhere. I know multiple old family friends here that went down the QAnon rabbit hole. The internet is erasing a lot of those regional distinctions. I know that not all Catholics are Republicans (I grew up in a center-left Catholic family), but many are.",jamesblakemc,2025-04-23T13:41:54,2
"Maybe, but I think that's going to correct itself pretty soon.  Genuinely I think a lot of Republicans just vote that way because they hate how pro-government the Democrats are, which is absolutely fair. Democrats are WAY too pro-government considering literally all of history shows that's not a good idea. But thanks to Trump's horrible policies and inability to run a country we're seeing a shift where Democrats are starting to realize that giving unlimited power to a centralized government body probably isn't the best idea, no matter how enticing the idea may seem.  Either Democrats will move to a new pro-civil rights, anti-federalist party or the Democrats will make that shift themselves. Either way when it happens a lot of people that voted Republican will likely join them because the one thing about the Democrats they absolutely hated will disappear.  I could be wrong and completely misreading the situation. There's also the possibility everyone doubles down and things get far worse. I just like to be optimistic that people aren't that thick headed.",imnota4,2025-04-23T21:14:04,1
