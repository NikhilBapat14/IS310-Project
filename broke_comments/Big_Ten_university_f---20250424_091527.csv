"Unfortunately, if I were Washington state, I would be interested to see how the “swing state” college faculty and administration voted. Turns out a fair weather friend isn’t a friend at all. That’s a hard lesson to learn. I wouldn’t sign anything with the state of Nebraska period or Indiana or Iowa. Let’s see how outraged we really are? Or is it a faux outrage?",Conscious_Problem924,2025-04-24T10:34:38,1
