"Oklahoma, the state that wiped out an entire town of people bc of the color of their skin.  shame on you! Shame!  That hate  is ignorance, the same ignorance that supports a drug like alcohol over s healing herb that has never killed anyone.",anuiswatching,2025-04-22T09:46:32,1

"Wait why is this a bad thing? Marijuana can trigger schizophrenia and psychosis in people. It‚Äôs important for physicians to understand what goes on in their patients bodies. It‚Äôs not like physicians are reporting or arresting people for use. They just want to provide the best patient care.  Maybe I‚Äôm missing something about the actors involved?   Ps I‚Äôm pro marijuana use, just know that continuing education for doctors on substances used regularly by patients isn‚Äôt a bad thing.",beadzy,2025-04-22T10:44:37,2
"It‚Äôs wild how we‚Äôve normalized alcohol‚Äîliteral poison that‚Äôs linked to liver failure, domestic abuse, and thousands of deaths a year‚Äîbut marijuana? Suddenly it‚Äôs time for urgent ‚Äúcontinuing education‚Äù and concern over psychosis. Not saying weed is risk-free, but the double standard is exhausting. If doctors really want to understand what their patients are putting in their bodies, let‚Äôs start with the legal, celebrated substance that‚Äôs destroying way more lives than cannabis ever has. Just sayin‚Äô.",acr70,2025-04-22T11:12:14,4
I work with physicians and I can tell you not one of them normalizes alcohol use. Where are you getting your info?,beadzy,2025-04-22T11:13:16,2
If you think there is no physical impact of things you consume then there is no point discussing this further. We would be at an impasse,beadzy,2025-04-22T11:14:03,1
"I hear you‚Äînot claiming weed is harmless, and I‚Äôm not saying docs are out there handing out kegs of beer. But it‚Äôs insane that alcohol‚Äîliterally a top cause of liver disease, addiction, and social chaos‚Äîis sold on every corner (liquor stores deemed ‚Äúessential‚Äù mid‚Äëpandemic, no less), while cannabis users get lectures about psychosis. That special‚Äëtreatment blind spot for booze is pure hypocrisy. üåøüç∫",acr70,2025-04-22T11:21:12,1
