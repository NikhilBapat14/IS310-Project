"The whole ""protests don't change anything"" narrative is also very much a double edged sword for fascism, because their idea of strength is directly predicated on their ability to destroy their enemies. If lots of people protest, even if it doesn't directly change anything, then the government still loses out because nothing also happens to the protestors. Fascism's narrative of strength and unity depends on it doing away with those who dissent because it aspires to be a totalitarian movement. It has to destroy all dissent and dissenters. When you declare those who disagree to be enemies, you have to act on that. When that does not happen because it is not possible or not practical, they show that they are not in control, that they are weak even within their own narrative. Fascism faces similar problems abroad if and when it fails to deal with external enemies.",barryvm,2025-04-23T05:08:30,76
"Just a guess, but the “protests don’t work” propaganda means protests are working.   They are btw.   Momentum. Recruit people.   Taking it to the streets is the biggest weapon they people have.   Let’s use it.",shakergeek,2025-04-23T09:09:06,20
"Protest certainly seems to have worked to get rid of Elon Musk, they have bitten him where he feels it most, the value of his companies. ""Hey hey ho ho Elon Musk has got to go"", indeed.",foshi22le,2025-04-23T04:10:09,34
"**Summary**: Debates about recent protests swing between extremes: optimists cite the ""3.5% rule"" for regime change, while pessimists dismiss demonstrations as performative. Both views oversimplify—protests rarely spur immediate policy shifts but build morale and long-term power. Despite early defeatism, mass mobilizations have surged under Trump’s second term, fostering solidarity. Yet lasting impact depends on sustained organizing, not just turnout.",pharrt,2025-04-23T03:15:32,25

"I think the success will be tied to growing dissent.  To getting those who haven’t previously engaged to take up words and actions.  Too many sit silent waiting for others to do the work.  When we all become vocal, it’s MAGA that has to shut up and listen.",TiberiosRex,2025-04-23T06:57:17,5

"Even when protests don't have immediate direct effects, they have lots of indirect effects.    People who go to protests become more politically engaged.  Even people who honk their car horns in support as they drive past a protest feel a little more invested in politics.  There's something about physically going out and participating in a movement with other people than you just can't replicate by liking a social media post.  People who go to protests and rallies are more likely to vote, more likely to follow news, more likely to talk about politics with their friends and family, more likely to participate in strikes/boycotts/etc., and more likely to go to the next protest.",shinkouhyou,2025-04-23T11:07:42,4

"Protest only really work if they are big enough, and go on long enough. The friendly weekend daytime protest ain't gonna cut it. Prolonged, massive protests are definitely a move in the right direction, as far as moving the needle on actual real-world things in a situation such as the one that we are in.",bamboob,2025-04-23T13:38:08,2
"Protests absolutely have power. The Tesla boycott & dealership protests are a good recent example.  The empty & pointless Saturday rallies on the 5th & 19th, much less so.  And there’s the rub: protests have to *have a fucking point*, not just be an outlet. We apparently learned nothing from Occupy Wallstreet (or incorrectly think it was a success when it was probably the greatest failure of the last 20 years in terms of protests… tho the BLM protests have to be up there too).  Direct & targeted protest *works*. Going on a long walk to blow off steam & pretend you did something… doesn’t. And we’ve mostly done the latter over the last 25 years.",abritinthebay,2025-04-23T09:31:58,2
"Activism has to be multifaceted to be successful. Not everyone is a walker, and walking is beneficial for awareness…but then what?   Organizers, builders, outreach, problem solvers are all important.  If we look at Occupy Wall Street the movement was incredibly successful at first but it failed to convert to anything other than walking and occupying. The Tea Party movement wasn’t as successful at first with the optics of walking but they managed to continue gathering and converting to something other than walking. Unfortunately that success led us to MAGA.   I say these things not to criticize protesting and rallying. It is one very useful tool of many. But we also need to consider this isn’t 1965 any longer, what are some new tools? Where does a movement go when the rally is done?",GivMHellVetica,2025-04-23T12:14:38,1

"Protests do work, but these weekend protests do nothing. We need protests during work days, disrupting the economy. A peaceful weekend protests is easily ignorable and outright encouraged by the right. It gives the left an opportunity to vent frustration",OmegaKitty1,2025-04-23T07:18:04,1

"Which protests in the last 20 years did anything?  Occupy? BLM? Trump's first term? Trump's second term? Jan 6? Palestine?  There were zero policy shifts from any of these. I don't know how anyone can look at these and think any progress was made or change enacted by protesting. I'm not saying limited progress or weak progress. It's zero progress. Not a single law or policy was enacted at the federal level. There was some (limited) progress in already progressive state governments on some of these, but again it was very weak.  You're better off boycotting and organizing for a general strike.",Corosis99,2025-04-23T08:47:04,-4

"This is why protests need to actively escalate. One of the biggest problems I see first hand in the US is that people disparage any attempts to do so. Just this past weekend I was at a protest where the crowd started chanting, “Fuck Trump” and they were asked by the organizers to “keep it peaceful.” Americans have a very warped idea of what kind of public demonstrations should be socially acceptable.  This is why it is so important for the “protests do nothing” crowd to get off their asses and participate. If you want to apply more pressure, it starts by you showing up and encouraging people to do more.  Protests aren’t a magic revolution bullet. They are a networking opportunity for revolutionaries.",kieranjackwilson,2025-04-23T16:02:09,4

"Exactly. Critics are correct when they say that a single protest on a Saturday doesn’t necessarily move the needle just because you have a very large crowd. But I think they miss the point that the large crowd is more of an advertisement than an attempt to actually change policy. I see examples of sustained effort going on all around me in my local area, and there seems to be indication that it’s happening in other areas too. I’m very sure that many of these people who are now advocating and organizing would not have felt comfortable to do so if they did not see other public support. It feeds on itself.  Also, frankly, my opinion at this point is that even if it doesn’t work, who cares? What is your alternative strategy? That we just roll over and give up? I would rather stand for something and not win then stand for nothing and still lose it all.",Material-Surprise-72,2025-04-23T11:59:46,3
"It's performative, at least here in Eugene and Portland, Oregon, two of the most liberal cities in the US. The congressional reps are already on our (the Dems) side, and the same goes for the senators.  People need to get out and vote, and I suppose, demonstrate in the months leading up to the primaries. MAGA voters and Trump don't care about these protests. Trump isn't going to get impeached by a Republican House and Senate in a billion years. Zero chance. Republicans only watch Fox News. Solidarity is nice and dandy, but the primaries are the most important thing in *districts where seats need to be flipped*.",dschinghiskhan,2025-04-23T04:04:32,-2

He is filthy rich. He can hire enough lawyers to delay any legal  ramifications until the heat death of the universe  - if he doesn't just receive a presidential pardon. He will never be broke or in prison. All he does is provide a shiny thing to feel good protesting and provide cover for Trump.
