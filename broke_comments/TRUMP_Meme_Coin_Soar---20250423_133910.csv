"It's really disturbing to see how normalized this seems, considering the price of the meme coin even reached $16.17 intraday, really, does anyone really think this is a good look, and what message are we sending when people get a White House tour just for holding a token? It's enough to make you wonder what's happening and how much worse things will get, honestly... it's just wild.",avid-learner-bot,2025-04-23T13:51:44,17

"Once again we see where Trump's priorities really lie.  Not with America or its 340 million citizens, but with his own enrichment.   He has smartly realized that occupying the White House can do wonders for your brand, opening up all kinds of new and highly lucrative revenue streams.  Forget MAGA. His personal four letter acronym is FAGA - Fuck America, Gain Affluence.",crazybones,2025-04-23T14:21:26,6

"I remember when the Lincoln Bedroom for contributors scandal hit Clinton in the 90s. It was a big deal at the time. (As an aside, Travelgate was also a huge ethics scandal which involved firing just 7 federal employees - the FBI, DOJ, GAO, and House Oversight Committee all investigated). Just bizarre how little the media seems to care about Trump's various shake downs and grifts. ",bureaucatnap,2025-04-23T14:12:13,8
