"This is weirdly relatable to me. I’ve made the same wrong turn, had a good laugh with the border officers, and went on my way.  Really sickening to see how dark things have become.",voigtster,2025-04-24T21:18:40,1

"I just want to point out that the NYT was first to report this story a few days ago, and at the time, the location of Ricardo Prada Vásquez was unknown. He had just disappeared. Because the NYT published that story, the Department of Homeland Security responded and revealed that he was sent to El Salvador. This is a great example of why the media needs to keep attention on these stories of people sent by the US to El Salvador.  DHS says Prada Vásquez is a member of Tren de Aragua. But like all the others, he didn't get due process so he could defend his innocence. There have been lots of other people falsely accused of being gang members. This seems like another false accusation. I will believe Prada Vásquez is innocent until I see actual evidence of him being a gang member, not just allegations.  I'm assuming Prada Vásquez is at CECOT. We all know by now what the conditions are like there. This man doesn't deserve to be there. He needs to be freed and brought back to the US now, along with all the others!",sachiprecious,2025-04-24T22:00:39,1

">Ricardo Prada Vásquez, a 32-year-old Venezuelan immigrant legally residing in the U.S., was working as a delivery driver in January in Detroit and had picked up an order at McDonald’s when he made the wrong turn.  >Prada was detained while attempting to re-enter the U.S. at the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel and was taken into custody and put in detention before he was deported.  A legal resident. They could have checked the footage on the exit/return.   The borders are a quota catch and life changing gamble with little upside to winning.",nerphurp,2025-04-24T21:29:04,1

"Canada really need to put up concrete barriers right at their border so that people can't physically leave the US via this bridge. By letting these people in and then turning them over to US immigration goons Canada has made themselves complicit in what's happening. Remember, during WW2 countries returned fleeing Jews back to the Nazis, with most all of them ending up in the ovens. The great shame of that is why most of the countries in the world, including the USA, signed treaties regulating how refugees are treated, including not arbitrarily sending them back to be killed in the countries they're fleeing. Since the USA has decided to abrogate it's treaty responsibilities, other countries have a moral obligation to not cooperate with the US in sending people to death camps and torture prisons.",noncongruent,2025-04-24T21:48:21,1

"I still don't get the purpose of sending people there and paying for the privilege of doing so.  My first guess was they wanted it as a deterrent. ""*Don't come here or you'll die in a third world death camp!*"" But it seems like the administration is trying to hide all of this, which defeats the purpose.   My second guess was that they're lazy and the deaht camp is more convenient when foreign governments refuse repatriation of actual criminals... but surely they didn't even try in cases like this or Andry Hernandez Romero who had no criminal record whatsoever.   So they went out of their way, and paid money, to send people like this guy and Romero to the death camp, then kept it quiet? That doesn't make sense?  What purpose does this serve besides sadism?",Ut_Prosim,2025-04-24T22:22:05,1
"This is an unfathomable injustice. A guy comes here legally and is doing gig work, makes a wrong turn and gets sent to a foreign death camp. No one who is good does this. What a fucking absolute disgrace on this country.",moonandstarryeyes,2025-04-24T22:36:10,1
