"The question I have… is the loss less than hiring the cashiers that would cover the self checkout people.  Stores operate with an assumption of some loss, that’s nothing new. They aren’t dumb, and had to have known that self checkout would make loss go up.  It has to be “worth it” in that they can move extra product and not have to pay people to scan and bag.   I’m not looking at this in a moral way here just a practical one.  Obviously people shouldn’t steal at all but stores can’t ignore that it does.   I’m curious what those numbers look like.",chillthrowaways,2025-04-16T17:05:31,2
