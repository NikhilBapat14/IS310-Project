"Top 3 Reasons...  1.  He's wrapped up seeking revenge on the departments that he perceived was a threat to himself and his companies.  2.  The investors in his companies are screaming at the top of their lungs for him to stfu and gtfo.  3.  No amount of Ketamine can erase his butthurtedness and triggeredness from the protests and name calling by the ""woke libs"".",HumanRuse,2025-04-22T16:53:37,10

What is DOGE without Musk? Who will take over?,rainshowers_5_peace,2025-04-22T16:51:58,2
"Again, he said he would spend less time on DOGE, which doesn't mean his minions spend less time on destroying America. He still employed BigBalls, remember.  If anyone is lowering their guards down, you already lost to him.",kupomu27,2025-04-22T17:05:59,2
He can't legally work more than 100 days a year for the gov under his current status.  Not like these people follow the rule of law or anything.,deadduncanidaho,2025-04-22T17:16:36,2

"Whoever's running the show at Tesla should find a way to keep him out of the building at all costs.  His inability to refrain from offering women his semen makes him a walking liability, he's a huge distraction from the people who actually know anything about designing and building cars, and the one car he unequivocally had the most design input on turned out to be the industry's biggest flop in decades.  They can't do anything about him damaging the brand with his tweets but at least they can limit the damage he does to operations.",TurboSalsa,2025-04-22T17:01:50,1

"Musk was doing a terrible job running ""DOGE"" when he was doing it full time.  Now Musk is going to oversee ""DOGE"" part time.  So being a cabinet level participant in the Trump administration is a part time job ?  Trump doesn't give a damn about this country.  Trump wants to be king, and it's easier to take total control if the US population is too busy staving off bankruptcy, and keeping food on the table, to protest and fight Trump's fascist takeover.",KrellBH,2025-04-22T20:00:10,1
Tesla's brand will never recover.   Anyone who buys a Tesla now is a MAGA stooge. There are enough other EVs in the market for those who want them.,Tadpoleonicwars,2025-04-22T21:44:55,1
"Good, still not buying your car.",twovles31,2025-04-22T17:08:08,1
He got his ass whupped out of his terrible little project. The damage to the Tesla brand is permanent.   But they were already doomed anyway. By my reading of the auto industry.    But their battery storage and charging business looks promising. Not nearly as cutthroat as cars either. They should throw hard behind that. Start pivoting.  ,Voaracious,2025-04-22T18:04:05,2
[Here’s the main reason.](https://youtu.be/5RpPTRcz1no?si=2sLJEF8YSoatLmsZ)  The plan was originally dubbed RAGE,NegotiationExtra8240,2025-04-22T16:58:21,2

"Also his “Special Gov Employee” status was limited.  I think 120 days?  That’s at the end of May, so…   Leave, so the “shouldnt this be an appointed position?” conversations don’t resume.",rockbottomgeologist,2025-04-22T18:03:12,1

"130, but otherwise, correct.    >A ""special Government employee"" (or ""SGE"") is an officer or employee in the Executive Branch of the Federal Government who is appointed to perform important, but limited, services to the Government, with or without compensation, for a period not to exceed 130 days during any period of 365 consecutive days.",cowboycoco1,2025-04-22T17:47:46,2
