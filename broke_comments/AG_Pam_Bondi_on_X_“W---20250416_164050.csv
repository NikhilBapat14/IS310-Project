What about Epstein?,acreekofsoap,2025-04-16T20:25:01,399

" There is definitely something there about him being a potential gang member given who he was hanging out with during his arrest in 2019. I will however say that beyond hanging around confirmed gang members, the only other evidence that authorities seem to be willing to release is testimony from a confidential informant that has “proven reliable for information regarding gang members and activity.” The entire case hinges on this “confidential informant” being a reliable source of information regarding gang members and their activities.   As is usually the case with stuff like this. People are making judgment calls before all of the information is available. I’m definitely more inclined to believe that he could be a potential gang member than I was a few days ago.",Stea1thsniper32,2025-04-16T18:17:42,88
">""Officers contacted a past proven and reliable source of information, who advised Kilmar Armando ABREGO-GARCIA is an active member of MS-13 with the Westerns clique. The confidential source further advised that he is the rank of ""Chequeo"" with the moniker of ""'Chele'.""  Wew.",Highwiind-D4,2025-04-16T17:20:59,103
"Meh. I think the Trump administration did the right thing (ie he shouldn't have missed his asylum hearing if staying here was so important to him), but ""confidential sources"" still have as little credibility now as they did when they were accusing Trump of various things in 2019",deciduousredcoat,2025-04-16T20:27:15,77
Just read his Wikipedia which was clearly written by a liberal and it still doesn’t make sense. His family was threatened by a gang and said he would have to join unless they paid but they paid their fee. AThen they decided to ship him off to America anyways? He lived here for 8 year never once applied for asylum until he was arrested and I guess his lawyer told him to apply. He couldn’t because he had to do it within a year. Then some judge decide oh he has a good case of threats from gang violence? Why because his family sold food from their house and paid some tax to a gang? They are gonna remember some 16 year 8 year later in a big country like El Salvador? It makes zero sense.   The only thing that makes sense is he was in a rival gang and the gang found out and put a hit on him and that’s why he left.,Graardors-Dad,2025-04-16T17:40:56,20
For those who don't want to read: Garcia was arrested on murder charges. The evidence of him being tied to MS-13 was actually really strong. The order to not deport him was overturned and he was given deportation orders. He had his due process in 2019. Have no clue why it took 6 years from the order to deport to the actual deportation.,theboss2461,2025-04-16T17:06:05,30

Wait so all the people protesting “bring him back” were advocating for an illegal gang member to be released back into the United States?   These people are such pawns it’s ridiculous,Over_Space_2731,2025-04-16T18:02:15,6

"Well a few days ago he was still an illegal immigrant from El Salvador.  Edit: I can understand what you’re saying, and without being rudely dismissive towards YOU; I just don’t care. Don’t care about his wife or kid, don’t care if he went to church, don’t care if he earned an honest living… because that’s not how immigration works. At the very root of the issue, he broke in through a broken system, asylum is a joke 99% of the time. What asylum could Laken Riley have gotten? Or does the US government only have an obligation to protect the lives of foreign nationals fleeing a country that wasn’t even being threatened by said country?",OMGorilla,2025-04-16T22:41:19,-25

"I did read the docs and this is not the conclusion I came to.   I saw a local PD interview record, a DHS record of his detention, a record of his appeal for bond after the IJ denied it (this appeal was dismissed), and the original IJ decision denying him bond.   That last thing is what people are using to defend the indefensible (deporting illegal immigrants to indefinite arbitrary detention), under the claim that ""courts ruled"" Garcia was a member of MS-13. This is incorrect. The IJ determined that Garcia should be denied bond because of the ""evidence,""  provided  by the DHS  (i.e their suspicion), that Garcia was a verified member of MS-13. This was not a habeas proceeding, but a bond hearing. There's nothing about the deportation stay Garcia sought due to being in fear of returning to El Salvador. I don't even think deportation was addressed in these docs.  Side note: interesting discrepancy on the DHS form.  One part said Garcia caimed to be in fear of returning to El Salvador, while another part says he denied being in feared.",NiceSeaworthiness909,2025-04-16T18:01:36,282

The CI had nothing to do with this administration and confirmed this long before he was deported. This was before he had his initial deportation hearing years ago. Read the article.,VerusPatriota,2025-04-17T00:19:19,5
Well the big difference is this informant existed prior to the administration and the testimony is part of why he doesn't have an asylum calm.  This is then anonymous sources say BS the media makes up.,red-african-swallow,2025-04-16T22:08:43,-11
