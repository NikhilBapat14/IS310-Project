"Despite leftists eager to blame Donald Trumpâ€™s tariffs for the consoleâ€™s high price, Nintendo of Americaâ€™s top boss has now said that tariffs had nothing to do with the hotly-anticipated gaming machineâ€™s price.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-16T05:32:49,11
"Anyone else love that Nintendo's American President has the last name ""Bowser!""",wildbackdunesman,2025-04-16T05:49:48,25
It was kinda obvious to anyone paying attention to hardware prices lately. BOM is likely around $400-420. And we know nintendo doesnt sell at a loss like sony and microsoft.,ultrainstict,2025-04-16T05:59:52,27
Gives them room to raise the price later and say it was because of tariffs. ðŸ˜‚,Strange_Chemistry503,2025-04-16T07:28:19,12
"Why is everyone complaining? PS5 sells for $450-700. Xbox is $200-500. Nintendoâ€™s $450 price seems reasonable, compared to the market.Â ",Blahblahnownow,2025-04-16T09:46:19,11
It like people expect their not to be any inflation since 2017. I donâ€™t think the tariffs have had time to affect the prices in the market yet.,whicky1978,2025-04-16T07:06:15,21
Not even just inflation. The hardware in the switch 2 is much newer compared to the switch 1. Og switch used a several year old chip that wasn't even that powerful when it was new. This chip is expectional by today's standards. Then theres all sorts of aupply shortages with chips and nvidia especially being very greedy with pricing in recent years.,ultrainstict,2025-04-16T07:12:04,12
"Video cards are under intense supply and demand pressure, people camp out at the retailer's front door when they hear it's coming so the retailer charges double MSRP ***so the customers buy every card in stock anyway.***   AMD cards are also soaring above MSRP and flying off shelves at the same time, despite Nvidia's lock on non-gaming uses for cards.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-16T09:33:26,5
"I'm pretty sure historically that nintendo tends to gravitate to chipsets and technology that are already easy to mass produce in order to drive down costs.  The Switch had the same CPU as the Nvidia shield.  The Wii had IR lights on the controllers and a sensor bar. A thing that would be easy for them to acquire since it's basically just remote IR lights and tv sensors.  The gamecube cpu was technically custom, but based on a preexisting PowerPC cpu by IBM.  The Game and Watch 2 used a chip already present in calcuators. Also the controllers for the NES are apparently just straight up copied over from the game and watch.  Amiibo are just NFC chips, a thing already used for tracking and for payments.  Switch 2 might be the first time they're not cutting corners by turning an unrelated thing into a video game console. Unless someone can point to an instance of magnetic rails being used for equipment attachment, or the switch 2's hardware being found elsewhere.  Also Nintendo doesn't tend to take losses, so if they're jacking up the price, that's probably how much it cost to make for a profit.",atomic1fire,2025-04-16T15:59:29,1
