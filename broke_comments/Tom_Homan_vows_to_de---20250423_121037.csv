"""Oscar Eduardo Ortega-Anguiano was driving drunk at high speed in 2021 when he crashed into a car carrying 19-year-olds Anya Varfolomeev and Nicholay Osokin. Both teens were killed in the fiery wreck.""   Here illegally kills two teenagers and is getting out 6 years early.  California is a dumpster fire.",Pinot_Greasio,2025-04-23T12:11:50,154

"The people should watch closely at what happens in these days, to see who is on the side of law abiding Americans and who is on the side of criminals.",AstraVolans_21,2025-04-23T13:33:47,26
"*Ortega-Anguiano has a long criminal history, including prior convictions for burglary in 2005, vehicle theft in 2007, and battery with kidnapping in 2014. Homan says those prior offenses, and his repeated illegal re-entry into the country, make the case especially egregious.*  Sounds like a real asset  So all California gave him was 10 years and they didn't even let him serve half?!?!?",indefiniteretrieval,2025-04-23T15:16:57,21
"Can’t get illegal immigrants out fast enough.   I work for a landscape company that has federal contracts and we use e verify. All my people are legal.   We have other non federal contracts where we compete with companies who do hire illegal labor. They can undercut us, work those guys till 7pm every night, and ignore federal law.   How is that fair? My actual American employees are being shafted on raises, bonuses, advancement opportunities, because companies are subverting the law.",Quirky-Marsupial-420,2025-04-23T16:50:58,15
He was only sentenced to 10 years so he wouldn't even serve half the time.,Rush_Is_Right,2025-04-23T17:19:40,24

I absolutely have.  I know the owner of this one particular company who’s doing an amusement park we used to do.   Fuck em. Do it the right way like the rest of us.,Quirky-Marsupial-420,2025-04-23T17:28:08,7
