"Whatâ€™s also really fun is when your neighborâ€™s house is having work done by illegals, and one of them accidentally damages YOUR house in the process, and then your home insurance, the neighborâ€™s contractor, the neighbor, and the police all shrug their shoulders because they all think another party is responsible, no party will claim responsibility because the person was working illegally, and the police wonâ€™t do anything since it happened on private property.Â   Super fun.Â ",G-Gordon_Litty,2025-04-21T21:35:35,13
