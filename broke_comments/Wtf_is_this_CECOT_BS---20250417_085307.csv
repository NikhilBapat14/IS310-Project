"Nothing about that ""smoke"" looks like what smoke looks like in these types of photos. That's a cloud. I understand everyone's concerns about what is going on here but jumping to those types of wild conclusions based on a lack of knowledge does a disservice to everyone.",Messyfingers,2025-04-17T11:13:14,46
"Well given how every accusation by the GQP is actually an indirect confession ü§î..   It‚Äôs def a Cabal of republican pedophiles having a pizza party in that one building, while harvesting Adrenochrome from child sex slaves.. 100% certain of it.",krtyalor865,2025-04-17T13:11:05,22
Remember when the United States would force a country like El Salvador to allow inspectors of the prison to look for human rights violations,commanderfish,2025-04-17T18:52:22,6
"Can we quit with the dumb conspiracies please? We have direct reports of what happens in that prison, we are much better off posting and listing those than posing some blurry google earth image and acting like it‚Äôs direct proof.",Bizlbop,2025-04-17T11:26:29,35

"It's not direct proof. It's a question. What the hell is it? Take into account that no one has seen guys like Kilmore Abrego Garcia since he was expelled to this gulag, he's denied visitation and the government says they can't return him, which they obviously can.   Are they slaughtering these people? I don't care what the state department says.   Proof, from the man himself.    Now there are these photos, though taken some years ago, that show pools of blood outside a tent. Are they for slaughtering animals, or shooting prisoners in the head?",Ssshizzzzziit,2025-04-17T13:02:08,14

"Indeed. But they won't because without question there are things happening there they don't want known. Is it Auschwitz 2.0? Probably not, but I think we CAN safely assume it's a human rights nightmare.",Messyfingers,2025-04-17T18:33:30,5
The conditions are extremely inhumane. One of the most basic issues is severe overcrowding where people are crammed into cells. Prisoners are only allowed outside their cells 30 minutes a day max. They don‚Äôt go outside at all. They are tortured and beaten and are consistently denied medical treatment. They are never allowed visitors.   https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/03/20/human-rights-watch-declaration-prison-conditions-el-salvador-jgg-v-trump-case,Next-Introduction-25,2025-04-17T13:39:31,31

Literally google CECOT and choose any flavor of news outlet you want. And assume any and all images of it that you can see; are the ‚Äúpretty‚Äù side of the prison.,Bizlbop,2025-04-17T21:24:50,0
It's worse than auschwitz. They never see the sun. They just kneel in a line 23.5 hours a day with a hall exercise break.,RowEastern5695,2025-04-17T18:42:09,4
