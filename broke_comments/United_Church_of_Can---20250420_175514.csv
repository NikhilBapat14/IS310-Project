But they told us the Paris Olympics definitely did not represent The Last Supper.  Maybe we don't need Canada as the 51st state after all.,QuietRedditorATX,2025-04-20T23:28:50,17

"United Church of Canada prices just how little they care about Christ, salvation, or the Gospel, or pretty much anything to do with God.   Proves itself a total joke of a church organization.",ITrCool,2025-04-20T19:40:41,24
"Jesus came to call all people to join Him in The Kingdom of Heaven. Accepting Him is the only way to God. However, that isn’t enough. Jesus also gave us guidelines to live by and that not following me these guidelines means that even if you believe in Christ as your Savior, not attempting at all to adhere to the guidelines he set and to live like he did means you will not join Him in Heaven. Only God knows what is in the hearts of these people and it is He who will pass the final judgement on everyone.   All we can do for those that behave like this is to  turn to Jesus and repent for the sins they have committed.",Stea1thsniper32,2025-04-20T19:03:21,18

Mocking God... that's a bold move cotton. Let's see how it plays out for you....,u2sarajevo,2025-04-20T23:16:32,5
Look for every holiday that exists that anyone who doesn’t play into the leftist bullshit in mockery of it there’s going to be mockery of it as if they don’t constantly make new holidays up as much as they make dumbass rhetorics.

The second one from the left reminds me of the kindergarten teacher from Billy Madison. Probably acts like that character too. Singing and dancing while rubbing paste on her face.,Sangmund_Froid,2025-04-20T23:30:16,2

"Most of the Mainline Churches are literally no longer Christian, in that they denounce the Bible, deny that Jesus is God, deny that he died as an atonement for sin, and in some cases doubt the existence of God. They basically just worship leftism, and Jesus is nothing more than a symbolic embodiment of their cause. The funny thing is, even the late Christopher Hitchins called out such churches as not Christian as, though he was an ardent atheist, he recognized that you can’t call yourself Christian unless you affirm the basic tenets of Christianity.",Antisocial_Worker7,2025-04-21T06:44:31,27
"This. I’m 100% for criticism of religion. I personally believe Jesus wanted us to have a direct connection to God, and religion can interfere more than facilitate.  But I take major issue with the self-flagellating left that will criticize everything Western, deride people over their religion, culture, and ethnicity, then say you’re only allowed to do it to white people “because colonialism.”",SpecialistNote6535,2025-04-21T05:17:28,25
That's the thing though. They live (or believe) in a world that is in direct opposition to basically every traditional religion. Christianity seems to be the only one they will actively mock and broadcast contention with.,the_house_from_up,2025-04-20T21:03:38,46
"They are all modernists.  It's why most mainline churches are husks of what they once were and most people go to some ""non-denominational"" church or a traditional schismatic.
