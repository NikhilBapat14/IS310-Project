"They're making the claim that someone else gets elected President, and then resigns in favor of Trump. I find it hard to believe anyone voted for this nightmare the second time.",FrostyAcanthocephala,2025-04-01T01:51:13,142
"> Who would Trump need to get on board with a potential third term?   He would have to get the Supreme Court to agree to whatever argument he's pushing for the 12th and 22nd amendments. This would be considered such a tortured interpretation of the 12th and 22nd that it would go down in legal U.S. history as one of the most politically-biased, and blatantly incorrect decisions.  Basically the only check in place is the Supreme Court. Everything regarding this runs through the Supreme Court. States will try to keep him off the ballot with 12th and 22nd, and that goes straight to the Supreme Court.  > If those checks and balances are sufficiently ignored, what would resistance to a third term look like?  This assumes he wins, which I think is far from a guarantee. While Trump himself seems to have some magical hold on the American electorate that I cannot understand, opening up to third terms means the ancient beast of presidential elections from the Democratic side might come back, that being Barack Obama. The resistance would be exactly that. I have little doubt in my mind that 2028, should the Supreme Court say that Trump can run for a third term, we'd be looking at Obama v. Trump.  In any case, it's not happening. The Roberts Court **will not** agree with those interpretations. The text is clear, and they'll agree.",oath2order,2025-04-01T00:55:44,112
"This is how Putin, who is instructing Trump, did it. Vladimir Putin has stayed in power despite Russia’s two-term limit through a series of political maneuvers: 	1.	The Medvedev Swap (2008-2012) – Russia’s constitution barred more than two consecutive presidential terms, so Putin temporarily stepped down in 2008, becoming prime minister while Dmitry Medvedev took the presidency. During Medvedev’s term, the constitution was amended to extend presidential terms from four to six years. 	2.	Return to Power (2012-Present) – In 2012, Putin ran for president again and won, since the break under Medvedev reset his consecutive term count. He was re-elected in 2018 for another six-year term. 	3.	The 2020 Constitutional Reset – A nationwide referendum in 2020 approved constitutional changes, including one that reset Putin’s previous terms to zero. This allows him to run in 2024 and potentially stay in power until 2036.  These moves, combined with tight control over elections, opposition suppression, and media influence, have effectively ensured Putin’s continued rule. While elections still occur, they are widely criticized as neither free nor fair, with opposition candidates often barred or jailed.",Tronracer,2025-04-01T09:14:06,36
Trump isn’t going to run for a third term.   He’s going to hold rallies for a year raising money for a giant presidential library in Florida. He’ll become kingmaker for the GOP.,slayer_of_idiots,2025-04-01T09:23:23,8
"The 22nd Amendment is ironclad and was very well written (unlike some amendments).  Trump cannot be elected (by the Electoral College) again, period.  And the line of thinking that it only applies to presidents elected to consecutive terms is factually incorrect.  The wording is crystal clear, ""No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice"".  No mention of consecutive terms.  Even this Supreme Court wouldn't disagree.  And even if the conservative justices were inclined to help Trump out, keep in mind that this amendment was ratified in part because a Democratic president served 3+ terms.  Do they want it to happen again?  The 12th Amendment would be up for litigation, probably up to the Supreme Court.  It reads, in part ""But no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States"".  Here, my interpretation of the wording would leave Trump as still eligible to serve as president (or vice president) because he would meet the criteria laid out in the Constitution: over 35 years old, a natural born citizen, and having resided in the US for the past 14 years.  The 22nd Amendment does not disqualify Trump from serving as president again, only from being elected again.  There is one perfectly legal way Trump can serve a third term, without amending the Constitution.  He simply needs to ascend to the presidency without being elected.  He can do so through the order of succession.  If he is either vice president or Speaker of the House, and the president (and vice president, if not him) resigns, voila!  Trump is president again.  That process would have to be repeated during the next presidential term.  There is no limit to the number of terms Trump could serve using this method, except that Father Time is working against him.  A run for a third term in this way would only involve someone running for president as a literal fill in.  While someone else would technically be running as president, would be at the top of the ticket, and would be in the annals of history as the 48th president of the United States, everyone would recognize Trump as the real one running for all practical purposes.  It would be Trump leading the way on the campaign trail, it would be Trump participating in the debates (if the news organizations moderating them even hold debates given the circumstances), and while the Republican presidential nominee would have to formally accept the nomination, it would be Trump giving the last speech at the Republican convention.  It would, admittedly, require the president to relinquish their position to Trump, which takes trust on Trump's part.  But not only would plenty of people be willing to do so because of how popular Trump is among Republicans (and they know they'd never get elected on their own), they would know that their life, even among Republicans, would be a nightmare if they don't.  The Republicans would use every avenue they have to get them out of office because of the betrayal to both Trump and the will of the American people.  The primary check and balance in this scenario is the knowledge that Trump is de facto running for a third term.  Will independent voters elect his proxy president (and by extension, him)?",ANewBeginningNow,2025-04-01T01:33:33,20

"If he tried to run, the first thing that would happen is the first state he tried to get his name on the ballot in their GOP primaries would trigger a lawsuit that would escalated to the Supreme Court very quickly.  I don't see SCOTUS ruling in Trump's favor on that one, so he will be denied being on the ballot.  He will then probably try to encourage his people to do a write-in campaign, but the states won't count those votes because they would be invalid.  While the military may like Trump, I don't see them going against the Supreme Court ruling, so Trump will be done on January 20, 2029.  He would be much better off endorsing a candidate and even rallies for that candidate, but we will see.",mdws1977,2025-04-01T09:12:16,6
"I'm still surprised how many people here fall back on ""Its against the law"" despite numerous occasions of  Trump violating the law.      the best way for this to play out for him would be a couple ways:     \- Create a crisis or war. ""We need solidarity as a country"", ""You don't change the coach in the middle of the game"" etc. etc. Things like this will go over very well with his base and people will just ""go along with it"" because- what else are they going to do? If you oppose it- you're a terrorist trying to disrupt a military operation and you're arrested. And the cover will be- ""Elections aren't cancelled, they're just being delayed until its safe to have them. You didn't complain about Ukraine? Why are you complaining now?""     \- He successfully has the federal government take over Elections due to ""election tampering"" that Elon found in the mid terms. They march out a couple examples of votes being wrong (True or not true) and say that for the safety of the country, they need to make sure the elections are run fairly and safely. He puts himself on the ballot, any court that tries to intervene is labeled as ""activist judges trying to usurp the power of the people"". ""Let the people decide!"" is the battle cry in this scenario. Once he gets the votes, any attempts to say ""this is unconstitutional' will be viewed as taking away the power of the people. ""They decided they want Trump!"" I could see some hiding behind the ""two consecutive terms"" but I doubt they'll even need to go that route once they have the votes.     I think any attempt to do this involves some variation of the above- through some kind of martial law or by leveraging the will of the people vs the court system",MaverickBG,2025-04-01T09:18:48,7

"From the bits and pieces I'm hearing, this is how I think it plays out.   They will argue that the 22nd didn't add a new Constitutional requirement to be President. That it only says you can't be elected three times. Part of the argument will be that the writers knew that there were other ways to assume the Presidency without being elected and chose not to address those. In other words, they could have said you can't serve three terms and choose to word it as elected three times.  The test is if the Supreme Court, or at least five members, will buy in.  Then you just get a patsy to run at the top of the ticket with Trump as the VP nominee and a promise to resign day one.  God I hope I'm wrong.",DisinterestedCat95,2025-04-01T13:18:30,3

"Here's what will probably happen.   Trump announces he's going to run for a third term. The GOP in Congress mumbles something about the Constitution but after a week or two the mantra will be, ""Who cares what the Constitution says, let the voters decide."" He starts campaigning while the courts figure out what to do.   Eventually, it works it's way to to SCOTUS, where they say, ""You definitely can't run for a third term."" Or maybe they agree with a whatever crackpot 12th amendment scheme he's pushing. It doesn't really matter because Trump will ignore them anyway and just do whatever he wants.   When the election comes around, he's probably not on the ballot in a most states (some red states probably have him on the ballot). He frames this as a massive scam, and that he really won the election by like a billion votes or something. He and the admin set up another slate of fake electors to be sent to Congress, where JD Vance approves them (c'mon, what do you think he was brought on for?), giving Trump the election. Chaos ensues as a large portion of the country does not recognize this.   If Trump has stacked the federal government and military with enough stooges, he is able to violently suppress opposition to him. If not, he will leave office after issuing tons of pardons while SCOTUS decides he can't be prosecuted because the Constitution forgot to make coup attempts illegal.",thewerdy,2025-04-01T09:32:59,2

"My thinking on his approach is just to push the fact that the courts can make rulings, but have no power to enforce those rules. The path for trump on this then is just to force the issue. Get Yes men in place in all the Red states, and enough swing states, and get him on the ballot. When the Supreme court tells him he can't, he tells them to try to enforce it. His yes men don't take him off the ballots. He does whatever he needs to, to win 270 based on the states he did get on. Again when the court tries to stop him, he now says the court can't stop the results of an election he won. Once he's back into office, he's immune again, and can pardon any of the federal laws his team may have broken. To protect the state level folks, give them some involvement in other states, that way he has grounds to sue for all of their charges to be moved to federal courts from state courts (where he can then pardon them as well).",Jtex1414,2025-04-01T13:00:06,2

"The way I see it, he'll announce a run for the presidency. Democratic AGs, or the DNC itself, will sue. If the Supreme Court is feeling shitty, it'll say that they don't have standing. But more likely, it'll rule that Trump obviously does not qualify for a third term. Clarence Thomas might even concur!   All the Democrat-controlled states would decline to put him on the ballot, but I imagine many Republican-controlled states would defy the court order, and continue to list him as an option. It's difficult to say how the court could actually enforce the ruling - Trump would still be president through this process, and would allow the states to do as they please.  Assuming there are enough states with Trump on the ballot to win, and he carries all of them, then it would be up to Congress to certify the results. If the GOP win or maintain control, it's feasible that they could certify Trump's victory. And then he'd be sworn in a couple weeks later.  Given what elected Republicans are currently allowing Trump to do, it isn't too far fetched. But this all depends on Trump living that long, and his support remaining sufficiently stubborn.

"Well hypothetically, the first thing you'd need would be a president who has a proven record of not really caring about democracy or what the constitution says. Stuff like issuing executive orders that are blatantly unconstitutional, completely ignoring the results of a legitimate election, or goading his supporters into storming the Capitol Building...   Then they'd need to have a controlling majority in all 3 branches of the US government; legislative, executive, and judicial so he can legitimately amend the constitution with little to no opposition ...  Then they'd need to have enough of a cult following that they are able to convince, coerce, scare, or control the majority of American citizens into believing that he was only doing it for the benefit of the country, freedom, liberty etc etc et, so there isn't a full on civil war...  And lastly, they'd need to be willing to remove, deport, or otherwise silence any of the inevitable dissenters that would oppose the change...  Sounds like Trump to me.

In the general election day, voters are too propagandized to see a difference in the two candidates, so they vote for the white man option because that seems the most safe and they don't know or don't care that he's constitutionally ineligible. When he wins, partly because 4.5M provisional and mail-in ballots were thrown out who'd likely voted for the other candidate, no one in the media or government brings up that he's constitutionally ineligible because the controlled opposition party wants to be ""polite"" and ""civil"" and the election is certified on January 6, 2029, and then he's inaugurated later that month.",3xploringforever,2025-04-01T09:21:26,0

At the end of Trumps term he won't be eligible for Vice President because he has served out two term.  As the constitution reads no one may be elected to the office of President more than twice.  The only feasible way he could run again is if in the mid terms Republicans gain enough seats to beat out the filibuster without democrats help, they would also need to make gains or retain the house as well.  Then the house and senate must pass it then 37 states must approve it so they could change the way the constitution reads.  It would read something like ""No one may hold the office of President more than two terms consecutively or more than three terms non-consecutively.  This change would exclusively apply to Trump due to how rare having non-consecutive terms is as usually if someone is voted out in their first term the public didn't think they did well as president.  This means the only other previous President that is eligible for three terms who is still alive is Joe Biden and he is unlikely to run again.  This is a LONG shot for sure and highly unlikely to happen, the best Trump could do is if JD Vance wins and Trump becomes his advisor so Trump could have his third term with JD doing what Trumps says and subsequently a 4th term assuming JD wins a second term.

"Vladimir Putin has stayed in power despite Russia’s two-term limit through a series of political maneuvers: 	1.	The Medvedev Swap (2008-2012) – Russia’s constitution barred more than two consecutive presidential terms, so Putin temporarily stepped down in 2008, becoming prime minister while Dmitry Medvedev took the presidency. During Medvedev’s term, the constitution was amended to extend presidential terms from four to six years. 	2.	Return to Power (2012-Present) – In 2012, Putin ran for president again and won, since the break under Medvedev reset his consecutive term count. He was re-elected in 2018 for another six-year term. 	3.	The 2020 Constitutional Reset – A nationwide referendum in 2020 approved constitutional changes, including one that reset Putin’s previous terms to zero. This allows him to run in 2024 and potentially stay in power until 2036.

Meanwhile, ""elect the 'Don Jr - Eric' ticket because trump can't be elected again... they'll resign somehow making Trump president based on rules you didn't know about house speaker nomination and succession"" seems like too complicated of a message for trump to ""win"" an election on.

Not to mention that such a plan not only requires two self sacrificingly loyal people to win the election, but also the republicans to not only win/maintain the house but also basically every single house rep to be okay with this.

If major platforms like news networks, Twitter, Facebook, and Threads tweak their algorithms to favor conservative narratives, they don’t need to win public opinion organically—they can manufacture consent, normalize extreme policies, and push their agenda forward, regardless of what voters actually want.",Tronracer,2025-04-02T10:15:02,1

"Technically, his plan could work if he was successfully made Speaker of the House, President Pro-Tempore of the Senate, or (most possible) appointed to the President's cabinet. Of course, the easiest of these is Cabinet appointmemt, and for Trump to become the President through that you'd need at least four people to resign from the Presidency. When the President is replaced through succession like this, the next in line doesn't become the Vice-President, the new president appoints a VP that needs congressional approval. So technically, you could circumvent both the 22nd Amendment's prevention on being elected *and* the issue as to whether or not Trump can be the VP when the 12th Amendment forbids ineligible persons like by having multiple people in on the plan and elected to positions across the federal government.
