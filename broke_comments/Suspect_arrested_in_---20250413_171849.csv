The incident occurred early Sunday morning, around 2 AM, causing significant damage and leading to the evacuation of the Governor and his family.  #### Charges and Motive Balmer faces serious charges, including attempted murder, terrorism, aggravated arson, and aggravated assault. Reports suggest his motive may be linked to his anger over the state auctioning off his property on Canby Street due to mortgage foreclosure, as indicated by court documents from Harrisburg.  #### Current Status He is currently in custody, with charges expected to be formally filed with a probable cause affidavit. The investigation is being handled by the Pennsylvania State Police, involving a multi-agency effort.  ---  ### Comprehensive Survey Note on Cody Balmer's Background  This note provides a detailed examination of Cody Balmer's background, focusing on his recent involvement in a high-profile incident and the circumstances surrounding it. The analysis is based on available public records, news reports, and court documents, ensuring a thorough understanding of his current situation and potential motives.  #### Incident Details and Arrest Cody Balmer, identified as a 38-year-old resident of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, was arrested on Sunday afternoon, April 13, 2025, following an arson attack on the residence of Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. The incident took place around 2 AM, with Balmer allegedly scaling fences, evading state troopers, and using homemade incendiary devices to set fire to the Governor's Residence in Harrisburg. This caused significant damage, leading to the evacuation of Shapiro and his family. The Pennsylvania State Police, led by Colonel Christopher Paris, confirmed Balmer's involvement during a press conference, highlighting the severity of the attack.  #### Charges and Legal Status Balmer faces multiple serious charges, as announced by Dauphin County District Attorney Fran Chardo. These include attempted murder, terrorism, aggravated arson, and aggravated assault against an enumerated person, which involves intentionally causing or attempting to cause serious bodily injury to certain officials during their duties. The charges were expected to be filed early Sunday evening, accompanied by a probable cause affidavit detailing the basis for his arrest. Legally, Balmer is presumed innocent until proven guilty, reflecting the ongoing nature of the legal proceedings.  #### Motive and Property Auction Research suggests Balmer's motive may be tied to his anger over the auction of his property. Court documents from the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County, Harrisburg, indicate that his property on Canby Street was slated for public auction under a writ of execution related to mortgage foreclosure. The sale, conducted at the Dauphin County Administration Building, was at the request of Lakeview Loan Servicing, LLC. This auction appears to have been a significant point of contention, with reports suggesting Balmer was upset with Governor Shapiro over this action, potentially driving his alleged actions.  #### Personal Details and Public Records Public records list Balmer as residing in Harrisburg, with addresses associated with Canby Street and Banks Street. His age, 38, is consistently reported across sources, and there are mentions of phone numbers and potential email addresses linked to him, though these details are less central to his current situation. An alleged Facebook profile has surfaced, but its authenticity has not been verified by authorities, and no official photo has been released yet.  #### Investigation and Context The investigation is being conducted by the Pennsylvania State Police, involving a multi-agency effort, as noted in press conferences. The attack's timing and method suggest a ""very methodic plan,"" according to officials, with Balmer reportedly carrying a homemade explosive device and managing to evade officers initially. This context underscores the seriousness of the incident and the ongoing efforts to understand his background and intentions fully.  #### Impact and Media Coverage The incident has garnered significant media attention, with details widely reported by outlets such as PennLive, Times Now, and Hindustan Times. The attack on the Governor's residence has raised security concerns, and Balmer's alleged actions have been linked to broader discussions about property disputes and public safety. The case remains under investigation, with further details expected as legal proceedings unfold.  #### Tables of Key Information  | **Category**         | **Details**                                                                 | |----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------| | Name                 | Cody Balmer                                                                | | Age                  | 38                                                                         | | Residence            | Harrisburg, PA (Canby Street, Banks Street, Penbrook area)                  | | Arrest Date          | Sunday afternoon, April 13, 2025                                           | | Related Incident     | Arson at Governor’s Residence, early Sunday morning, around 2 AM           | | Charges              | Attempted murder, terrorism, aggravated arson, aggravated assault           | | Legal Status         | Presumed innocent, charges to be filed with probable cause affidavit        | | Investigating Agency | Pennsylvania State Police, multi-agency investigation                       | | Possible Motive      | Anger over property auction due to mortgage foreclosure                    |  | **Property Auction Details** | **Information**                                                      | |------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------| | Address                      | Canby Street, Harrisburg, PA                                         | | Auction Location             | Dauphin County Administration Building, Commissioners Hearing Room   | | Auction Conducted By         | Lakeview Loan Servicing, LLC                                         | | Legal Basis                  | Writ of execution, mortgage foreclosure                              | | Court Document Source        | Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County, Harrisburg, PA              |  #### Conclusion This survey note compiles all available information on Cody Balmer's background, focusing on his recent arrest and the circumstances surrounding the arson attack on Governor Shapiro’s residence.
