"On *Free Speech Unmuted*, [Eugene Volokh](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/eugene-volokh) and Jane Bambauer discuss the Trump administration’s freezing of grants to Harvard and Harvard’s lawsuit challenging the freeze. Volokh and Bambauer also consider the legal propriety of the administration’s demands that Harvard change many of its policies and practices in order to get back in the government’s good graces. President Trump has also suggested that Harvard might lose its tax-exempt status for “pushing political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting ‘Sickness.’” Would such a cutoff of funding or tax exemption benefits violate the First Amendment? Bambauer and Volokh dig deep into that, offering their unique perspectives as longtime scholars of free speech and expression in the American legal context. ",HooverInstitution,2025-04-23T15:55:43,1
