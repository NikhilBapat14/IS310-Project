"https://muat.ups.com/us/en/supplychain/resources/glossary-term/blank-sailing   When an ocean carrier cancels or skips a scheduled port of call or region in the middle of a fixed rotation, that route is considered a Blank Sailing (also called a Void Sailing).  In addition, a carrier may decide to plan a blank sailing if bad weather, port congestion, or other situations cause delays that impact shipping schedules. ***And if there isn‚Äôt much freight to pick up or drop off at a particular port, or if equipment availability there is low, a carrier may schedule a blank sailing to pass up that port and quickly reposition the ship on a more in-demand portion of the lane.***  Blank sailings can present obvious challenges for shippers. If your goods were planned for loading or unloading at a skipped port, you will have to arrange alternate transportation to move the goods to/from a new port, which will require additional expense and may delay the arrival of the cargo. And for temperature controlled or perishable goods, a blank sailing can mean the total loss of your shipment.  Shipping companies do make efforts to inform customers ahead of time if they are planning to blank a sailing, and your cargo will generally be loaded onto the next available vessel (which in most cases won‚Äôt be too far away), but you get some reassurance from maintaining a supply of ‚Äúemergency‚Äù stock and having a good backup plan for alternate transportation in the event your shipment is affected by a blank sailing.  Note: When a vessel‚Äôs entire voyage is cancelled, we call this ‚Äúblanking the string‚Äù.",tech57,2025-04-24T18:38:29,1

"It's easier to use harsh control. In normal times you keep people panicked, fighting over money, and unsatisfied. Wage slave.
