Don Bacon who is my congressman. To give you some idea why he‚Äôs taking this stand; Bacon did a virtual town hall and 17k people were present on the phone or via their computer.

It's almost like Trump hired only people into his cabinet whose sole qualification for the job was the fact that they kiss his feet rather than because they could actually do the job. Most likely because anyone who COULD do the job would be too smart and driven to kiss Trump's feet even if still corrupt. Otherwise he would have found someone who could do both and avoided messes like this.,immortalfrieza2,2025-04-22T10:05:06,2

"Hey Pete, the Department of Defense DevSecOps Strategy Guide shows you specific diagrams for reference architectures of applications that can and cannot be used to send information like this.  If you need a copy please find it here: [https://DefenseTeamHuddle.com](https://DefenseTeamHuddle.com) and click on the ""***DoD SecOps PDF***"" link.  Page 8 shows you what communications pipelines can be used, and page 10 essentially calls out that Signal is not allowed at all, regardless of whether the information is classified.  Specifically, as an example:   ***- For weapons systems, the environment will likely continue to be on premise to facilitate hardware-in-to-loop (HWIL) testing with embedded systems.***   ***- The DoD must acknowledge a lock-in posture; recognizing vendor lock-in, and recognizing product, version, architecture, platform, skills, legal, and mental lock-in also exist.2 Avoiding vendor lock-in without considering other types of lock-in is ill-advised. Finally, nothing is more dangerous than mental lock-in.***  # And of specific interest:  The cybersecurity and risk postures of a specific artifact or application must be calculated using the product rule across the entirety of the software supply chain. If the compiler is 90% secure, the code repository is 90% secure, the artifact repository is 90% secure, and the container orchestrator is 90% secure ‚Äì the overall system is not 90% secure. The cybersecurity level of the end-to-end ecosystem is actually .9 \* .9 \*.9 \* .9, or roughly 65% secure. **This is why the creation of hardened DoD Enterprise DevSecOps Reference Designs are so critical;** DevSecOps aims to harness the collective expertise and knowledge across the entire software supply chain to mitigate risk at each step. Only then can the overall cyber survivability of the ecosystem significantly increase. To further illustrate this point, if a DevSecOps team only increases security 5%, raising each level from 90% to 95%, then overall cyber survivability jumps from 65% to 81%.",BuysTooMuch,2025-04-23T10:09:06,1
