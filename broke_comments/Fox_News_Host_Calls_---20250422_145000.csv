"It's a hell of a situation, honestly. But the short version is that yes our Conservative leader has been using a *lot* of MAGA-adjacent rhetoric over the past couple years.  But with the shitshow in the US since Trump's inauguration, that has backfired. The Conservatives have failed to pivot away from the anti-woke bullshit, and that's hurt them a lot.  Two or three months ago they would have sailed to an easy majority victory, but now it's looking like the Liberals are gonna pull off the majority instead - but like I said, I'm not counting chickens.  It's been a roller coaster.",redditonlygetsworse,2025-04-23T17:25:11,1
