"Unfortunately impeachment is a purely partisan process in this political era. Whether or not Trump & Vance can be impeached has nothing to do with their actions and everything to do with the partisan make-up in Congress.   The Trump administration is breaking the law. The leaked signal texts is proof that they're ignoring the freedom of information act with regards to records retention, Musk's million dollar checks is a violation of WI election law, DHS has ignored Court ruling with deportations, numerous executive orders have been rejected by courts yet still implemented to various degrees, and that is all just the stuff we have clear visibility on.   During Trump's first term his Personal Lawyer, Campaign Manager, Campaign Financial Officer, National Security Advisor, and others in his orbit were convicted of Felonies committed on Trump's behalf. Trump himself was convicted of numerous felonies and sexual assault. The public didn't care. The public doesn't take it seriously that Trump is capable of breaking law. The attitude seems to be that as President he can do anything and all push back is just partisan opposition.   So we are stuck. Congress won't impeach and the public won't support impeachment.",8to24,2025-04-03T05:24:09,10

"First, yes.  An impeachment would put on record, in an organized way how they have abused power, etc.  If there is Democratic majority, I have no doubt we'll see impeachments not just of Trump and Vance, but of a few cabinet secretaries as well.  What happens in the Senate is a totally different story. Yes, you need 67 votes to remove someone from office. That will all depend not just on whether or not the GOP Senate caucus found its balls, but other things:  if this tariff insanity is still in place and the country is in a deep, protracted recession/depression.  If the 2026 elections were like 1974 where Democrats absolutely destroyed the GOP (taking 45 House and four Senate seats from them), then we might see actual convictions.  On top of that improbably, what makes it all even more unlikely, is if Congress were to jettison Trump and Vance in 2027, then control of the White House goes to whoever the Democratic Speaker of the House is- right now, that would be Hakeem Jeffries.  The level of bad things would need to be in this country for well over a dozen GOP senators to vote to put a Democrat in the White House is to scary to even contemplate.  What is slightly more likely, is they dump Trump, Vance becomes President but Congress keeps a leash on him- overriding anything he does that they do not like.

Impeachment proceedings are usually a disaster for a party trying to do this. They tried it on Clinton and it backfired. Democrats tried it on Trump and it backfired. Now I was surprised people weren’t smart enough to remove the GOP from congress this past election after their waste of taxpayers money going after the Joe and Hunter Biden. But I guess it never came to full impeachment as it was just an investigation. I am an independent voter that maybe leans slightly to the left but not too much.   From everything I have witnessed in these past couple months I truly believe the GOP is in big trouble. The special elections in Florida and the Supreme Court seat in Wisconsin may be a sign of things to come. We saw the democrats cut the winning percentage the GOP had in districts by 50% in Florida and in Wisconsin we saw a democrat win in spite of Elon Musk and Trump endorsed candidate. Now special elections may not bring out everyone and usually the party that is needing to win has more motivated voters. And in most instances I would say there is nothing to see here.  But with the town halls being disasters for GOP and the massive protests happening all around the country because of the Tariffs and DOGE gutting our agencies it should make peoples antennas go up. Last time a party tried to use Tariffs it destroyed that party for nearly 50years. People were complaining about the prices of things being too high under Biden but at least they had jobs to at least try and get by. Now with Tariffs it’s essentially the single biggest tax increase on the American people. With the stock market crashing companies are being forced to layoff hundreds of not thousands of workers and the tariffs are going to increase the price of almost everything. You’re going to have a higher unemployment rate with goods costing way more than they ever have. This is a good way to lose your power politically. It’s too late for most of these GOP leaders to distance themselves from Trump come 2026. I believe there will be hell to pay. I fully expect the democrats to take an overwhelming majority in congress and take the senate as well.   Now why I don’t think it will be wise to waste time going after Trump to have him removed because it will rally his supporters and the GOP. Why waste the time and resources. The goal should be to win the White House in 2028. The damage will have already been done by 2026 so might as well let that train go off the cliff for the next two years and for the democrats to just keep Trumps power in check. So many people will be hurting by 2028 and I think the country will still be turned off by the GOP we could see the democrats control all three legislative branches of government. But if the democrats go after Trump then unfortunately in 2028 we could be in for more pain and misery. But no matter what happens it will take years to recover from what’s already happened. America made its bed by electing Trump and now we must all lay in it. ,BrilliantWorth6629,2025-04-06T17:00:41,1
"I submitted this to my Congress representatives:      I am writing to you as a concerned citizen and constituent to urge you to support the impeachment of President Donald J. Trump.    My reasons are as follows:   1. Violation of Constitutional Norms: He has repeatedly suggested and promoted the idea of running for a third term, which directly contradicts the 22nd Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.   2. Suppression of Free Speech: He and his administration have arrested or incurred severe repercussions on US residents for expressing their opinions. These actions are a violation of the First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech and peaceful protest.   3. Erratic and Harmful Decision-Making: He has demonstrated a lack of mental fitness for leadership through irrational policy decisions—such as imposing sudden and sweeping tariffs on key U.S. trade partners with absolutely meaningless justification. These decisions have caused unnecessary harm to American businesses and workers.    4. Alarming Ties to Foreign Adversaries: His consistent deference and favorable treatment toward the Russian government raise serious concerns about undue foreign influence over his actions and decisions while in office.   5. Blatant Favoritism Toward Donors: He has openly favored major campaign donors, including granting them tariff exemptions and publicly endorsing their products, suggesting a misuse of presidential power for personal or political gain.   These are not trivial concerns. They strike at the heart of our democracy, the rule of law, and the integrity of our institutions.

When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: **And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present.**  Both the house and senate do not require all their members to be present, only a quorum (50% + 1). So the senate could legally hold an impeachment trial and convict with 51 members present and thus 34 votes would be 2/3 of that 51.  Now, I think this would be a terrible idea.

Accused, the left needs to remember that word exists for more than just the people police kill, it applies to those democrats kill as well.",TheMikeyMac13,2025-04-03T14:13:00,1
Obama? Who went to bed during the Banghazi attack? Who killed a US citizen on purpose?  Take off the bike tinted glasses.,TheMikeyMac13,2025-04-03T16:06:19,2
"I think Democrats will win just about everything except what you've labeled solid R. Trump voters are less likely to vote in midterms, and the economy is not likely to be in good shape then.",Sam_k_in,2025-04-04T11:42:55,1
Again not saying there isn’t an issue - but you are engaging in whataboutism and in particular a weak case of it. AUMF for war on terror and expansion of executive authority under bush set the stage for the legality of it. Maybe we should restrain the executive branch more?,Heliomantle,2025-04-03T14:14:50,3
"Agreed, start with whomever you want, but rein it in.  But it isn’t whataboutism, if people don’t care what Obama murdered a US citizen without due process, they don’t have a leg to stand on with far lesser offenses against the accused. These people are still alive.",TheMikeyMac13,2025-04-03T14:32:11,1
"It is because this was one person over 8 years, unless they thought he presented a clear and imminent danger or had been they wouldn’t have done it. I hate to to give gov the benefit of the doubt but I am inclined to given this context.  Now think about what Trump has done in just 3 months. Then add his last term.  So yeah bringing up Obama in this context is whataboutism and a pretty lame case of it at that.",Heliomantle,2025-04-03T17:32:45,2
"So we are talking “benefit of the doubt” for a government who did what they did at Ruby Ridge, preparing to honor the sniper who shot a child in the back until a whistleblower spoke up, and who burned everyone to death in Waco. Hell the Dallas police had a sniper at a protest, waited him out till he was out of ammo, and after 45 minutes of no gunshots, during negotiation, they sent in a bomb robot with a bomb and blew him up. That was an extrajudicial killing.  They don’t get the benefit of the doubt, our civil rights have to mean something or they mean nothing. Obama should never have approved the targeting of a US citizen, Congress should have impeached him, and nobody should defend the act.  It was the worst act by a modern President, going back at least to Nixon’s alleged treason.  Just look at the replies I have gotten, the left defends Obama killing a US citizen, I don’t care what they get mad about if that is what they cheer.  Edit- addition  And by the way, if you think it was only going to be one you are kidding yourself. After they killed the US citizen, and the uproar grew, Eric Holder was asked in Congress if they thought they could use a drone to kill a US citizen on US soil, and he answered that he didn’t think that would ever be needed.  A remarkably dangerous answer that drew high levels of outrage. Only after this did Obama admit they could not, and they never did it again.",TheMikeyMac13,2025-04-03T17:44:41,0
