"It's astonishing how something so fundamental to so many people, especially in rural areas, is jeopardized by vested interests. It seems to me we too often forget that correspondence isn't just about mail and letters; it's about connection, it's about community. This should concern us all",HoneyDusk_,2025-04-24T14:05:56,31
"So long USPS, you were a great affordable option that reached every address in America, as well as providing additional services.",Prudent-Blueberry660,2025-04-24T14:20:54,12
"We sounded the alarm with Louis DeJoy. We knew this was coming. If there is a critique I have of the Biden administration is them not working on the Board members enough. They could have pressured them in various ways to force his ouster. They chose to be ""middle ground"" on that one. We are paying now.  Expect XPO to come in with private contracts for this one.",williamgman,2025-04-24T14:11:18,19

I heard in my area USPS is no longer doing mail pickup after 11 AM. Seems like a severe reduction in distribution.,philovax,2025-04-24T18:53:40,1

"Package for me was mailed from FL to a New England state on March 3rd. Finally showed up at the local post office, sent out for delivery today. Mail person delivered to the wrong house and “they are unable to retrieve” it. They’ve already been dismantled.",BostonSpike,2025-04-24T14:53:35,-1

"I would guess that the government is one of if not the largest customer of the postal service , privatization would increase profits to the wealthy and increase government spending,another brilliant move to enrich the 1%.",Senior-bud,2025-04-24T15:32:41,1

"It's about $4 for Denmark as of 2020.  The U.S. has about the cheapest first class postage of any country in the developed world. This is remarkable considering how freaking big this country is. It's one thing to be able to get a letter across a country like Denmark, but it's quite another two send a letter from Miami to Portland Oregon. And yet we do it at a fraction of the price.   https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2020/08/us-postal-rates-versus-other-countries/",Unique-Coffee5087,2025-04-24T15:08:59,19
"It'll be $8 to mail and take 1.5 weeks to get across town. Conversely, it'll cost $7.99 to pay your electric bill online, but $12.99 if you want the payment processed in the next 5 days. Otherwise it'll be the next 7-10 working days.",chicklette,2025-04-24T18:35:45,1
