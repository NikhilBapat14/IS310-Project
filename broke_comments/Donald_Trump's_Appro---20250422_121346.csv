If Democrats re-take the house they could throw a lot of light on midterm election weirdness through hearings.  Further, Elon Musk is significantly less popular right now than he was at the end of last year.

AOC was at the DNC and Liz Cheney didn‚Äôt make 8 million people decide Trump should win.,Carl-99999,2025-04-22T18:26:35,2
"Kamala was a terrible candidate who ran a terrible campaign, full stop. This ""election stolen"" nonsense is just some bullshit the Republicans would pull.  After 2016 you'd think you people would learn that ""YOU HAVE TO VOTE FOR US BECAUSE TRUMP BAD!"" isn't a winning campaign. Biden at least had the benefit of winning a primary. Kamala was run out of town on a rail and outright REJECTED by millions of primary voters. And then they foisted her on them anyways 4 years later and you're shocked that a candidate who spectacularly lost on the national stage lost yet again.  In California alone, her home state, she lost 2 million votes compared to Joe. Did Trump hack California's election? Did Trump hack New York's election and cause her to lose half a million votes in New York? She lost votes compared to Joe in every single blue state with their blue state governments. Did Trump hack every single blue state and lower her vote count?  Or maybe, just maybe, she was a terrible candidate that couldn't turn out the vote?",TheBigLeMattSki,2025-04-22T18:49:14,0
