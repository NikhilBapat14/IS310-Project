"Trump started the trade war, now China says they’ll only talk if he drops the tariffs. Problem is—he’s out of cards, out of leverage, and still pretending he’s holding a royal flush.",CheetahPatient6926,2025-04-24T10:52:39,3
"the conservative subreddit is praising this all as a win, but the rest of the world sees Trump as the coward and loser he is.  He has no ability to negotiate or win trade deals.  he's a toddler throwing a tantrum and the rest of us are paying the price.",Archer1407,2025-04-24T11:35:44,3

"At this time, it is all about who can tolerate more disruption in their economies and how their respective population react. MAGA supports Trump, not necessarily the majority of Americans. China has significantly more control over its population.  However, there are no winners.",PsychLegalMind,2025-04-24T10:45:16,1
"Some tidbits,    > That historic U-turn comes to mind as we watch Mr. Trump execute a reversal by stages in his tariff agenda. First he carved out space for Mexico and Canada from his reciprocal tariffs. Then he put his reciprocal tariffs on everyone except China on a 90-day pause. Then the Customs bureau gave exceptions to Apple, Nvidia and big electronics companies. Now comes word that Mr. Trump may substantially cut his 145% tariff rate on China. > That’s a long way in three weeks from the declarations by White House aide Peter Navarro and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick that there would be no tariff-rate changes. It’s hard to see this as anything other than a retreat amid the harsh reaction of financial markets, worries about recession and price increases, and a sharply negative reaction from the rest of the world—friend and foe.  >  > The CEOs of Walmart, Home Depot and Target paid a visit to the White House this week and told Mr. Trump prices would soon rise and store shelves might soon be empty as the tariff impact grows. This would be more than the “little disturbance” Mr. Trump warned about when he first unveiled his tariff barrage. >  > Another harsh reality is that China called Mr. Trump’s bluff and seems to have won this round. When Mr. Trump imposed his tariffs in the first term, President Xi Jinping retaliated with some restraint and sent a delegation to negotiate a trade deal. > This time he retaliated in tit-for-tat fashion and pushed all of his anti-U.S. economic and diplomatic levers. He has cut off U.S. access to crucial rare-earth minerals, stopped the delivery of Boeing jets, looked elsewhere for food and natural-gas imports, and unleashed regulators against American companies. >  > Beijing has also warned countries not to do trade deals with the U.S. that exclude China—or else. With even U.S. allies facing Mr. Trump’s tariff assault, Beijing’s threat has resonated in a way that it never previously did. U.S. diplomatic sway is ebbing.",tech57,2025-04-24T11:13:06,1

Tariff is money paid to a company who paid it to the government.  Income tax is money paid to the government.  The tariff does not replace income taxes. It just changes the flavor of the lube.,tech57,2025-04-24T11:16:36,5
