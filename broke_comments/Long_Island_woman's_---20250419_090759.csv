"Lol they should have let her try. More athletic people half her age routinely fail. I mean it's good for her that she's in shape, but basic fitness, scuba certification, and once shooting an AR from a bench won't make you a Navy SEAL.",Mountain_Man_88,2025-04-19T10:05:11,29
So here's someone else who wants the world break the rules to adapt to her fantasy.,triggernaut,2025-04-19T09:11:21,32
">“I was working in litigation for 12 years, and I kind of got burnt out working 24/7...""  She got burnt out working 24/7 so she wanted to become a SEAL?  As a SEAL, after your initial training, you are always training and on call 24/7.  If you're not actively engaged in something, you're training.  Something tells me she might have had a shot at passing the physical part of SEAL training but I would question her judgment.",DreadPirateGriswold,2025-04-19T11:15:14,19
Letting her try is a waste of money but probably costs less than litigation,jasommer14,2025-04-19T10:08:44,20
"War is a young man's game. 40 years old might be enough to get into regular military, but I doubt any special forces would accept someone that old, male or female.  If I was recruiting someone to train into a special forces soldier, I'd probably look at current soldiers in their 20s first.",RossBot5000,2025-04-20T07:58:10,4
"Two sides to this.  1 - People have to understand it isn't about their personal dreams or desires. It's about putting the most capable, high caliber people out there who might end up in incredibly high stress, high demand situations with huge stakes. This isn't about you fulfilling your lifelong fantasy. It's about the failure or success of a mission that might literally hold lives or national security in the balance.   That said,  2 - It seems she is suing for the chance to reinstate her application, which she was previously told could be accepted with an age waiver. Which means, as of now at least, she's not suing for a cash grab, but for the chance to apply through an already existing waiver process and try. I can respect that.   As tech and medicine improve and people start to have better health at later ages, the limits might well need to be reconsidered in time. I don't think it's a terrible ask to be able to, presuming there is already a waiver process available, proceed with applying/testing and seeing how she does.   Cynically, I will say it's almost definite that she will fail. And, assuming there are fitness tests and etc prior to even beginning the proper bootcamp, she would have to pass those even to be considered for full bootcamp or whatever the next step is.",onemanmelee,2025-04-19T11:23:09,11
"Training a SEAL is **extremely** expensive.  The US taxpayer deserves as many years of military service as possible given the costs involved.      Age is an important factor when considering one’s potential longevity.  And science hasn’t come anywhere close to closing the age gaps that are strong today, cartilage still wears out, adding muscle becomes more difficult with every passing year, and more.",cliffotn,2025-04-19T16:25:51,6
"Yeah I don't necessarily disagree. I admittedly don't know the process. My assumption is that before you even qualify for the expensive training, you have to pass some serious tests, including physical ones.   My argument is, if she via the waiver process qualifies for those tests, I'm not against her taking them. Googling now though, looks like the waivers might only be for people 29-30 years of age, not 41. In which case, she simply doesn't qualify even for the testing.",onemanmelee,2025-04-19T17:30:46,4
