"It's interesting how he talks about loneliness and low self-esteem among the members of these groups. Not necessarily the leaders or true believers, but the followers, how they're fairly normal guys who seem to literally just want a reason to get out of the house and talk to people.  I don't know any right-wing extremists myself, but I feel like I've known the kinds of guys who could fall down that rabbithole in the right circumstances. It's like any other kind of manipulation, in a way. But I've also known the kinds of angry white guy who was like... he's a loser, he knows he's a loser, but he really wants to be able to lean on ""white guy"" to give him a boost in society, to give him some status he can't create for himself. What's that saying about how it doesn't matter how shitty your life is as long as you're still better than some other outgroup?  That seems to be behind a lot of racism, and also a lot of incel stuff. Being a guy women want to date, actually  treating a woman in a way that makes her enjoy being around you, feels impossible, so you yearn for the days when women had to marry any asshole who showed up. Her actual happiness is beside the point.",86throwthrowthrow1,2025-04-24T17:19:21,1
"It's just ""the right.""  People like Adam Kinzinger and Liz Cheney are the ones on the right-wing fringe. The fascist lunatics are the mainstream right.",wonkalicious808,2025-04-24T16:20:03,1

I’ve know several extremists and this all seems pretty accurate. Most of them are deeply insecure people at their core.,ViennaSausageParty,2025-04-24T18:32:14,1
"I'm pretty sure women never married any asshole who turned up and there were lonely unmarried men at any point in the past. Some societies didn't let women choose who to marry but fathers wouldn't just marry their daughters to some utter loser, they wanted someone who could bring something to the family.",PatchyWhiskers,2025-04-24T21:20:58,1

I'm struck by how lonely a lot of these people are. It's easy enough to brush off epidemic loneliness as some made-up crisis or media doom-squawking. It's not until you see the dark places people will go to find company that you understand the implications.,ArchdukeAlex8,2025-04-24T17:26:56,1
"It's the same right in the Brexited U.K. and in the U.S. and most other countries. They're all doing something like ""listening to hours-long fascist live streams."" They all have conspiracies about a shadowy cabal that wants to ""extinguish the white race"" or whatever other race they fantasize about being entitled. Do you think the British right is special in being afraid ""white people will one day become a minority due to high immigration and low birthrates""?",wonkalicious808,2025-04-24T17:38:51,1

"Also when social safety nets are gutted, you make people feel like no one is watching out for them so when a group comes along that pretends to care half the recruiting work has already been done.
