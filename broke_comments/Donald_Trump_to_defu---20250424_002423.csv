Trump doesn‚Äôt care if LGBT youth commit suicide. Just like he doesn‚Äôt care if poor children lose Head Start. He is evil and overwhelmingly supported by evangelicals. It doesn‚Äôt make any sense.,Adept_Statement_4980,2025-04-24T00:47:38,174
"What benefit could they possibly extract, that is worth depriving life-saving mental health services to thousands of LGBT Americans?  This administration has proven itself to be rather wicked, maybe that's the point.",Landon-Red,2025-04-24T00:42:30,56
He is continuing to make more and more of you targets. It's only a matter of time before YOU are his target. Why isn't he yours?,EnragedBasil,2025-04-24T00:52:08,46
Here is the fun part. I bet he isn‚Äôt even give a shit if people are gay or not. He does this so his maga people are having a victory‚Ä¶.

"If you really care about this and are in a position to offer money, [The Trevor Project ](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/)is specifically focused on suicide prevention in LGBTQ+ youth. They have denounced Trump MANY MANY MANY a time. You can make your donations to them. I can imagine they're about to spend a fortune in advertising, following this.  I'm not from TTP, I'm just the messenger so I'm not ENTIRELY sure about this, but they do have other options including [volunteering positions](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/volunteer/) if you want to give back in other ways.  Explore their website, check it out.",IslandFearless2925,2025-04-24T07:02:47,17
They‚Äôll be replacing it with a call center that calls *you* if they think you‚Äôre an lgbt youth to try to harass you into committing suicide.,specqq,2025-04-24T02:49:11,15

"The point is to have the lgbtq community eliminate itself so they don‚Äôt have to spend money on eliminating it.   Well guess what trumpy? We‚Äôve been here since the beginning of recorded history.

"He's an imbecile but he's always been a politician.  His businesses dealt directly with consumers.  I can't imagine a reality where he would deliberately say that a 3rd of the American public was stupid, especially in the 80s when conservatism was at a zenith under Reagan.   He had a hard enough time staving off bankruptcies without deliberately alienating 10s of millions of people.  What is happening to Musk today would have happened to Trump then.  The still photo most commonly used in the memes that portend that he said it, are from an Oprah appearance, where he never said that.   He happily called politicians stupid, but not an entire group of voters.  I'm more concerned with the things he provably did say like telling Larry King that GHWB might come to regret coming out strongly against David Duke.",ruler_gurl,2025-04-24T16:23:10,1
