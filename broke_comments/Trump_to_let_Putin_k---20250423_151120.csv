Trump isn’t in charge of Europe. He can’t stop Europe from making any treaty it wants with Ukraine. He’s also pretty much made NATO worthless.,Choice_Cup_3624,2025-04-23T15:28:32,3

What you said and what I said aren't mutually exclusive.  The EU can admit Ukraine into their bloc if they want and its something between the EU and Ukraine.   And how does this make NATO worthless?,wizgset27,2025-04-23T15:33:24,1
