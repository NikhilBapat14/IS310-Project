"Is that what he meant about “Make America Great Again”?   “Let’s bring back slavery”?   Sure seems like Corporate America is also in the “pro slavery” camp these days. Worker’s rights are under attack, and in Florida, they are passing laws to legalize child labour….Hmm",Paulie_Walnuts1984,2025-04-24T04:10:41,28
"One of my neighbors owns an antebellum plantation down the road from us.  I am an advocate of non-violence however the very thought that white people celebrate weddings where once slaves were property, forced to labor in the hot sun all day then beaten if they didn’t comply makes me sick.  I mean, what, Dachau was booked for the night?    I say this as a member of proud bi-racial families on both my husband’s & my side of the families, descended from both Slaves & Slave owners: Weddings at labor Camps are fucked up.",Abydos_NOLA,2025-04-24T04:19:13,17

I worked in Historic Trades at Mount Vernon - school groups had the opt out option for hearing about George Washington’s role in slavery.  Guess which groups where prominent in that ? Hint - not school groups from the North.,True-Sky2066,2025-04-24T07:32:16,3

It’s all because America is at the end stage of the Paradox of Tolerance.   We took an appeasement approach to “unify” the country versus stomping bigotry out during Reconstruction.   And what you’re seeing play out today is because America didn’t do what Germany and Europe did.,gamesandsnacks,2025-04-24T04:55:10,11
"> Weddings at labor Camps are fucked up.   This makes me wonder: should our discomfort stop at places we're culturally close to? What about global landmarks also built on slavery, exploitation, atrocities and stolen wealth. Like the Cathedral of Seville enriched by colonial gold, the Great Wall of China built through slave labor and death, Chichen Itza shaped by human sacrifice, or Belgian palaces funded by Congo's suffering? I'm not saying it's all the same, but maybe the deeper question is how we honor truth and treat places that exist today because of the suffering others went through for those places to exist - and are now places we go to appreciate their beauty or meditate or take pictures.",mentales,2025-04-24T07:45:10,1

"Even they didn't go far enough to correct their Nazi problem. That's why so few war criminals were executed during the Nuremberg Trials. It's also why Germany had prominent Nazi war criminals (Hans Speidel and Adolf Heusinger) commanding the Bundeswehr in 1955, just a decade after serving as officers for the Wehrmacht in Nazi Germany.   Another is Kurt Waldheim, who was a secretary-general for the UN and later the President of Austria. He was an intelligence officer for the Wehrmacht and had intimate knowledge of massacres that his unit carried out. Given his position, he absolutely played a role in these crimes even if he didn't pull the trigger himself. Civilians were often executed within a few hundred yards of his office.   The list goes on. Of course, this is to say nothing of all the Nazis that the US (Operation Paperclip), Russia, and Argentina (Operation Land of Fire) took in after the war. I think Russia only took in a few, who ended up working for the Stasi in East Germany and continuing their brutality.",DifferenceAlarmed45,2025-04-24T05:24:11,3
"It didn’t work in Germany whatever you think they did   AfD is basically a party of dickheads who openly question if Hitler was that bad really and want to send everyone who they don’t think is German enough back to their AfD determined ‘homeland’, and they are a large and growing force in German politics.   You can’t eliminate the hatred and those who capitalise on it until you eliminate inequality. As long as someone is able to demonstrate that they are left behind in some way you will have grievance and those who manipulate it.",Drolb,2025-04-24T05:25:00,4
"There’s a plantation near me on the Delta that was owned by Judah Benjamin, the Confederate Sec of State.  He also served as Sec of War & Attorney General.  His plantation, Belle Chasse, was used as the holding “pens” they chained slaves to before they last leg of the journey to market in NOLA.  The room that they hold wedding receptions in?  They market and call it “Spirits Hall.”  For real. Exploiting the extreme suffering of kidnapped people who barely survived an ocean crossing will forever curb memorialized as the where your cousin made a jackass fool of himself.

There’s only ONE reason I want slash & burn budget for Plamtations:  it is offensive on a deeply human level to hold sacred ceremonies (which marriage is) on the same site human beings were sold like cattle.    If it were up to me I’d raze every last one of them to the ground—and my ancestors owned a plantation. I recall learning that the term Roman Candle came the Centurions’ practice of cruicifying Christians on streets then light them on fire as street lamps.  I don’t want to be barbarians again. I really don’t.,Abydos_NOLA,2025-04-24T09:05:56,1
