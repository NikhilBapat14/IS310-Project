How the fuck does that happen? As the economy improved and jobs were gained at rates higher than predicted they actually thought we were far worse than we are today? The fuck?   Under the ""**What Americans think about Trump's performance**"" header it shows people are most approving of Trump's immigration policy. Trump invokes the Alien Enemies Act with no basis and uses it to deport both citizens and non-citizens to a death camp in another country while skipping due process and almost half the nation says ""well, that's not all that bad"".   And here's a real kick in the nuts for the United States. Among Republicans, Trump enjoys a 90% approval rating. Only 10% of Republicans think Trump is doing a bad job. Ignoring the courts, deportations of citizens without due process, gutting of America's institutions, selling off national parks for resources, the tariffs pulling us into a recession, attacks on education, his ridiculously under-qualified cabinet appointments, pump and dumping the economy, DOGE, threats to annex Canada and Greenland by military force, consolidation of power in the Executive branch, and on and on... none of that moves the needle for 90% of Republicans.

Bear with me‚Ä¶ it is because they have taken advantage of our alliance so far with predatory trade policies dumping their highly skilled and technologically advanced manufactured goods on our market.  These countries make aircraft, cars, semiconductors, electrical components ( such as transformers) and other goods that America wants to retain its manufacturing base in.  Who cares about consumer electronics or toys that China dumps on us? But of course Trump and his team are too dumb to realize this so they just apply blanket non-strategic tariffs that ultimately make Xi Jinping look like m f‚Äôing Robin Hood.",Dense_Badger_1064,2025-04-23T08:32:59,1

The New Deal era's steam went off when Reagan was elected twice in a landslide, promising to cut regulations. It hasn't recovered since-No politician has won by promising a ""New Deal"". The opposite is true in fact- they have won on promising to downsize the government.    Some parts of the establishment may be against the more leftist wing of the party is because they haven't won. It's all talk and very little game. The primary purpose of the party is to win elections in tough races and if you can't do that, you're a glorified twitch streamer.

"I think we also need to recognize how much the establishment (establishment dems and media) has fought actual leftists. Even in your example of Bernie Sanders, the DNC colluded against him to influence the vote and also constituents' perception of the primary. Now I won't say he would have won the primary without that, he may still have lost but I will say he polled better than Hillary against Trump.  Nancy Pelosi campaigned hard to keep AOC from getting an internal position in favor of an old guy with cancer.   Centrists align with capital interests to pour money into elections to defeat progressive primary challengers.   So it's a bit off to say that voters choose centrists over progressives when centrists do everything in their power to punch left and collude against them within the party structure, block appointments and campaigns of progressives using billionaire money to boot. The same money that fuels much of the media landscape that's owned by billionaires and that puts out billionaire aligned reporting.  Also I'll push back some on the idea that there's no support for New Deal era policies and that there's no event(s) that would push people towards that. See Trump for example. Trump didn't get elected because there's no appetite for massive change. After the last few decades of neo-lib gutting of the country and especially the 2008 crash, there has been a LOT of desire for big changes.   Obama got elected riding a change platform and the idea of massive healthcare reform. Trump certainly got elected because the Republican party finally couldn't contain the populist bent the electorate has taken.   We've seen Democrats do exceptionally poorly running these centrist candidates in recent elections in fact. Hillary lost. Joe Biden won by a thin margin in what logically should have been a blow out after the awful first Trump term. Kamala lost after the party forced her in and also when we once again ran a centrist against a populist.",PotatoRover,2025-04-23T10:29:14,2
"I would argue that the space for a new deal Democratic revival has more space to happen than you think.  The great depression was a lot of bad all at once, but everyone's been struggling for a long sustained period of time and it doesn't look to be letting up soon. The overall stable vibe of the American economy is getting worse and worse for the working class, and that prolonged stress is what allowed for Trumpism to arise in the first place. The people are hungry for change, so if we provide them a better left alternative that isn't how democrats have been operating there's a chance it could work.  Let's also not forget that Bernie was deliberately sabotaged by the DNC and Debbie Wasserman Schultz stepped down as a direct result to that leaking. The 2016 primary as a referendum on new deal left isn't a good point of reference.  In 2020 very few were really enthusiastic about Biden. His victory came down to a few things. Obama finally called on the other moderates to step down and endorse Biden which led their supporters to just kinda go ""fine, I guess?"" And Jim Clyburn handed him South Carolina. If that hadn't happened Super Tuesday could have done extremely differently. Then the pandemic hit, Bernie suspended his campaign, and the rest is history. This strikes me much less enthusiastic about Biden than some people like to suggest, it was more anti trump fervor at that point rather than ""yes, this is the guy I want and the direction I want the democratic party to go."" Before that Bernie had a plurality in the party among all candidates. Ffs, YANG GANG was more popular than Biden for a while (no offense to you out there).

"But those food companies will see their costs increase, too, will they not? Farmer's costs are going to increase, which will be passed on to the food companies.

And even if their costs don't increase as much as expected, the companies will do what companies do--they'll increase their prices anyway, since everyone else will be doing it and they can blame someone besides themselves. Just like how costs skyrocketed during covid, and then later, when the supply chain was pretty much back to normal, they kept those high prices.

">Even in your example of Bernie Sanders, the DNC colluded against him to influence the vote and also constituents' perception of the primary  It's more appropriate to say that the DNC generally pulled for Hillary than pushed against Sanders. It might sound meaningless to you, but it's has a huge impact. Pulling for Clinton meant that the field was less crowded- so all the anti Hillary Dems coalesced around Sanders. It wasn't necessarily a vote for Sanders but a vote against Clinton. It was shown by the 2020 primaries where the field was a bit more crowded that same voter might have voted for their first choice- say Warren. It is shown by the fact that in every single state Sanders apparantly lost support.   He polled better simply because the Republicans knew that he likely wasn't going to be the nominee and so didn't run their barrage against him. And I don't want to defame him here, but he has a lot of shit that If was spread- it would make the emails look like a nothingburger.  Also, early polls don't indicate much because people generally aren't tuned into politics enough as you or I. They only form opinions later.   >Centrists align with capital interests to pour money into elections to defeat progressive primary challengers.   If Democrats who are already to the left of the country can be convinced to vote for centrists ""because money"" what does it say about the progressives? How are progressives so feeble that they fail to get votes simply because the others outspend them? The election is a war. If centrist Dems can supposedly do it Republicans can do it too and that's bad news for those progressives.   Also you have provided ni evidence that in absence of that spending the progressives would win. And that's the crux of your argument.   >After the last few decades of neo-lib gutting of the country and especially the 2008 crash, there has been a LOT of desire for big changes.   Evidence, where? Apart from his isolationist stance the Trump agenda is Reagan's wet dream. You think the abolition of the Dept. of Ed. is new- it's a promise Reagan gave in the 80s. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is not as revolutionary as you portray. It's just an extension of Reaganite policies.   >Kamala lost after the party forced her in and also when we once again ran a centrist against a populist.  Apart from the fact that none of this is direct evidence for New Deal Democrats. And the very simple counter argument is look at the primary votes. Harris most likely lost because she was tied to Biden (she was the VP) and Biden's approvals were low because in his terms we saw highest YoY inflation since 1981 and near record numbers of illegal immigration.

">everyone's been struggling for a long sustained period of time and it doesn't look to be letting up soon.   *Everyone* in the US? And for how long? I don't think so, at least not since 2010. The second paragraph is a lot of talk with nothing substantial that you could point to. I sincerely don't understand what ""vibe"" here means. And please don't point to what Trump has done in the past 3 months- that's entirely self inflicted and the projections for 2025 were originally pretty good.   The MAGA element has always and always existed in the Republican party- even if the economy looked up for the workers, they will still exist. They got in more control of the party after the decimation under Bush. It basically killed anyone associated with him. Obama is not poison like Bush was- so Obama Dems still remain. Ted Cruz was probably more conservative than Trump and Rubio wasn't as charismatic. And still Trump couldn't even win the majority of the Republicans in his first primaries. At the start of his Presidency a third of the Republicans disapproved of him.   >Obama finally called on the other moderates to step down and endorse Biden which led their supporters to just kinda go ""fine, I guess?""  That was after Sanders had already endorsed him. By that point he was already the presumptive nominee. Obama didn't hand victory to Biden. Also, it's important to remember that Sanders actually underperformed in the primaries, even discounting South Carolina. Even if you argue that initially the democratic field was split- after March 5th it was essentially a 2 person race. There were 9 primaries after that and he underperformed in double digits and three states flipped against him that he had won 4 years earlier.   >it was more anti trump fervor at that point rather than ""yes, this is the guy I want and the direction I want the democratic party to go.""

"I would say that the DNC pulling for Hillary isn't really an argument against my idea and is just another example of pro centrist manipulation against progressives especially since Clinton kind of falls neatly into the camp of people that monied interests want and the first Clinton presidency was the time the Dems really started aligning with neo-liberalism.   Our entire society is based around money and our election apparatus is no different. Is it really a weird take to say that candidates that aren't supported by the party establishment itself and that are up against candidates with billionaire backing would face an immense uphill battle? Especially with what we know about the electorate. A sadly large number of people aren't very politically knowledgeable. They don't like Trump so they vote for the person with the (D) next to the name and that's as far as these people go so it's not that centrists are popular in the party, in fact these elections where candidates try to appear more moderate haven't gotten them victories. Hundreds of millions of dollars spent propping up pro business/status quo politicians is a hard hurdle to beat when so many vote on name recognition over policy.   I'm not saying Trump's actions are in line with actual anti establishment practices (you don't fill the government with billionaires if that's the case) but he campaigned on populism and feeding into people's anger at the current system. Dumb people that voted for him won't get the change they feel they need.   For evidence that people don't actually like the current centrist Democratic party. See it's approval rating currently. Those democrats that are angry at their party aren't angry that it's not centrist enough.  Also look at New Deal esque policies of the current era like universal healthcare. It has like 80% support from democratic voters and yet none of the establishment democrats support it. There's polling saying that a majority of Democratic voters want the party to fundamentally change directions. And a majority want it to be more progressive vs 18% saying more moderate from a realclearpolling article. We're also seeing huge number of people show up for leftwing Sanders/AOC rallies in a non election year.  She's tied to Biden because she refused to break from his centrism. Also kind of insane to say Harris is a leftist. If you don't support something like universal healthcare or even just a public option you're at best solidly in the center politically.",PotatoRover,2025-04-23T12:18:17,2

"Okay I'm clear now. So two things you might be misremembering or interpreting. The first is that the other democratic primary hopefuls did endorse Biden first in March of 2020 to consolidate their remaining bases around him. When shutdown began later that month, all momentum stopped, and Bernie endorsed Biden in April.  In regards to his performance during the primary you'll notice that the field was much more packed than in 2016. There was more nuance between policies that allowed folks to more directly pick and choose their preferred directions, which I actually think is a good thing. In 2016 there was essentially Hillary, Bernie, O'Malley, Webb, and Chaffee (spelling?). Chaffee got asterisk for support because it was kinder than zero after the debate (yikes) and Webb came off as... Odd.   So quickly it became Bernie, Hillary, and O'Malley. O'Malley simply did not gain momentum and then it was Bernie and Hillary, the rest is history.  Combined with the much larger amount of candidates and a global pandemic (and yes, Jim Clyburn did hand Biden SC, that much was even said at the time), Bernie ""underperforming"" does not indicate much that there's even less of a demand for further left policies (lots of which are very popular across the board). Do i think that absent all of the weirdness of both elections that Bernie would have definitely won? No, it'd be tight races, maybe nothing would have changed, but as they happened I wouldn't entirely measure how they were a rejection of his policies.   I'm not mentioning elections before that because the landscape is entirely different.   And no I did not mean ""everybody"", that was hyperbole on my part to mean ""a lot"" which you're right to call me out on so I appreciate that.  Sorry if my thoughts are scattered I have ADHD.",ImBatman5500,2025-04-23T11:06:03,2
One more point before I go is oh everything leading up to the election is hugely important not sure how you could reasonably suggest it isn't possible to have a huge battle that would affect the outcome of the general and shape the direction of debate for the whole country.,ImBatman5500,2025-04-23T10:45:30,1
">macroeconomic success of our economy not necessarily matching the lived experience of every day people.  I don't see that. Inflation matters to everyone, workers or big businesses.

"Income has not kept with with cost of living increase and inflation.   https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/101314/what-does-current-cost-living-compare-20-years-ago.asp  So rising wages alone do not show a whole picture of it cannot keep up with the cost of living. State minimum wages are only now *sometimes* catching up to the discourse of $15 an hour from 2016. It likely needs to be higher now.  That's interesting about multiple job holders, I would be curious to see the demographics and if the percentage has shifted, as that would give a clearer picture than an average.   Also we shouldn't include billionaires in the average income adjusted for inflation because they can throw off the averages just by being included and give us an inaccurate picture.

"Looking at the economic policy institute perhaps you and I have been looking at this wrong, as we were taking the phrase ""wage stagnation"" to mean literally zero growth which we can see is untrue here.  In another they did (which is also a decade out of date admittedly) we can see different charts that might highlight what I'm getting at here: [https://www.epi.org/publication/charting-wage-stagnation/](https://www.epi.org/publication/charting-wage-stagnation/)  While it's been growing in most places, the wealth disparity between the classes is also increasing, and that includes in their wages. The top paid are seeing the most benefit over time, while the middle class is relatively stable, and lower class seems to have actually gotten lower in some areas.  It's also true that wages have not increased with productivity, it's actually gone down, which is weird. It also looks like the gender gap increased for college grads, less places are offering healthcare with employment, CEO wages have skyrocketed compared to what their workers make. Looks like real minimum wage is down too.  It seems like we A. need to realize that stagnation in this case doesn't literally mean no growth, and B. need to see that the overall numbers (as in just measuring Real Wages vs Inflation over time) don't necessarily have the whole picture either. Lots of the issues I were highlighting can be seen here.",ImBatman5500,2025-04-23T12:56:50,2
