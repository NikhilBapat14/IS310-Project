"Why are we so unable to recognize and harness energy? Why do we need Democratic strategists and PACs to research and figure out how to activate a base?  Hmm if only there was a way a couple of people were able to go from city to city, red and blue alike, and consistently draw record crowds in an off year. Maybe we’d be able to see where the energy is.",TheSpiritsGotMe,2025-04-18T17:54:17,13

"Democrats have always been for the working class. That's pretty much the main component to being a liberal.  Helping.   Falls back to intelligence.  So dems need to litterally use the most basic 4th grade words to explain things.  That's what T-bag did.  We took away the big words and people felt more connected.  Understood.  If you start saying things like ""Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff"" instead of simply saying ""general"" you lose.",Jayrrock,2025-04-18T20:44:01,5

Universal health care. Raise the minimum wage. Protect unions. Bust up the monopolies. Tax the rich.  No insider trading by officials. No SuperPACS. No Citizens United. No gerrymandering.

Too much focus on niche civil rights issues and culture war. All that matters is creating a well educated and secure middle class to maintain the party. Do that and the rest will follow.,ClioEclipsed,2025-04-18T18:08:16,-3

"It will be just as daunting. Every time the pendulum swings and nothing happens, the voter base is more willing look towards extreme choice.  The DNC's task is beyond just gaining back the working classes faith. Trump won because so many people, have lost faith not just in the DNC, but in the system as a whole.  Sure, the DNC might win the next election.. Only to lose it the next because the DNC is only capable of delivering small marginal wins and not really change the major problems that pushed the electorate towards the right. We're at the point where eventually, the pendulum will not be allowed to swing the other way again. We're nearly there with Trump, if you believe most of reddit right now.  Sure, Trump will be worse, but him failing will not push people in the other direction. As we saw last election, it will only push people to become more apathetic towards the system at best, and hostile at worse. What needs to happen, is if the DNC wins next election, they need to desperately, even if it means using executive orders, make significant improvements to the system.  Whether it be complete healthcare form, complete tax overhaul to deal with wealth inequality, whatever, they need a big win that significantly improves the lives of the average American.  The biggest takeaway from the 2024 election, is that people want major change to the status quo.",Naticbee,2025-04-18T22:31:58,8

"Not enough.  100% truth, if Dems want to win back the working class vote it should start with not focusing on which bathrooms people should be able to use, or what team sports they can play.  in other words, the working class cares mostly about 1 thing:  food on the table, a roof over head, being able to pay bills on time, and a little cushion in the bank. I know, that is four things, but it is all about jobs and money.  What Dems really need to do is to simply deliver.  If they say they are going to do universal childcare or whatever, then do it.  If Republicans block then at least give the impression that Dems are rolling up their sleeves and working like mad dogs to make it happen.  To us, MTG looks like a clown.  But to MAGA, she looks like a fighter.  And that matters, a lot.",crucial_geek,2025-04-18T16:02:28,3

"The major take away from 2024 is that a large part of the electorate are highly misinformed. There is simply too much bull shit information out there. We live in a world where two completely different realities are coexisting simultaneously and it is tearing us apart.    Also, please don’t tell me that democrats need to move closer to the center or change our positions to appease Trump supporters.  We have been shifting to the right for decades. Democrats need to toughen up. We have the right platform.   Workers rights  Human rights  Equal rights  Healthcare  Environment   Social safety nets  Education   If younger generations are slipping through the cracks they are cracks created by conservative policies that have been slowly tearing this country down since the mid seventies. I’m 54 years old and my eyes have been open for a long time.  I’ve sat here and watched it happen so please don’t tell me how democrats need to change. We have tried playing nice for too damn long.

Dems worked like mad dogs to get Biden’s priorities done that were good for the working class and none of that mattered. Running on stuff and *trying* to do it won’t move the needle at all. People need to see results and they need to be immediate.,GeneralZex,2025-04-18T16:21:23,15
"*the working class cares mostly about 1 thing: food on the table, a roof over head, being able to pay bills on time, and a little cushion in the bank.*  If that were true Republicans wouldn't stand a chance. Donald Trump's support is largely about racism and sexism. MAGA is nothing more than a desire to return to a time when white men controlled everything, women and people of color knew their places, and the LGBTQ folks were invisible again.   Donald Trump hasn't done anything to materially benefit average Americans and neither has any Republican president in the last 50 years. They get white working class votes because they're on team ""let's go back to 1950.""",The_B_Wolf,2025-04-18T17:26:02,8
That is what the Republicans pretend are their most important things not what the Democrats say they are.   How are you going to get the Republicans to stop lying about those being the most important things for Democrats?  They’ll keep lying about it until it stops working.

I just got a lifetime ban from DailyKos for simply suggesting that girls who transitioned from boys after puberty should play on boys teams in strength-based sports. That is a very tiny carve-out and apparently their moderation team couldn't even handle just that. 2 or 3 short posts about that after being a member for over a decade. You cannot tell me that Democrats aren't obsessively focused on this issue to the point of creating massive backlash.,w4rma,2025-04-20T16:14:23,1

"Trump ultimately won because of his economic 'policy' that  claimed to lower egg prices on day 1.  Remember, a good amount of people were still talking about being in a recession 6 months ago and that it was Biden's fault.   Economics, the wallet, etc. are what wins and loses elections.    Dems have good policies but really suck at the delivery.  As in, a day late and a dollar short.  The Republican method is to claim that they will fix the thing come hell or high water.  Even if they don't, the appear confident, if not arrogant, and it is that confidence that wins votes. The average person doesn't care how, they just want it done.   For the first two years of Biden's Admin, Dems had the power to get shit done.  Sure, they got some things done, but then slept on the rest.  Ultimately they had four years to ensure this shit that we are dealing with today would never happen, but yeah ... don't blame the SCOTUS, because they gave Biden immunity, too, you know.  But instead of using that, instead of going apeshit on the kooks, they took the business as usual, we can weather the storm but you know, the Sun will come out tomorrow approach.    The racism and sexism is a part of the MAGA appeal, but it is mostly based on grievance politics and getting even.  Largely, though, it is because they can say what they want and no one is going to yell at them for it.  I mean, go into a group of libs or progressives and say that you are still not sure where you stand on the trans athlete thing and see how it goes.   What Trump is not doing is apparent to everyone.  For MAGA, though, the idea is that has barely been 3 months and to give it time.",crucial_geek,2025-04-18T18:38:29,-2
