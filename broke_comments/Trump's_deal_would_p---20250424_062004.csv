"To find the answer to your questions, you should probably start to learn about who Putin is as a person, his history. There are many media sources (newspaper, books, videos) that cover his personality type and what he‚Äôs known for.   To save you some time: he‚Äôs one of the best manipulators on the world stage. He has inserted destructive politics into governments throughout the world by hijacking conservative ideology and turning people against their own interests, as well as their own countrymen. If you remember the tea party movement in the US, this was the first real test, the beginning of the current form of Russian powered propaganda which has been having such massive success across the world.  Such a master manipulator would (1) never interrupt an enemy while they make a mistake. This refers to Trumps deconstruction of NATO and world alliances during his first term. If he acts while the process is still ongoing, the threat becomes real and everyone could then rally around the threat.  Such a master manipulator would (2) be fully aware of how his actions would play on the politics of any related nation, especially the US. As I mentioned above with his hijacking‚Äôs of rightwing political ideology throughout the world, such a master manipulator (3) would do everything in his power to make the opposing party look weak and unelectable in the country which is his biggest adversary.
