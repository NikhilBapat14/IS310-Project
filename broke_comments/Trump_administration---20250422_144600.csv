But no changes on orange face dyes,Nice-Lakes,2025-04-22T14:47:30,38
"> The Trump administration appears poised to take action on a broader set of petroleum-based synthetic dyes that are used to make food and beverages brightly colored and more appealing to consumers.  I imagine a brown envelope, maybe more than one, is making its way to Trump's grubby little fingers already, and this will be quietly dropped without fanfare shortly afterwards.",DaveChild,2025-04-22T15:03:29,23

"Understood, but there are a few peer-reviewed studies that state there could potentially be a link between consumption of FD&C colorings and attention disorders in children in vitro.   Products containing some dyes sold in the EU and the UK have a warning label on them, as seen on the U.S. manufactured product (what I am guessing is jello pudding) sold in the UK:  [https://imgur.com/a/t2H3Jat](https://imgur.com/a/t2H3Jat)",walkallover1991,2025-04-22T15:43:24,0
"Depends on whether the food manufacturer already exports to the EU or any other polity that bans artificial dyes.  If EU spec recipes already exist, then not long.  If they don't, probably some months, and there could be impact to shelf life if it's found that certain foods' natural dyes don't hold up as long as their artificial counterparts.  I would normally anticipate that a large shake-up like this would be more like a ""remove all artificial dyes by 2029"" not ""with immediate effect""... but this is the Trump admin we're talking about so who the fuck knows.     \~Food packaging industry business analyst.",ISOaVoidtoScreamInto,2025-04-22T15:22:17,2

Just because these people are terrible in every possible way and doing likely irrepairable harm let's not take a short moment to acknowledge this is not a terrible thing.  Sure, it's probably a distraction, but gift horse and all.  The EU has banned, or applies warnings to, the vast majority of these dyes years ago.

"https://time.com/7210717/food-additives-us-fda-banned-europe/  >The U.S. has a very different approach to regulating additives than many other countries, says Thomas Galligan, principal scientist for food additives at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group.  >“The E.U. says that if they can’t dismiss the possibility of harm, they can’t find an additive safe,” Galligan says. In the U.S., the bar is much lower; companies can add new ingredients to their foods without even informing the FDA. “In the U.S., it feels like the FDA is waiting to act until harm is definitely proven,” says Galligan.  Let's wait until they truly harm people before we do anything.  Yeah, that sounds like a good plan.  The absence of study data is not comforting when there haven't truly been extensive studies.  It's like the morons who said that Covid didn't exist if we didn't report cases.  Maybe wait to add chemicals to food until we **know** it's safe rather than add it and then try to determine later if it was safe to add?  It's just sad to me that we are at a point in this country where people are defending CONSUMING **petroleum based chemicals** as a good thing simply because it makes their favourite snack foods all bright and colourful.  What is wrong with you people?  PS -  > Artificial dies are not known to be harmful.  It's ""dyes"" dipshit.  But, funny enough, eat enough and there's a chance you might, ""dies.""  We don't really know because we haven't really studied that.  Go eat some more colourful Trix or something.  Maybe we can find out.",Hypothesising_Null,2025-04-23T15:54:50,1
