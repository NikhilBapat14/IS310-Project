"> Corporate parent Paramount and its controlling owner, Shari Redstone, are seeking the approval of federal regulators to sell it to the son of Oracle founder Larry Ellison. The billionaire software mogul is a friend of Trump who visited the president at the White House earlier this year.  >  Orban or Erdogan playbook. Their buddy oligarchs bought practically all the press in their respective countries.",Just-Sale-7015,2025-04-22T18:21:12,45
"Well, I applaud the guy for standing up for the show - quitting means that he will probably be replaced by a MAGA “Yes Man” type of person, or at least someone who isn’t smart enough to know he’s being played by Trump’s Gobbles-Media—Circus",animalslover4569,2025-04-22T18:10:04,23
"I really wish Colbert would say “fuck this” and start his own/use his own production and distribution company. If CBS is going to cave for their actual news, it’s likely they’ve already pushed Colbert to tone it down.",TilISlide,2025-04-22T18:28:04,14

"Yes just like Orban did in Hungary. I tend to think we have the checks and balances to keep Authoritarianism in check but once the Press starts to cave, I get nervous.",stimber,2025-04-22T18:28:37,15

"That's the money paragraph. I just watched a video by Jake Tapper on this. CBS/Paramount needs the approval of the FCC for the merger. Trump's appointee heads the FCC. Shari Redstone stands to gain many millions if the sale goes through. She doesn't GAF for journalistic integrity. Scott Pelley said in the linked article that Owens had no choice, he was forced out. Goodbye, 60 minutes and all they've stood for in the last 50 years.",kassandra8286,2025-04-23T10:47:01,3

"Whether he stays or goes, the corporation is apparently calling the shots, so what purpose does he serve by staying -- other than providing cover or legitimacy to the corporation's manipulation of the program?  If he stays while the fascists and corporate people have their way with the program, existing viewers may be less wary of the subtle changes and be more easily manipulated.  On the other hand, given how ham-handed MAGA lackeys tend to be, his replacement would likely produce such a shitshow that regular viewers would be replaced by witless fools who've already bought into the lies -- leaving nothing gained for Team Fascism.   If only for his reputation and mental health, I still think he made the correct decision",Ex-maven,2025-04-22T20:12:28,9
"The resistance is growing.   Fascists always lose in the end. But EVERYONE must stand up, even if it's just to say to a neighbor with whom you've previously held your tongue, ""I don't agree with you. The constitution is what makes us great, and this administration is shitting on it. Our country will die if we allow this republican administration to continue.""  It's also important to remember that THIS ISN'T JUST TRUMP. It IS Republican fascism. The republican congress, coequal to the executive under the constitution, has thus far ceded their power to the executive. That means they support fascism and they must go. As must do-nothing dems like Hakeem Jeffries, Nancy Pelosi, and Chuck Schumer.",BlatantFalsehood,2025-04-23T06:48:40,4
