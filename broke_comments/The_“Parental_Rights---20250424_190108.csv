"My feeling is this case will be decided either 6 to 3 or possibly 5 to 4 for the right wing.

"We all know SCOTUS is going to rule in favor of the bigots. The bigger question is what standard will they set? Will they allow parents to request alternative materials for anything (for example, a nonwhite character showing up in a children's book)? If so, then this will cause chaos as a practical matter to accommodate every parent on every request. Will they set an arbitrary standard saying LGBTQ bad? If so, then the SCOTUS has just set in stone that anti-LGBTQ beliefs will be given special deference by the government.",JesterOfEmptiness,2025-04-24T22:11:22,1
"Just curious‚Ä¶are the republicans planning on a nationwide ban of rap/hip hop music as well, on all platforms?   Why is a book about a kid with two moms offensive but lyrics about shooting at random people or selling drugs or murdering women are just fine? I‚Äôm not okay with my kid hearing that shit coming from sound systems every time we go for a walk. How come the right wing isn‚Äôt taking this on?  Is it not as physically intimidating to harass gay men at Pride than it is to get in some rappers face at a hip hop show?   Why are right wingers too hypocritical to do the scary stuff and picket a rap concert or get in some rappers face? They‚Äôre fine doing these things to gay men at our events.

"I understand that not all Anti-LGBTQ sentiments are ginned up by fascists, but clearly organizations like the ironically named '[Moms For Liberty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moms_for_Liberty)' are funded by those supporting fascism.   While the leaders of 'Moms for Liberty' have stated that their organization is non-partisan and grounded in conservative values.  In fact all three founders 'Moms for Liberty' are registered Republicans, and the organization has ties to the Republican Party.  'Moms for Liberty' is also affiliated with the Proud Boys, a far right neo-fascist organization.  Pretty clearly this Anti-LGBTQ organization is being funded by fascists, and is serving the interests of fascists who wish to control our nation's educational system.  The efforts of 'Moms for Liberty' can not be fully appreciated without being aware of who is behind them and seeing how their efforts coincide with other similar efforts of fascists to split the American people into opposing factions, unable to combine or cooperate in opposition to the on going fascist take over of our country.  Fascists have been trying to take over the U.S. almost since the inception of Fascism.  In 1933 Fascists plotted to overthrow the U.S. government and replace the President with a Dictator.  [The Business Plot (1933)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Plot)  >""When and if fascism comes to America it will not be labeled 'made in Germany'; it will not be marked with a swastika; it will not even be called fascism; it will be called, of course, 'Americanism.'"" - Halford E. Luccock (1938)  >The symptoms of fascist thinking are colored by environment and adapted to immediate circumstances. But always and everywhere they can be identified by their appeal to prejudice and by the desire to play upon the fears and vanities of different groups in order to gain power. It is no coincidence that the growth of modern tyrants has in every case been heralded by the growth of prejudice. It may be shocking to some people in this country to realize that, without meaning to do so, they hold views in common with Hitler when they preach discrimination against other religious, racial or economic groups. Likewise, many people whose patriotism is their proudest boast play Hitler's game by retailing distrust of our Allies and by giving currency to snide suspicions without foundation in fact.  >The American Fascists are most easily recognized by their deliberate perversion of truth and fact. Their newspapers and propaganda carefully cultivate every fissure of disunity, every crack in the common front against fascism. They use every opportunity to impugn democracy. They use isolationism as a slogan to conceal their own selfish imperialism.  >They cultivate hate and distrust [of allies]. They claim to be super-patriots, but they would destroy every liberty guaranteed by the Constitution. They demand free enterprise, but are the spokesmen for monopoly and vested interest. Their final objective toward which all their deceit is directed is to capture political power so that, using the power of the State and the power of the market simultaneously they may keep the common man in eternal subjection. - Henry A. Wallace, Vice President, USA, 1944.

"I hate Trump like you all here but it's parents right to rise their kids in whatever ideology/faith etc. they want.  Nor schools, nor Scouts etc. should push that on children, no matter if it's right/left, LGBTQ or Christianity - that's private matter of parents, hausehold and family. People should just mind their own business.  Schools/SCOUTS should focus on teaching facts, science, factual skills etc. Rest should stay at home.

"Willing to take some time here because I believe you have good intentions.   1. Some very religious parents would argue biology, physics, chemistry, etc is theology based because they don‚Äôt believe in evolution. Should kids be removed from those?  2. LGBTQ people isn‚Äôt a theology like religion is. To an extent, people can‚Äôt choose what they believe. I get that. But being lgbtq is so inherent to a persons identity. That‚Äôs something they CANT choose.   So the idea of having a book where a kid has two moms is the exact same is having a book with a kid whose parents are interracial. It just shows kids ‚Äúhey, this exists and is okay‚Äù.   Take Mormonism for example, where interracial marriage is not a sin anymore, but is still scrutinized. Would it be okay for a parent to take their kid out of a classroom of a book that mentions interracial marriage because of their religion?   The further we allow religion to seep into the classroom, the more things will be banned. There was a whole boom of Harry Potter books being demonized by very religious people. Should we remove those from a classroom as well?   I‚Äôm just trying to prove that this is a scary slope, and it‚Äôs not right for parents to remove their children from ideas and people that exist. It‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre having children think about their sexuality. It‚Äôs just showing that people can love others in a way that isn‚Äôt just straight.",Scott_does_art,2025-04-24T20:06:54,1

But being lgbtq is so inherent to a persons identity. That‚Äôs something they CANT choose.   To your first point: they could argue but physics, biology and chemistry is science based. They have right to believe there is a guy with beard in heaven, but science materials/papers are scientific facts. That's it. They have right to disagree, right to not believe, but science is science and school is place for science. Church for theology. If they don't like science, they can send their kid to chruch schools or something (you have stuff like that in US I think).  To your second point: it is ideology as they believe there is more than two genders for example, while from science perspective, chromosomes are the ones that biologically define your gender. It's DNA package, you can't change that. Ignoring it won't make it go away. It's fact. Now again, like above, you have right to identify as you want, believe what you want, live as you want.   In both cases live as you want and don't try to tell others how they should live.  But school in both cases is for science and factually, scientific proven subjects.   Rest should stay in home/family as I don't really care what you believe in home. But my kid in school is going there to learn math or chemistry, not X or Y believes of X or Y group of people.   I belive everyone can cooexist as long as they mind their business. Problem starts when either side tries to sell their believes are ""right"" and say others are ""wrong"".   Obviously, everyone are equal in eyes of law and I stand behind that too. Nobody should be discriminated or promoted/favored based on anything that's not his actions/metrics in the eye of the law or society.",Sol0botmate,2025-04-24T20:35:52,1
"School is not from depicions of couples in general. I was in school like everyone esle and I never seen it. It only comes in biology (and not as ""couple"" since that's not subject of lessons) becasue biology teaches about procreation, which obviously in human case requires showing female and male so teens can learn how biological mechanism of procreation works. It's just science. And in my books they didn't even have skin colors, they were see-through pictures of human bodies with muscles/organs etc. Everything else in school had nothing to do with that.",Sol0botmate,2025-04-24T20:42:26,1

"> You don't believe this. You're intentionally ignoring obvious shit like the stuff I described above.  I do, cause I went to school and I don't consider teachers having their spouse on their desk as same as whole book that designed to teach about certain kinds of love/couples/sexuality etc.  That's not what school is for. And such books do not existed in all my years of school or you want to tell me that story about Paris and Helena is meant to promote straight couples instead of just being a story about love, tragedy and war. These were the books that I had in school and nobody treated that as any sort of sexual propaganda. They were just books about subjects important for history or literature.   You are adding nonexistent context where it was never there.  > Do you accept that gay people are born gay? Do you accept that gayness has been exhibited in virtually every animal species?  Of course I do. I support gay marriages and obviously people are born gay, you can't become a gay. And yes, homosexuality happens among other animals. I never said that I don't believe anything of that.  But school is for science, not teaching kids about sex life or religion. That's it.  > The kindergarten section is FULL of books like ""How to Go Potty"" with a mom and a dad in them - and that's fine, but two moms is a problem?  You realize it has nothing to do with promoting anything? It's just that these books are old (mostly old simple child stories) and show the most common thing these kids can relate to. But it doesn't teach that this is the only good thing or that gay is not good. Its just a book about something else. Only 9.3% of USA population identifies as LGBTQ. And it's much less is other countries. Obviously kids will naturally see way more of hetero things around since that's 90-95% of humanity since that's default how we are genetically programmed to procreate.  But there is big difference in intention. Books you mentioned in kingergarden has no intention of sexually educating kids in KINGERGARTEN. Nobody ever wrote them with that in mind. That's just false propaganda (which leads us to ideology). It's just stories about stuff (like Snow White) that happens to be hetero since that always will be default, cause you know - spieces need to have off springs and 95% of humanity will be like that since as you said - you are born gay, you don't become one.   But putting there books about gay couples has different goal - to teach such little kids about sexuality. It has no place in school, especially in kindergarten. Leave at home with parents. Same as religion. Just let kids be kids and learn important stuff and leave trying to shape them into what you personally believe at home. That's it.",Sol0botmate,2025-04-24T21:47:41,1

"If there are people like that, then the are bad people and I will defend you from that as all humans that uhold law and are good to others deserve to be trated equally.   However, trying to force for example gayness into schools will only make you more enemies since 90-95% of humanity will always be straight since that's genetic default and % of gay people in society will always be the same since they don't prolong their genetic code due to being unable to have offsprings. It's a simple math/statistic. They will always be minority so they need to also act with more care. It mind sound unpleasant, but that's how it is, it's hard truth.  I will always support gay people, gay marriages and ability of gay people to just walk around and be in love and not be bothered. However, you have to admit that some take it to extreme, trying to force stuff into school where vast majority has nothing to do with it or making parades in wierd costumes or being obnoxious about their sexuality in public which only adds to wrong stereotypes and doesn't help.  I know it's hard subject and people are assholes, but both sides need to make efforts towards middle of the road. Extremes from both sides will only lead to more animosity.

"> Equal rights. Equal. Equal.  Yes, I already said that I want everyone to be equal in eyes of law. Where does law discriminate gay people in your country? For example in mine gay marriages are still not legal, but many of us fight for it but there is a lot of christians that oppose it so it's hard to do. And I agree that it should be changed.  However, books in kindergarten or school have nothing to do with law, right and equal rights and constitution. That's not something law regulates. At least not in my country, nor probably in any EU country. Once law (so goverement) forces certain ideas to be taught in schools instead of science - that's how you start to get into totalitarian state, as that's what they do - put ideology into kids since they are vulnerable to propaganda.
