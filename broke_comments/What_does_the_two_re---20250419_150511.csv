"The two decisions you refer to are limited to pausing actions that would likely lead to irremediable harm. They maybe don't demonstrate much decisive about the Alien Enemies Act itself, other than that the executive at this point shouldn't be able to simply label anyone it wants as an ""alien enemy"" without some sort of review. It seems like if there were to be any reasonable use of the Alien Enemies Act, then who constitutes an ""alien enemy"" would have to be so transparently obvious that most reasonable people would agree on it (as a hypothetical example, if the US and Russia declared war on each other, expelling members of the Russian military or government currently in the US), and the executive could have a free hand without the courts reviewing each individual case.   However, because right now they're saying that there needs to be due process for individuals, it implies that most of the Supreme Court Justices, like most sane people in the United States, understand that that what Trump is doing is a completely inappropriate, feckless use of the Alien Enemies Act and that this is a law that probably has no business being applied in the modern era under any circumstances, let alone when the US isn't even at war. However, because the decisions don't actually say this, they also show that the majority of the Supreme Court is not eager to skip ahead to a direct showdown with a president who doesn't respect rule of law, the US separation of powers, or the basic agreed upon meanings of words, and whose mental state may or may not have tipped over into complete psychosis.",NoAttitude1000,2025-04-19T16:30:48,14
"Gross misapplication of AEA, there is no invasion, no systematic effort sponsored by a foreign government.",[deleted],2025-04-19T15:13:58,46
"On another note: I wonder why the focus seems to be on Tren De Agua and MS-13 and not Mexican Cartels? I would argue the cartels are causing way more issues than street gangs like MS-13 or Tren De Agua. They are committing mass murders and control the fentanyl trade, yet I haven’t heard of any members being sent to CECOT. I have a suspicion that El Salvador is unwilling to take cartel members as they do not want to deal with any potential retaliation from the cartels. Which, if true, begs the question of how effective this plan is in the first place.",JarvisProudfeather,2025-04-20T00:21:14,9
"These decisions aren't addressing the (mis)use of this law.    If Abrego Garcia is not guilty of anything violent as it appears, then he may end being returned to the US and released without the merits of the Alien Enemies Act being considered.  His lawyers will focus on getting him home and filing a subsequent civil case for damages, not on addressing this particular law.  This law will likely be assessed, but with a different case.  One would hope that a district court rules that the law cannot be applied and that decision is ultimately allowed to stand by the Supreme Court.",I405CA,2025-04-19T19:50:02,8
"All it demonstrates is that Trump needs a terrorist attack, war, or other crisis of an inimical nature. Expect one of the above within the next 12 months. This is standard dictator stuff.",Gordon_Goosegonorth,2025-04-19T20:24:50,25
"Thomas and Alito really want to make Trump a king, it’s disgusting. What does Trump have to do for them to do against him?",Titan7771,2025-04-19T15:27:53,30
"The injunctions don't tell us much yet outside of the court actually taking the threat that Trump may, in fact, attempt to violate and ignore their orders on the matter seriously.  It's quite clear to me that the Trump administration isn't taking the previous order seriously in terms of a substantive habeus issue.    I don't believe *anyone* has made a clear-cut ruling on the AEA's applicability itself, and I think the arguments about its inapplicability here are stronger than the Trump team's claims that the assertion of TdA and Venezuela being one in the same isn't justicable. I worry a bit that case law is on Trump's side here in some regards, even if the straight language of the statute is not.  (As an aside, it's interesting to watch the people who think originalist thinking on the law is absolutely awful suddenly looking at the clear letter of the law as the guiding principle, and equally interesting to see people like Alito and Thomas give the appearance of deferring to the executive (although Alito's dissent on last night's order hasn't landed yet.))",ClockOfTheLongNow,2025-04-19T16:06:58,5
That trumps disregard for due process is the core issue here.  If he clears that up then they are likely to allow it.  But him thumbing his nose at the founding principle of this country is unacceptable,Wermys,2025-04-19T17:02:21,4
"All it says is ""Don't deport this group of Venezuelans or any similar detainees without due process (using the Alien Enemies Act), until we can decide who exactly it can be used on.",Cartagraph,2025-04-19T19:16:12,2
"Yeah, I know we all want to follow the Constitution and whatnot, so they will use that against this statement I am going to make.   The AEA was created in 1798, with very explicit guidelines, none of which apply to this bullshit.",Elite_Italian,2025-04-20T04:51:29,2
It shows that Supreme Court is not independent. Thus the USA is no longer a democracy.   That the judges are politically appointed in the first place is suspect.,povlhp,2025-04-20T03:51:49,0

They did not use the Aliens Enemies Act to deport him.  They argued that they used the INA in the court filings.,Present-Pen-5486,2025-04-22T18:21:41,1
The exact play book that Netanyahu did. He allowed the terrorist attack to happen so he would stay in power. We all knew he was about to be forced out of power for corruption.,echoshadow5,2025-04-20T00:45:30,11
