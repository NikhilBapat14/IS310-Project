Why kill youre entire career over something so dumb. We need to do a study on why leftist and liberals fall so hard for media doom panic. It's incredible. Greatest propaganda since ww2.,huntinggolfer,2025-04-21T19:17:22,52
"You know for all the talk of insurrection and so forth, these people are basically trying to foment a coup.  They need to be dealt with in the harshest possible terms.  When you‚Äôre an officer in the military, you don‚Äôt have the luxury of throwing a temper tantrum or doing shit like this.  Do everything possible under the UCMJ to drum her out and make an example of what happens when you think you‚Äôre bigger than the commander in chief that the majority of the country voted for.",RazorSlaked,2025-04-21T18:34:10,63

"Does anyone here doubt that the individuals being removed from positions of authority as a consequence of their own blatantly politically-motivated actions, could conceivably refuse to obey even a lawful order if it came from Trump?",Shadeylark,2025-04-22T06:56:00,-1

Honestly it‚Äôs a good point. To think that this person could be responsible for suspending someone from service for not passing fitness standards. Seriously?,ILikestoshare,2025-04-21T20:10:34,24
"Yeah I'm old but have a clear memory of when the Army's enlisted promotion boards could/would provide certain minority soldiers extra points towards promotions. It really was a bad idea. Much later an organization that I was part of had to ""encourage"" someone who had benefited from that system to retire.

"This.  There's a lot of flaired people on this sub, who at least claim to be veterans, who do a ton of Hegseth hating.    Things are different in the military in many ways.  I have no idea what these are as I'm not military, but it would make sense that if you can't execute the POTUS vision, then maybe the military isn't the right place for you.",Texas103,2025-04-22T01:23:58,-2
"But for real though‚Ä¶ her uniform says she managed to serve an entire career during 20 years of two wars, get promoted to full bird, become a garrison commander‚Ä¶ and never deploy in support of a combat operation?  A real POS",nostaticzone,2025-04-22T07:08:05,16
