"Isn't it crazy how the right truly believes immigrants don't deserve due process , even though its in the constitution   But trump..who was given due process, his hearings were viewed as constitutional over reach",swiftfoot_hiker,2025-04-23T16:45:31,86
"Um, how do you know they're undocumented without due process? ""He LOOKS illegal to me...""",tenebre,2025-04-23T16:50:16,26
"Russian agent working to destroy the country, who has had the extreme benefit of the doubt in numerous criminal trials against him, has a real problem with brown people getting a shred of judicial oversight that might prevent them from being ripped from their families and buried in an unmarked Central American jungle mass grave.",RealGianath,2025-04-23T16:50:45,16
The thing is that he isn’t actually deporting them. He is shipping them to a fucking prison in a country they’re likely not from instead of back to their actual countries of origin. What he is doing is trafficking people and imprisoning them without a trial in spite of the constitution demanding it at minimum.,Shiplord13,2025-04-23T17:17:56,7
We did trials for the 9/11 conspirators. I think some people that may or may not be undocumented deserve trials.,Dependent_Hunt_6433,2025-04-23T17:22:30,7

Why hasn't the Aliens Enemy Act haven't been repealed? It wrongly put Japanese Americans into internment camps for crying out loud.... now its being used by the Trump to do this.,wizgset27,2025-04-23T16:54:11,4

"Dude, it is evident, you do not understand your own Constitution/Country. Do you realize you want America to be communist?  Because your Constitution doesn't suit you anymore?

They don’t believe criminals should get due process.   Due process should only be for people who aren’t accused of a crime.   And Republicans.   I think that last part goes without saying.,specqq,2025-04-23T16:52:52,24
Just trying to figure out how they decide who deserves due process if there is no due process. They are both evil and absolute witless morons.,sylbug,2025-04-23T16:56:22,11
"They are so simple.   They don’t have the intellectual capacity to deduce that if the government decides certain people shouldn’t be granted due process, then due process isn’t a right for anybody.   Their hatred of brown people is far stronger than their capacity to sense danger or even their own self-preservation.",SuperLuigiUnited,2025-04-23T17:11:56,7
"Because most Trump supporters have the equivalent of an 8th grade education, they are easily manipulated and easily conned by the long known ""Don The Con""  They may be hard working, law abiding American citizens, but because they hated school they only slid by, learning little abought what actually made America great.",girfrann,2025-04-23T17:19:14,5
This is the point. To create so much confusion that you can’t figure out who is what/where and give up. Then when people disappear it’s just commonplace and the system is so overwhelmed it will be impossible to fix. This is exactly what they did to all those kids separated from their parents.,myfakesecretaccount,2025-04-23T16:54:25,15
Came here to say this! And to add that undocumented doesn’t mean illegal. Seeking asylum is legal but they aren’t documented initially.,HowAmINotMySelfie,2025-04-24T07:52:52,2
Yup.  Keep saying it. In relation to Trump it should be part of every comment online and statement in the real weird.,User-Name-8675309,2025-04-23T16:51:58,5

"This is the immigration practice and factually correct. As far as the current practices of this administration, since they’re removing people to not only incarceration but to incarceration in a foreign operated prison, out of the reach of the binding US Constitution, they are entitled to a trial.",RedditReader4031,2025-04-23T17:20:05,6
"Yup, he's playing in the muddy waters between what's allowed (we don't have resources for a full blown trial for every deportee, nor are they owed one) and what he's actually doing (not so much as a hearing, no due process at all).  And since 90% of the top comments here don't make any distinction between the two, it works.  To ""the middle""...who are largely uninformed...we can wind up sounding like the unreasonable side expecting full blown jury trials for the *millions* of undocumented immigrants before they can be removed.  Which is absurd on its face.  Trump's statement as laid out in the headline is *correct.*  And then lost in the shuffle of this entire conversation is the fact that we aren't simply deporting people, we are delivering them to custody of a (for most) third-nation prison that doesn't meet any 8th amendment standards.",Relevant-Bag7531,2025-04-23T20:36:57,1
"Trump was and is a criminal, the problem is that republicans don't believe he did anything wrong , believe that its all a Dem plot and refuse to read any of his indictments   It's mind-blowing that they truly believe that he's exempt from the law",swiftfoot_hiker,2025-04-23T17:00:58,10

"""Due process should only be for people who aren’t accused of a crime.""  Their logic really is this fucked. Wait until the days that a cop just thinks you committed a crime, then it means you did.

What possible specific instance are there. The constitution is the highest law in the land and due process is guaranteed in it.   You can't just imprison people or deport them without due process.,wizgset27,2025-04-23T17:11:47,2

"Its already that now, the governments deemed anyone who participated in or supported a protest/publication for Gaza as a terrorist and so a criminal and therefore no due process.  Next it'll be a minority like Trans people and it'll just keep expanding.",XXLpeanuts,2025-04-24T11:37:50,1
