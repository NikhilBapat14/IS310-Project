"A federal judge Thursday issued a [preliminary injunction](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25914812-04242025/) halting some provisions of the sweeping [executive order on elections](https://www.votebeat.org/2025/03/25/trump-executive-order-elections-mail-ballots-proof-of-citizenship/) President Donald Trump issued in March.  The injunction blocks his direction to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission to take steps to require documented proof of citizenship from people registering to vote, and a provision requiring federal voter registration agencies to “assess” the citizenship of individuals who receive public assistance before providing them a voter registration form.  “Our Constitution entrusts Congress and the States — not the President — with the authority to regulate federal elections,” Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly wrote in a [120-page opinion](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25914624-kollar/).  Citing deliberations among the original framers of the Constitution, she wrote: “Executive regulatory authority over federal elections does not appear to have crossed the Framers’ minds.”",votebeat,2025-04-24T15:08:59,6
It's funny how liberals will cheer this stuff on but had a meltdown and called to pack the court when they would block Biden actions. You can't just support the courts when it's convenient.,ghoster_2toaster,2025-04-24T15:10:33,-40
It’s funny how MAGAs see giving an authoritarian president power over who gets to vote as being the same as forgiving student loan debt.,Plan-of-8track,2025-04-24T15:33:20,1
 If a liberal wanted executive authority on elections you’d be breaking down the doors of the capital again like complete savages. But Trump gets a free pass? Y’all’s brains are broken.,alk_adio_ost,2025-04-24T15:42:35,1

Nope. Not in the slightest actually.,ghoster_2toaster,2025-04-24T15:14:02,1
I would argue they are different mainly because of the court systems. This is federal vs the loan forgiveness was escalated to the Supreme Court. Which Amy questioned the legitimacy of the case brought against them. It would seem the legitimacy should’ve been addressed first of it.   In this case the DOJ is arguing the legitimacy of this lawsuit bc they say the burden of proof of damages hasn’t happened yet. They are not debunking the damages just saying it happened yet but in the loan forgiveness the burden of proof of damages also hadn’t happened yet but was also debunked as incorrect data and questioned by personnel at the company’s the states used to file the lawsuit.   I guess there is also the difference of the groups who filed this lawsuit compared to the states filing the lawsuit against the loan forgiveness  (Not a lawyer so may be wrong but that’s my interpretation),drishaj,2025-04-24T17:06:55,1
