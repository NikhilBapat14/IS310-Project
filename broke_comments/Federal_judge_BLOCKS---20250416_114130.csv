"No no no. The Democratsâ€™ twisted ideology aligns with science, which aligns with free speech (?), noâ€¦you got me all confused. Speech isnâ€™t Free, yeah, something like that, unless you align with science, or somethingâ€¦.",dhw1015,2025-04-16T13:47:26,23
"Speech that might be ""capable of conveying such a message [of demeaning or harrassing language]"" is banned, but ""from the river to the sea"" is totally fine.  Great comparison too because they're both at school or school-related events.    The video of the original incident is really infuriating.  The school had the cops tell the parents to leave, and the cops were saying there's no free speech, this is a private property.  Like I'm sorry?  Soccer fields are usually either at schools, or public parks.  Either way, the school district controls the fields, since the district trespassed the parents.  Those are taxpayer-funded public properties.",JerseyKeebs,2025-04-16T14:35:14,4
