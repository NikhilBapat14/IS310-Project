"This guy legit defunds the police. Where’s the conservative outrage?   The whole “defund the police” movement was improperly named anyway, it was really about funding the police with more assets and more options for de-escalating. But this here is straight just taking money from them. Don’t expect a single peep from the right though. They actually stand for nothing but hate. He’s already done the same for firefighters.   Conservatives, wake up",Green_Tomato_7444,2025-04-24T19:55:53,1
"Was about to say it’s a pretty based ACAB move, but of course it’s all grants to assist victims being slashed:  “Targeted programs on a partial list seen by Reuters included: grants that supported crime victims, including for transgender victims; hotlines used by crime victims; grants to fight human trafficking that have gone to organizations working with immigrants; programs to curb juvenile delinquency and safeguard incarcerated youth; and funding for state-run hate-crime reporting.”",codyashi_maru,2025-04-24T20:15:29,1

"*heavy lisp* Well, you see, it's not ""defunding"" the police.  It is reducing the overhead that they use and better allocating the fund.  The DEMONCRATS wanted to take away all their firearms and give them pool noodles!  I saw it on FOX NEWS!",ERedfieldh,2025-04-24T19:41:27,1

Yeah I wanted to join in on the Defund the Police jokes but the police are not the ones who will be negatively impacted by this at all.,filthysize,2025-04-24T22:00:41,1
