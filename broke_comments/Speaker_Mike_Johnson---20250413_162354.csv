The top tax rate hike should be raised or at least changed to account for social security being currently not solvent imo.,Derp2638,2025-04-13T16:33:37,191
"If this gets trotted out there, I think we’ll officially be in jump the shark territory with this administration. This is an absurd and patently Marxist position, quite the opposite of anything remotely conservative.",deadzip10,2025-04-14T07:02:27,1

I don't see how it's fair to attack someone more than another person because they make more money.,BossJackson222,2025-04-13T20:48:05,-24
Higher income tax for lower corp tax is probably good. Better than current. Corp tax should be 0. Whats the point? Its just passed on in prices.,Negative-Negativity,2025-04-13T17:26:35,-50

Libertarian advocating for higher taxes?,dunkeater,2025-04-13T16:59:10,16
These are the comments that make me seriously question how many folks are here with flair that aren’t really conservatives. This comment is allegedly a libertarian who is now apparently advocating to raise the top tax rate? Really? For funding social security no less? No part of that makes sense from the start but then this is supposed to be a conservative sub and we have a per se Marxist position here as the top comment? I just don’t buy it.,deadzip10,2025-04-14T07:00:34,2
How long more are we going to fund this pyramid scheme? ,Reuters-no-bias-lol,2025-04-13T17:26:25,4
"It isn't.   Prople will whine that it's unfair to the precious little poor people, but a falt percentage-based tax across all income brackets would actually be fair.  Personally, I'd rather ditch them all in favor of a Fairtax-style model.",squunkyumas,2025-04-14T03:55:50,0
So you want to pay more income taxes to have cheaper prices?,dam4076,2025-04-13T18:09:07,48

"It's capped because benefits are capped.  Because it's not a tax, it's a contribution.  Either make it a tax (and all that entails) or don't cap benefits.",WIlf_Brim,2025-04-13T20:41:52,25

"You can be a libertarian, hate how we do social security, hate social security, and realize the genie is too far out of the bottle here to put it back in so the only way to handle it is to actually make it money solvent and not a debt spiral.   I wish we had more options than social security but unfortunately we don’t.",Derp2638,2025-04-13T17:20:14,114
I’m not a Marxist. If you look at my comment replying to someone else you can see me lamenting how much I hate social security and despise it.   You can also see me say that the genie is out of the bottle here and there’s no real way to put it back in so it needs to be paid for somehow. There are two ways.   1) Taxing people higher who make more but adding a stipulation that gives them extra $$$ in their social security check so they get something for paying more.   2) Economic growth. Very hard to do in practice where it would pay for it.   3) Ignore it and make my generation pay for it.,Derp2638,2025-04-14T07:28:32,3
I wish we didn’t,Derp2638,2025-04-13T17:37:25,-2
Agreed. Being even semi successful in this country and they just want to take it from you.   Taxes are out of control. ,Infyx,2025-04-14T07:55:00,-1

Yeah but people making millions every year should contribute the same percentage as you and I. Think of it as the fair tax,StratTeleBender,2025-04-14T07:25:25,2
98% pay more in than they ever collect assuming an absolutely abysmal rate of return on investment of like 4%.   The 2% collect very little.  So it's an absolute scam for all paying in.  The 98% subsidizing 2% should barely feel that subsidy.  The program is the biggest ripoff ever pulled on Americans.,ytilonhdbfgvds,2025-04-15T02:08:41,1
"Yes. Most of the high earners are making that money with thousands of employees who will eventually partake in SS. If we're going to have social programs, which we are because SS is never going away, then we have to tax accordingly to fund it",StratTeleBender,2025-04-14T08:35:24,1
"We have different definitions of what a libertarian is then.  The news has been fearmongering about social security running out of money since at least the 1980s. The easiest path to solving the funding issue is economic growth, not raising taxes.",dunkeater,2025-04-13T17:24:30,-42
"Putting aside that I don’t follow you around to see what you’ve said or not said, I never called you a Marxist. I did however specifically state that you’re occupying a per se Marxist position. The proof is in the pudding - you’re advocating for raising the taxes on the rich specifically so that you can redistribute that money via social security. I suspect your overly defensive reaction here (and in my messages) is probably telling.",deadzip10,2025-04-14T14:26:41,-2
But I’m also not paying for everyone else’s retirement if I am not getting what I paid into the system back. ,Infyx,2025-04-14T07:30:34,2
"If you make millions in income, between the Obamacare surcharge, federal income tax and state, you often are paying over 50%. Meanwhile a family at 150k might pay high teens effective rate. It’s not fair at all actually.",Unlucky-Prize,2025-04-14T08:36:48,-4
You don’t even have to go that high. Making 300-400k as an employee. Them too?  Fuck that. Stop taking money from us. ,Infyx,2025-04-14T09:24:00,-1
"Great how do you out economic growth the fact that lots of people are having far less kids and people are living longer which then causes more take from the system ?  Do I wish social security didn’t exist ? Yes. Do I realize that it likely will never go away ? Yes. There are really only two ways to actually pay for it.   1) Raise taxes on those that do very well to pay for it whilst also offering a higher payout for social security when they reach retirement age. Basically if you pay X amount of dollars for Y years then you get Z back.   2) Out economic growth the glut from social security. Which I don’t think is very feasible. You have people having far less kids, more people getting older and more living longer by a wide margin.",Derp2638,2025-04-13T17:37:11,35
"> The easiest path to solving the funding issue is economic growth, not raising taxes.  You can't grow your way into properly funding social security.  It is a demographic issue as much as it is a economic one.  Raising the cap on SS taxes to at a minimum to account for inflation would be a start.  After that, it is either raising taxes or taking benefits away from the people who spent their whole lives paying into it.",cathbadh,2025-04-13T20:12:12,15
"Welp, sorry buddy. These programs aren't going away. You have to fund them",StratTeleBender,2025-04-14T10:35:42,2
Raising taxes reduces purchasing and investing power and drags the economy down. Did you know tax revenue went up when Trump cut taxes his first term?  You’re greatly underestimating the difference in taxes collected between a booming vs contracting economy.,dunkeater,2025-04-13T18:00:33,-23
Never thought I’d see the day where a conservative demands others pay for his retirement in a redistributive scheme.,Unlucky-Prize,2025-04-14T10:44:31,-3
What choice do we have? Do you think SS is going away? Republicans won't even begin to touch that one. SS and Medicare are the third rail of politics. Part of being a conservative is also behaving realistically and responsibly and that means funding the programs.,StratTeleBender,2025-04-14T10:48:06,1
We could change medical regulations to enable competition and innovation and cost efficiency improvement. That would be huge. These bloated rent seeking hospital groups are mostly due to federal regulations.   We could change the Medicare formulary policy to require net benefit vs conventional for pricey new therapies that are very modest improvements. Right now a couple percent improvement in side effects for a cancer drug lets you suddenly charge half a mil a year instead of 10k and Medicare MUST cover. It’s nonsense.   We could reform Medicare advantage so it saves money   We could spend a lot more effort on Medicare fraud  Soc security needs very very gradual retirement age increases in the future but no one has been willing. People are going to live to 100+ a lot and in good health until 90 with the biotech stuff in the pipe and it’s going to get real bad so,Unlucky-Prize,2025-04-14T11:30:23,-1
"Again, no one is gonna change the retirement age or get rid of SS. Republicans won't even touch that one and Democrats definitely won't.",StratTeleBender,2025-04-14T17:14:43,1
