So another centrist that won't do much of anything?,metalkhaos,2025-04-23T10:59:12,11
Gillibrand likes him?   Thumbs down.,Slackjawed_Horror,2025-04-23T10:57:40,6
"*finally*, more boomers in office. it's what everyone wants.",hurdurBoop,2025-04-23T10:56:06,17
All dems care about is how much fundraising he can bring in. They have no principles.   Hopefully the young guns can keep up the pressure and get some change happening within the party.,Unusual_Ant_5309,2025-04-23T12:02:55,5
"He’s a normie centrist, but he’s perfect for winning in a state like NC.",samhit_n,2025-04-23T11:05:59,6
"I don’t want more boomers in office, but other than Jeff Jackson, there aren’t many strong young Democratic candidates in NC. Roy Cooper may be old, but he is a very popular ex-governor in NC.",samhit_n,2025-04-23T11:07:12,6
"If NC dems want to defeat Tilis, cooper is their best shot. Not everything is about age.",freakdazed,2025-04-23T13:16:15,0
"I don't care how old they are. If you're basing your opinion solely on someone's age, you're as bad as racist and sexist republicans. I care about ideology. I'd much rather have a 90 yr old bernie sanders than a 40 yr old jared kushner. But it sounds like you would prefer kushner simply because hes younger. ",Bakedads,2025-04-23T11:20:03,-5
"But will he fight for what's right? We don't need pragmatism right now. We need inspiration. We need moral clarity. We need strong principles. If it'd another democrat who is willing to ""work"" with republicans to harm people, then he can fuck right off. I'd rather lose every election while doing the right thing than win every election by sacrificing my principles. ",Bakedads,2025-04-23T11:23:00,4
"""all we've got is boomers"" is sort of an indictment, don't you think",hurdurBoop,2025-04-23T13:31:09,2
lol. k.,hurdurBoop,2025-04-23T11:26:03,-1
"[I thought he did a fairly decent job in my state](https://www.theassemblync.com/politics/roy-cooper-legacy-governor-north-carolina/), despite the onslaught of the republican legislature trying to thwart him at every angle.",VeeDubBug,2025-04-23T12:01:37,4
Well bring up some names of younger candidates who you are sure can defeat Tilis?,freakdazed,2025-04-23T16:36:04,-1
"you don't get that this is the problem.  ""he was super popular twenty years before you were born tho""  ""y gen z so conservatized?""",hurdurBoop,2025-04-23T16:46:35,2
