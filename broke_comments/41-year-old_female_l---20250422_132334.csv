"The navy itself has an age limit of 35, she just barely made it for that.  You can't wait until the last minute and expect your ""dream"" to be fulfilled.  What kind of idiot thinks ""yeah, military processing should be quick!""

"So, let's be careful about FAKE NEWS.It's not as dumb as I initially thought.  Basically, she is upset she got ""AGED OUT"" at 41. She isn't suing the Navy because she failed. She is suing the Navy because they aged her out and won't give her a waiver to try out for Buds, even though they have provided waivers for others to try out for Buds though they were also aged out.  She is just suing to get a waiver to be allowed to try out.  Is it dumb she is going to try out? Sure. Is it dumb she thinks she even has a chance? 100% yes. But, it's not completely some outrageous thing she is doing in terms of wanting the opportunity to at least try out, something they have allowed women to do for some time now, even though no woman has ever ever come close to getting through the program.  In other words, she isn't absolutely insane trying to sue because she failed and thinks she deserves to get in, it's really just her suing to get a waiver.",GeneticsGuy,2025-04-23T04:53:02,5

"It costs something like $half a million bucks to train a SEAL, and as an older guy, as much as it SUCKS - the fact is we humans start to enter the world of less capable physically long before this lady even sued.  The NAVY isn’t a jobs program nor is it make a wish, if we the taxpayers are going to spend $half a million training up an operator, it’s just pragmatically logical to expect a longer payback (enlistment) than we’ll get out of someone as old as her.

"As someone who washed out before making it to BUDS, this is insane. Simply the facts as stated make her unqualified for the training. The one thing I did learn about SEALs, and something I know I don't have, is they don't fucking quit. Not on anything. They don't take a break, they don't plan on dealing with a problem ""later"", the do what they need to do, and they do it until they get to where there want to be.

"I was a corpsman. When people fail BUDs, ""Buds duds"", they overwhelmingly choose corpsman as their job. The failures are still in the navy and have to do something for 4-5 years. The people that failed were very athletic. Like, in really good shape, probably able to run 15 miles then swim for a couple hours straight every day for a month. They still failed. Most common reason for failing/dropping from BUDs was the swim portion. Apparently, not many people actually train properly to swim in the ocean for hours.

The buds instructors would be trying to wash her out for the selfishness alone. Most of these high end operator roles take a stance with training as if you will be in their squad the next time they deploy and they don't want to go into war with someone that will get them or their team killed because they decided that glory and honor is the only thing that matters. If anything they would look for someone that is self sacrificing but also independent enough not to get themselves killed for no reason. At the end of the day this isn't a badge to be worn and shouldn't be treated as someones *I'm cool card*. Hopefully this lawsuit fails and hopefully the navy lets the seals continue their selection unhindered by outside influence like a general that only wants an extra point to promote.  Either way like others said 35 is the cut off for regular enlistment. You can waiver it or commission but that is in very specific circumstances and generally non-combat roles like doctors or therapists.,Katzchen12,2025-04-22T14:18:16,82
"$500,000 seems low, at least from when I was in a decade and a half ago.  In 2012 I met a bunch of fit and capable young men, who washed out of the “Boot Camp to BUDS” program they were running.  All of them were much more professional than this lady.   On top of that…it’s THE FUCKING NAVY SEALS! There aren’t women in combat jobs like that, for a reason.  My unit in the Marines got picked through for guys to participate in the Male/Female Workup package - from Infsntry basics to full-on Company-sized missions.  Just as everyone has talked about, women were a liability.     Male-only platoons, squads, and teams, all had the highest scores for completion of tasks and missions, with minimal casualties.     Behind them were the female-only ones, lacking in speed and strength - as is expected for a job requiring 50+ lbs of gear for everyday life. There were minor injuries, some which the women bounced back from, others which sidelined them.     Lastly, the mixed-gender units suffered the worst. Male Marines went out of their way to support the female Marines, at the cost of themselves. Injuries, both real and made-up for missions, happened due to men putting themselves in the way of danger for their fellow Marines, because they were women.  We all “knew” the outcome, but we had to have it fully done to give paper answers to that simple question.   Looping back to this lady…sorry, but not.",obiwanliberty,2025-04-22T17:11:33,2
