"279 people are eligible to vote. The people they interviewed didn’t want to comment on their position. History shows these are generally approved. History also shows that corporate towns are a horrific situation for people.  History repeats, and people lose.",Ancient_Popcorn,2025-04-24T09:45:26,20
"Didn’t we already try this idea 100 years ago? I look forward to Blue Origin Town where all the employees are paid in Bezoscoin, only redeemable at Amazon.",Imaginary-Anybody186,2025-04-24T09:43:04,12
Incorporation like these are always a way to dodge county taxes & regulations. We have the same problem in Ohio.    The level of corruption just reeks.,Competitive-Bike-277,2025-04-24T09:48:47,8

"It's only recently I've been reading about Curtis Yarvin, Balaji Srinivasan, etc. Was already familiar with Musk, and Peter Theil. Regarding Yarvin, Srinivasan, etc, I didn't realize there's a whole tech bro movement to create technofeudalism societies both in the US and elsewhere.    Can't help but wonder if thats part of Trump's motivation on acquiring Greenland. Wasn't too long ago Trump was talking about creating ""freedom towns."" Now Musk is getting his own town, Starbase. Revenge of the Nerds meets The Empire Strikes Back. ​",Baron_Wellington_718,2025-04-24T11:19:07,1
So gross. Just another way to get his ego stroked after his abhorrent behavior has turned off a great deal of the globe.,papayabutterfly,2025-04-24T14:41:53,1
I’m for this.  A lot of cities are named after white colonists.  We need non-offensive neutral names and the stars belong to everyone.,dbag3o1,2025-04-24T09:56:47,-16

"This is America my guy. 90%+ of this country doesn't know what happened a decade ago, much less a century. Hell, if you went outside and threw a rock, odds are the person you hit couldn't tell you how long a century is. We're not a smart country, we just play one on tv.",Beneficial_Soup3699,2025-04-24T19:57:17,1
"Greenland is a separate issue. They have rare earth minerals that are required for electronics/high tech products.   Now that China is retaliating by blocking sales of rare earth minerals to the US, the desire to take Greenland will ramp up",murkywaters--,2025-04-24T14:24:13,1
This is about the creation of a company town not the name. They already named the area Starbase but now Space-X wants to run the area as its own town.,GeminiCrushed,2025-04-24T10:15:50,7

"That's part of his motivation, but I wouldn't downplay the technofeudalism aspirations. The men in the following articles are in Trump and Vance's ears. They have far more in mind than minerals.
