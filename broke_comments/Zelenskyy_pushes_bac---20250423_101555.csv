"“There is nothing to talk about — it is our land, the land of the Ukrainian people,” Zelenskyy   Zelenskyy isn't going to let Trump give his country to Putin.",SAJ-13,2025-04-23T10:17:20,19
Putin should be giving the land he stole back. The US should be fully backing Ukraine and only Ukraine.,Kafkaesque92,2025-04-23T10:28:59,10
I will take it a step further. I am for the complete military dismantling of the Russian Federation as a state and the free elections for the people of Russia or any state declaring independence from the former Russian Federation territory. Be that from military aid to Ukraine or our own military force. Remove all restrictions on US arms in Ukraine and give them whatever they ask for.,Classicman269,2025-04-23T13:59:10,2
