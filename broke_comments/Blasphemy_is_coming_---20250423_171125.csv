"""The only reason Trump is attending the funeral of Francis is to hog the spotlight, to feed the bottomless void of his ego, and to turn a moment of global mourning into another grotesque sideshow, all about Trump.  The eyes of the world will be on St. Peter’s Square on Saturday, and Trump wouldn’t miss this colossal media event for anything in the world. And there isn’t a reason in the world that Trump should be there. I think Pope Francis tried to love everyone, and I also think Francis could spot a phony — and a blatant sinner — a mile away, and he no doubt saw the despicable Trump for who he really is.""",Electronic-Prize-314,2025-04-23T17:26:10,55

"I believe Francis struck a deal with the Almighty. Francis wanted one more time to celebrate Easter. He was granted that wish and was called home.   I am of the opinion that Trump has to be at his funeral and the celebration of Francis’ life. Trump’s presence will provide a stark contrast between a pauper who died with no material wealth and a man who spent his life fretting away any wealth handed him.   Francis had his imperfections, he was human. Dedicating his life to teachings of Christ, that is divine. A testimony, he stopped 3 American cities to celebrate his visits.   It was pointed out to me years ago that God uses far more than words to communicate with us. I can’t help to think the contrast of Francis and Trump is one of these moments.",Total-Being-7723,2025-04-23T22:13:49,3

Trump is not attending the pope’s funeral as a statesman. He’s attending as a showman. This is political theater covered in the cloak of mourning. Trump does not represent the American people, not the ones who believe in decency, in mercy, in solidarity with the suffering. He is not our moral ambassador. He is a walking perversion of this solemn moment.

The American branch has been treading closer and closer to Protestant theologies over my lifetime.   I think it has something to do with them wanting to appear not so different to more mainstream sects in America and in part due to the unholy alliance formed with anti abortion activists over there cross-pollinating their ideas.,Wrath_Ascending,2025-04-24T05:31:11,6
"Yes. The charismatic renewal and alignment with far-right politics have led to the shift. Add to that a big outflux of liberal Catholics because of the church's massive child sex abuse crisis, deference to forced birthers, and treatment of the LGBTQ+ community, women, etc., and you have today's US Catholic church.",GF_baker_2024,2025-04-24T05:46:37,2

"Trump is a symptom of this culture that’s been growing in  America (and that’s honestly been here from the start). He is not the cause of it. Maybe the MAGA crowd will be disorganized immediately after he passes, but give it time.

It is VERY good for what the tech billionaires want to do. It would be VERY good for the right. MAGA would be mobilized to do whatever they wanted.  It is a nightmare scenario for the US. I have a sneaky suspicion Vance might be better at subterfuge and making things appear normal. He would bring a 'sane' face to the movement. They would rally around him.,SatoriFound70,2025-04-23T18:48:28,2
"Their politics started dictating their religion years ago.  They abandoned the kingdom of heaven and want a kingdom on earth.  They’ve spent 4 decades slowly erasing the Christ from their Christianity and replacing it with a celebration of wealth and worldly power.  They have become the Pharisees, but the Pharisees at least presumably lived by their own rules.",aradraugfea,2025-04-24T21:01:48,1
