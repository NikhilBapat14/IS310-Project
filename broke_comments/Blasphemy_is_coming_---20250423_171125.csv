Francis had his imperfections, he was human. Dedicating his life to teachings of Christ, that is divine. A testimony, he stopped 3 American cities to celebrate his visits.

A Christian judge made my husband spend a night in jail for giving his daughter Bible verses and telling her to go over them with an adult when she told him she was getting baptized. She said it was disparaging to their religion (his exes). They are Christians. It was Bible verses!   They need to tell me where this anti Christian bias is coming from cuz I don't see it. I see anti everyone else bias, but not anti Christian. They are just pissed they were getting called out on being hateful, harmful human beings. Oh no, we didn't let you discriminate against someone. We made you dispense a medication or give out a marriage certificate. If you can't do the job due to your religion then quit. Freaking ridiculous.",SatoriFound70,2025-04-24T14:42:47,1

The American branch has been treading closer and closer to Protestant theologies over my lifetime.   I think it has something to do with them wanting to appear not so different to more mainstream sects in America and in part due to the unholy alliance formed with anti abortion activists over there cross-pollinating their ideas.,Wrath_Ascending,2025-04-24T05:31:11,6
"Yes. The charismatic renewal and alignment with far-right politics have led to the shift. Add to that a big outflux of liberal Catholics because of the church's massive child sex abuse crisis, deference to forced birthers, and treatment of the LGBTQ+ community, women, etc., and you have today's US Catholic church.",GF_baker_2024,2025-04-24T05:46:37,2

It is VERY good for what the tech billionaires want to do. It would be VERY good for the right. MAGA would be mobilized to do whatever they wanted.  It is a nightmare scenario for the US. I have a sneaky suspicion Vance might be better at subterfuge and making things appear normal. He would bring a 'sane' face to the movement. They would rally around him.,SatoriFound70,2025-04-23T18:48:28,2
"Their politics started dictating their religion years ago.  They abandoned the kingdom of heaven and want a kingdom on earth.  They‚Äôve spent 4 decades slowly erasing the Christ from their Christianity and replacing it with a celebration of wealth and worldly power.
