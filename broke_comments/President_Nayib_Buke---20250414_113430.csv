"Is it not a little concerning that the Government can make an ""administrative error"", send someone in custody to a prison in a foreign country in contravention of a lawful court order and then its just ""oh well, not our problem""?

Why is the mainstream media so keen on having gang members on the US territory?,AstraVolans_21,2025-04-14T11:58:45,193
">Sandoval-Moshenberg [Attorney for the Defendent] said that those charges [2025] are false, and that the gang label stems from a 2019 incident  >Abrego Garcia and his family hired an attorney and fought the government’s attempt to deport him [in 2019]  >He received “withholding of removal” six months later, a protected status. It is not a path to permanent U.S. residency it means the government won’t deport him back to his home country, because he’s more likely than not to face harm there.  The way this reads, they contested the deportation attempt and not the (potentially false) allegations of active/former gang membership. But to me, the fact that they didn't grant him asylum but still granted protection tells me that he is a former gang member who fled to the US to get out of the gang. He still has gang ties, hence the non-permanent-citizen path the 2019 judge put him on because giving him a full path would include citizenship with known gang ties. Being a former high-ranking gang member would absolutely put your satefy at risk upon return. Being a seemingly otherwise normal family man would not, and if it did, they'd have given him asylum in 2019.  The 2019 Withholding order is Exhibit A:   [Abrego Garcia v. Noem, 8:25-cv-00951 – CourtListener.com](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69777799/abrego-garcia-v-noem/)  He claimed that his family was being harassed to pay a ""tax"" by Barrio 18 for their papusa business.  The business closed and his parents moved to Guatamala and if you read the conclusion the order references that circumstances in Guatamala had not changed.  The man either had gang ties and was given protected status because of his gang ties, or used those past-now-nulled threats as a lie to get into the US. Alien Enemies Act supercedes given that those facts were established through due process in 2019. The court found his gang ties meritted the protected status - that's why it was granted to him. They did not find him in enough danger to give full asylum.   The error here is still on the government, but not on the current administration. Garcia should have been given asylum and a path to citizenship: This is a prime example of a broken immigration system. But it's not a breach of due process under the Enemies Act. Whether the Enemies Act is constitutional is an entirely separate argument.",deciduousredcoat,2025-04-14T11:54:28,93
"The whole argument stops when the PRESIDENT of the country he was deported to says ""Why would i release a murderer. I could not and will not do that"". Thats it.  Edit: the president says terrorist and then says murder capital of the world. I switched these in my mind. However, these two classifications are used synonymously in my mind.

"I mean. I've been to Thailand before.    Can a district judge in Thailand compel the US government to ship me over there?    Is the actual argument here that if you've ever been anywhere, random judges in that locale are able to force your government to send you wherever they want?    The fact he was in the US for a while makes no difference. The fact he wants to be here (presumably) makes no difference.    I understand the concerns around a slippery slope. I really do.    But the ""If the president can deport an illegal Venezuelan gang member he can deport anyone"" is a really stupid stretch.    The left didn't freak out when Obama drowned an American citizen to death without a trial. You know why? He was a terrorist. But the right didn't go ""ooh, if you can drone a terrorist to death you can drone anyone"" because that's a stupid fucking thing to say.

"The whole debate over this is fucking ridiculous.  Kilmar Garcia entered the United States **ILLEGALLY**. This is an ***indisputable fact***.   There are some rights that citizens have that non-citizens do not. This is also an indisputable fact.   Non-citizens do NOT have the RIGHT to be in this country, *especially* if they are here illegally. Once again, politicians and judges are prioritizing non-citizens over the American people.   The idea that this ""undermines due process"" is nonsense, fear-mongering bullshit. Due process doesn't, or at least shouldn't, apply to removing non-citizens. They do not have the right to be here.   ACB is a disappointment, and Roberts is a coward. My guess is that President Trump and President Bukele had a prior conversation in which they decided that Bukele was going to announce his refusal to send Garcia back. This is the kind of strong leadership we need to fix the US, and the kind of strong leadership that has turned El Salvador from one of the most dangerous to perhaps the safest country in the world.",Fact_Stater,2025-04-14T15:35:05,14

"Let's take that to its logical conclusion. Is it your position then that the US Supreme Court said that United States must use an implied threat of military force or economic sanctions to convince El Salvador to send its own citizen to the United States?  That's what makes a request from the United States have any meaning at all to a foreign power, the United States military and economic force.  No the Supreme Court said that the United States must ""facilitate"" their return. I'd take that to mean that if El Salvador wants to send him here we must make it easy for them to do so, but he doesn't. So that's the end of the story.

"Wrong. I see nothing in that ruling that states people deported under the alien enemies act have due process rights, or even illegal immigrants for that matter.  I see due process mentioned in the **dissenting** opinion, which is not the opinion or ruling of the court.   I do see what seems to be the court saying they may have the right to judicial review, which is not what due process means. That’s just a judge reviewing their filing.   More blatant lies peddled by you. I look at your comment history, it’s full time anti -Trump and anti-conservative rhetoric, while swearing up and down that you are “totes a Republican and totes hate Kamala and stuff”. But yet you hate every conservative policy ever. And you hate the constitution and shit all over the powers it has vested in the President, and the legitimate  powers congress has expanded to the President via things like the Alien Enemies Act.

"There is nothing to worry about because he got his due process in 2019. Courts ruled back then that he was a member of a gang, which is now a terrorist organization. Being affiliated with a terrorist organization is immediate grounds for deportation, no matter someone's immigration/protection status. There is nothing to process because he received it in 2019. He is eligible for deportation. The supreme court ruled he was eligible for deportation (assuming El Salvador accepts him, which they did). The courts ruled that everyone deserves due process, I agree, and it's a good thing nobody had this right violated! Not even the man in question, his rights were not violated! He was deported after receiving due process and was now accepted back into his home country. There is literally NOTHING to be worried about.
