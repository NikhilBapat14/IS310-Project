After Schakowsky was outraised by Kat Abughazaleh. I don't think this would have happened without Abughazaleh entering the race and pressuring her. Hope I'm wrong but I'm guessing Schakowsky's gonna endorse a more conservative candidate to spite her.,sideAccount42,2025-04-23T13:53:38,-1
"Usually the way to do this is to see what their previous quarter's fundraising looked like. Durbin's retirement was already well-known but the Q1 numbers made it obvious he was retiring since he raised like $200K or something (you would usually get millions for a Senate run in a large state, especially since Senate leadership kicks money into the DSCC). You don't need to raise as much if you're in a safe seat but it still matters there.  Based on those metrics, it's possible that Danny Davis retires too, as he only raised $8K last quarter and is 83 years old.",Isentrope,2025-04-23T13:17:17,4
"Disagree with this take, Schakowsky, while old, was prob one of the most progressive members of the house and has consistently stood by those beliefs for 20+ years. If anything, I think this is her acknowledging that it is time for her to step aside for younger progressives",TheDragon76,2025-04-23T14:01:15,6
"It very likely would have happened either way. I don't think Jan would back down from a challenge if she wanted to. Maybe she took this as an opportunity to retire at an opportunity where we have a chance to reclaim the narrative and raise new voices... But I doubt it.   I'm interested to see her announcement on the 5th.   Does she name an heir apparent and the democratic establishment goes all in on one pony against Kat?   Or does she step back and encourage those interested to get involved in potentially a multi-way race?   Announcing early actually could have hurt Kat's chances if it encouraged Jan to play kingmaker.   But no, I don't think she'll cut off her nose to spite her face. She'll pick someone aligned with her values of she makes an endorsement. She's not capping off her long career by passing the baton to someone she doesn't believe in.   Also, in case it wasn't obvious, I think Kat's chance of getting an endorsement is basically 0.",2pnt0,2025-04-23T15:34:59,1
"We'll see who/if she endorses. I said I hope I'm wrong.  Edit: Actually, her position on Israel is kinda psychotic.   > As a Jewish American, I have a deep personal connection to the State of Israel  This is incredibly anti-semitic. It's like saying dual-loyalty is good actually. Seems like she was supportive of suspending some weapons to Israel so maybe she's thinks a little bit of anti-semitism is good for optics?   https://schakowsky.house.gov/issues/israel",sideAccount42,2025-04-23T16:19:34,-1
"Yeah I didn’t know about her foreign policy positions too much, her domestic policy is largely ok, but yeah, this position on Israel is extremely questionable. No mention of genocide or wanting to cut funding of arms to Israel. Tbf this makes Kat’s initial decision to primary her make more sense as Kat is Palestinian iirc",TheDragon76,2025-04-23T16:23:19,1
Thank you. I'm being completely sincere when I say this but I don't think many people (myself included) would take that in as well you have.   I will say it does look like she had openness to cutting weapons. Not as far as I'd like but it's something.   https://schakowsky.house.gov/media/press-releases/schakowsky-jayapal-castro-doggett-mcgovern-lee-pocan-jacobs-balint-statement,sideAccount42,2025-04-23T16:35:18,1
"I appreciate the compliment, imo we need to view all these politicians objectively from what positions they’ve held in the past as well as currently and make honest judgements based on that. I think a lot of people fall into the trap of “oh they’re a democrat so obviously they support this”, but there are so many differences currently because the party doesn’t really have any central messaging. If we are unwilling to accept the facts in front of us and change opinions, we aren’t really any different from Republicans lmao",TheDragon76,2025-04-23T16:59:40,2
