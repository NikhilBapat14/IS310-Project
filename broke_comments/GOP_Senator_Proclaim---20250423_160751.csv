">As tensions mount between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy over stalled peace talks, a GOP senator sparked international backlash by publicly praising ""President Putin"" as a leader committed to ""peace.""  >North Dakota Sen. Kevin Cramer made waves Wednesday when he insisted that Russian President Vladimir Putin, as well as Zelenskyy, were both committed to ""peace"" in an appearance on CNN.  Putin is destroying all that the USA used to stand for.  Destroying any faith left in the justice system.  Pitting American against American.  Destroying decades old alliances and friendships.  Isolating and destroying what was once a well respected nation.  He's burning your vaunted constitution as you look on.  And turning your country into a laughing stock.  Yet only a very few of you are bothered enough to do anything about it.",04FS,2025-04-23T16:12:18,6
"> Auferre, trucidare, rapere, falsis nominibus imperium, atque, ubi solitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant  To raid, slaughter and steal, this they falsely call empire and where they create a desolation they call it peace.  Nice to see nothing really changes in 2 millennia, except that today's politicians are even less self aware and honest about what they are doing.",barryvm,2025-04-23T16:35:10,3

"“It’s just a small part, they’ll stop if you let them keep it.”  Later… “well who could’ve known that the new Russian border of Crimea would’ve invaded what’s left of Ukraine? Maybe if you give them a bit more land…”  Every reporting medium possible should be focused on how Zelenskyy is right to not trust their invader to stop with Crimea. Even using wording like “rejected” seems to place blame on Ukraine. Ridiculous. Of course they’ll refuse. Russia hasn’t played well with any peace talks or even confirmed agreements so far, have they? Why would they stop after breaking through? Once they get a piece they’ll get the whole thing ",TheDoctorDB,2025-04-23T16:19:35,2
