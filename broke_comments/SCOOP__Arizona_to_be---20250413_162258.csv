Watch AZ go red next election after this. Who would've guessed? Funny how that works.,ITrCool,2025-04-13T16:27:24,102
So the senate seat was stolen. The win margin was very small.,BucDan,2025-04-14T11:01:49,5

Nothing to see here. Just a small city's worth of illegal voters.,Rush2201,2025-04-13T19:23:06,19

Would’ve picked up a Senate seat if anyone besides Kari Lake was the candidate.,kgthdc2468,2025-04-13T21:38:36,20
Sadly unlikely since so many liberals fled there from CA.,A_Hatless_Casual,2025-04-13T17:57:40,15
That talking points has been debunked so many fuckin times it makes my head hurt seeing people constantly spouting it. The vast majority of people who have left CA are conservatives finally tired of not having a voice. Polls have shown that CA transplants have a higher percentage of right leaning voters among them than the native populations of the areas they move to even in places like Texas. The real culprit for states that used to be hard red turning more purple is universities. Where is the one place you can be guaranteed to find crazy leftist ideology even in the reddest of states? A college campus. And in the last decade they have ramped up the indoctrination by a lot compared to previous decades.,The_Mighty_Rex,2025-04-14T01:29:30,20
"I know some Californians who left California because the military or work wanted them elsewhere. The only Californians I know that moved 100% voluntarily are literally the most aggressively right wing people I know. I'm talking waving Trump signs on overpasses, helping run multiple petitions to recall Newsom, getting kicked off airplanes during covid for refusing to wear a mask (while also wearing a maga hat).    I'm sure left leaning people have left CA for greener pastures, but they more often go to places that already have similar politics. West Coast, East Coast, or Denver/Austin. They can't survive more than like 20 miles from a Whole Foods.",Mountain_Man_88,2025-04-14T09:44:50,8
