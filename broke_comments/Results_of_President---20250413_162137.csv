"The left, 2024: Biden is a shining example of physical health and mental acuity. Sharp. As. A. Tack.  The left, 2025: Trump's clean bill of health is nothing more than propaganda!",the_house_from_up,2025-04-13T19:43:51,51

"*""President Trump remains in excellent health, exhibiting robust cardiac, pulmonary, neurological, and general physical function,"" read the release by Navy Capt. Sean P. Barbabella, the physician to the president.*   If you watch Trump, the amazing part is how much he is living his best life. Reporters and other politicians are there for career reasons and you can tell as Trump goes long winded that he is absolutely loving it and just living his life while the others are ready to leave and further their own agenda.   In the white house interview he did with Big Gretch, it was very telling. He was just living his best life and could have went on hours longer. Everyone else was there for their own reasons. Big Gretch whom Trump praised, seemed laid back surprisingly considering she knows her voters were going to hate her for being there. The only pat on the back I can give her for anything in her career really.   Anyway, just always seems amazing how Trump seems to be living his best life these days and absolutely loves what he is going.",chances906,2025-04-13T16:51:10,0

"The dumbest thing Iâ€™ve seen on Reddit is trying to equate Trumpâ€™s long windedness to Bidenâ€™s mental decline. Like no, random redditor, Trump is speaking like he did 10 years ago, unlike Biden who looks like he blue screens every 5 minutes during a speech.",i_dont_do_hashtags,2025-04-13T17:51:48,21
