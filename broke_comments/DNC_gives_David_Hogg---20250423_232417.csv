"They’re fighting to keep corporate interests in power. They know corporate America will probably ditch Trumpism and MAGA, or at least are just about ready to do so. Of course, they need a recession first.   You can see this with RFK JR playing out right now, and he’s likely going to be the test case for how much intellectual “diarrhea” voters will accept. RFK has said he plans to figure out the cause of autism by September. Truth is, he’s not going to do any research, instead he will be going on all these podcasts over the course of months to talk about it with podcasters. This will make MAGA’s feel like it was a very transparent process and they will be in tune with every update made on each podcast. Will probably start off with the bigger podcasters. Anyways, the gist is that there is no cure or remedy for Autism besides stimulants. But stimulants are prescribed in a very narrow range of cases. Expect the classic, “adderall=meth” and all the MAGAs will be outraged that the cure for Autism is hardcore illegal drugs. At that moment, RFK will switch up to talk about “miracle cures” touted by naturalists and have a personal anecdote. Expect the mainstream media like the NYTimes to put a very soft fight and “expose” the personal anecdotes. If voters still aren’t too skeptical, then corporate interests will have won.   By the way, a strange thing is happening. It seems like Conservatives are launching a full scale attack campaign against medical privacy. First we have abortions, then trans medical treatment, and finally autism databases. It all seems to be converging on eroding medical rights.   Anyways, at the end of it all is the Democrat party. If corporate interests get everything they want, they will let small businesses go bankrupt so they can overtake market share. Then they’ll bring in the Democrats to stabilize the economy and increase profits once again. ",JollyToby0220,2025-04-24T03:14:07,35

He doesn't seem to have other significant policy positions.  At this particular moment, I hope it's not lost on anyone that a *lot* of Democrats and independents who may not have been that interested in gun rights are reevaluating their positions at a time when Trump is considering invoking the insurrection act. So the one position Hogg is known for will crater his influence with voters across the entire political spectrum.  The DNC went with Hogg because he's young, but he's not cut out for this. If he wants to run his own agenda, he can do that on his own. There are plenty of other candidates who could execute his role more effectively and become more reliable standard bearers for reinvigorating the party.  My local Democratic party's been a zombie party for the last decade. Hogg came to town for a fundraiser last month and gave an inkling of life to them. Problem is, you had to spend a minimum $500 just to get into the reception and get kicked out a short while later. Dinner was more expensive and went up as high as $20,000. I'm sure they raised some money so my local party can keep sucking in oxygen but he did fuck-all for actually energizing voters while he was in town.",Boomshtick414,2025-04-24T00:44:03,6

By the time election season does come around, people are just gonna stay home or vote for the next person with an R next to their name.   I don’t see why a hypothetical vote right now would matter.

"Yes. Bernie registered as a Democrat in 2016 to run in the primary. Not to mention he caucused with Democrats for years, voted with them almost 100% of the time, and ran within the system, by the rules.  So unless you're arguing that the DNC should only serve career insiders and party loyalists, in which case, congrats on admitting it's a rigged club, then his membership status is irrelevant.
