"There has been buttloads of this type of rage bait, particularly in r/facepalm, most of which can be easily chalked up to standard ""new administration redecorating things"".  Malicious compliance to stir pots and create more rage bait?  Not out of the question.  Something that would have been put back up when the redecorating was finished? Also possible.

"“Air Force public affairs representatives from Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina, where Malachowski was a former commander of the 333rd Fighter Squadron, confirmed to 9NEWS that the articles were removed as part of compliance with presidential directives targeting DEI content.”  That sounds a WHOLE LOT like malicious compliance to me…",cliffotn,2025-04-17T13:17:17,273

Or just compliance. Was she notable for her record compared to other pilots or commanders? Or was she notable for being the first woman doing those jobs?    Edit: Downvotes instead of proof she was a noteworthy pilot? Seems legit lol,PFirefly,2025-04-17T11:12:42,-192

Flying for the thunderbirds is an honor. They would not select an average pilot. It requires skill above a normal pilot because 1 mistake and people die. ,Long_Jelly_9557,2025-04-17T12:30:43,419

""There was indeed a time when women and minorities could not fly aircraft in defense of their country.

so all Thunderbird pilots have their honors mentioned on the website?,Papa_Ganda,2025-04-17T13:51:45,19
"I agree. The question is, did she have a page because all Thunderbirds pilots have pages or did she have a page simply because she’s female? If all pilots have pages, it should be restored. If no other pilots have a page then she’s just being treated exactly like all the male pilots. I don’t know which it is because I don’t know if all pilots had pages or not.",clonexx,2025-04-18T02:48:40,1
"I would certainly hope so, but that doesn't mean she has a particularly noteworthy career. She could just as easily have been the best female pilot when a spot opened up, and not actually the best pilot in general for selection. That's the biggest issue with DEI initiatives. Even if she was the best of the best, it calls into question if she actually was, or if it was a PR move.    Besides becoming part of the thunderbird's, has she done anything unique or particularly remarkable equal to other pilots recorded in history?    If so, then clearly removing her webpage is a mistake that should be corrected.",PFirefly,2025-04-17T14:06:09,-76
"Yeah, she said that *after* the content was removed. Women were not allowed in combat aviation roles before 1994 so I’d say there was a pretty significant barrier, wouldn’t you agree?  This malicious compliance has been an ongoing thing with them. Removing some article about women breaking stereotypes is one thing, but they are deleting biographical content and historical photos of Jeannie Leavitt simply because they were tagged “first female fighter pilot.” That’s not cool. Here’s another article from the Air Force Times last month which goes into more detail:  [Air Force purges photos, websites on pioneering female pilots](https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/your-air-force/2025/03/18/air-force-purges-photos-websites-on-pioneering-female-pilots/)",zip117,2025-04-17T23:18:26,40

"They took down most webpages on Jeannie Leavitt too. Purely historical content. If you don’t know who that is, I’ll let you do your own research. This isn’t a move I’d rush to defend.  I think they got the message and this will be corrected in short order.",zip117,2025-04-17T14:12:18,134
"The important information in regards to the Thunderbirds is if all pilots have pages or if just she had a page. If all Thunderbird pilots do, then hers should be restored. If no other Thunderbird pilots have a page, then here being removed is just treating her equally with the male pilots.  I don’t know what the details are with the pages for Jeannie Leavitt.",clonexx,2025-04-18T02:51:43,0
"I'm not rushing to defend anything. I'm asking question since people are rushing to condemn things.    The op called it malicious compliance, inferring that she is noteworthy enough for a page despite her gender and not because of it. I simply asked for evidence of that.    I think it was a crap move to remove Joseph Medicine Crow from his unit's page, and it was clearly bad application of DEI purging. I want to know if this is the same or not.   P.S. Jeannie Leavitt still has her page up on the main USAF webpage. Not sure what's missing from the web that ought not to be ",PFirefly,2025-04-17T14:21:26,-39
"I think we’re just going to have to disagree on that one. Logically, in the interest of 100% fairness, this makes sense. But I think the fact that a woman can even be a Thunderbirds pilot is a pretty significant fact to publicize since women weren’t allowed in combat aviation roles before 1994. Women born that year would only be the second or third generation to have that opportunity today. If my daughter wanted to be a fighter pilot I would want her to know such an opportunity exists. Given that the Thunderbirds are specifically a public outreach program (and by some extension, recruiting) that’s the perfect place to publicize that information.  But as I said, I can see where you’re coming from. If this article was specifically about breaking stereotypes and used other DEI language I wouldn’t be arguing against this move, but it doesn’t (in my opinion) and more importantly that’s not the extent of what’s happening here. Per the [Air Force Times](https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/your-air-force/2025/03/18/air-force-purges-photos-websites-on-pioneering-female-pilots/) they are also removing historical photos of Jeannie Leavitt simply because they were tagged “first female fighter pilot.” Do you agree with that, and where does it stop? Should NASA start removing any content which mentions Sally Ride was the first American woman to fly in space?",zip117,2025-04-18T03:57:18,29
"I found the original article and posted it elsewhere in this thread. There is a Newsweek article with more details but you’ll have to search for it (my link is getting removed). They removed a number of biographies, but only for women. After seeing the removals in aggregate I think you’ll probably agree that this was poorly thought out if not malicious compliance. They already started restoring some content.",zip117,2025-04-17T14:39:26,62
"If there are firsts, then a historical page should be maintained. Since Nicole is the first female Thunderbird, then she should have a historical page dedicated to that, as should Jeannie Leavitt and Sally Ride. I missed the word “first” when I read the subject of this post.  The only thing I’ll add is, this does seem like malicious compliance just to stick a middle finger up to the President. No policy that’s been implemented has attempted to target pages honoring people who were firsts in their field. Those pages are the antithesis of DEI and non merit based awards or promotions. Nicole, Jeannie and Sally all earned their places with merit, by working their asses off and getting ahead. That deserves recognition, and I don’t believe it’s those pages or that type of recognition that is being targeted by Trump. Which means this is just people who either dislike Trump or the policies and they are removing sites that aren’t really supposed to be removed just to create a story and make the policy and the President look bad. There’s pages dedicated to the “first” men to do certain things military wise, I’m sure. If those aren’t being taken down, then I can’t see how they could deny that this is malicious compliance by removing pages that were never meant to be removed nor ordered to be removed.",clonexx,2025-04-18T04:30:54,3
I agree that I probably would. I know the the Joseph Medicine Crow one was essentially an bot program that scanned for certain words and then took down pages. It wasn't thought out very well. Seems like potentially the same thing here. I still don't know what about this particular person would warrant a reversal though ;),PFirefly,2025-04-17T15:12:31,5
"I guess we do agree. I certainly don’t think this needs to be publicized on an ongoing basis or for less significant accomplishments, just the significant firsts. They don’t need to remove articles from 2013 (before the breakdown of all sanity circa 2015) or historical photos from the National Museum of the US Air Force… As you said in your other comment, this looks a *whole lot* like malicious compliance.",zip117,2025-04-18T04:46:12,0
"We indeed do agree. If I hadn’t missed the word “first” in the title, I probably wouldn’t have even posted anything or just wrote that I agree that the pages are merit based and are being taken down by a malicious actor on purpose, not by order.",clonexx,2025-04-18T04:49:28,3
