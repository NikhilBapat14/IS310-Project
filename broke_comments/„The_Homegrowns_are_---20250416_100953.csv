"I'd say that the odds are 50/50 that Kilmar Garcia will end up dead or otherwise unable to seek restitution.   Like 2017, **Otto Warmbier**, the American college student that North Korea imprisoned and then released in a vegetative state 18 months later.",ginrumryeale,2025-04-16T14:07:05,21

"No, it's asking us this: What are you going to do about it?   That's the question. That the reason for the deportations and all of the lies. They have instilled fear into the populace with a sense of rapid, hurried desperation.    Because they have started down a road from which there is no turning back for them.    They now must succeed to avoid the consequences. This is a step, and a calculated one. They test the waters of oppression. ",Answer_Free,2025-04-16T14:20:08,5

And we need far more people like this. So many liberals sat out the last election and now legal residents are being deported without due process.,AdOne5089,2025-04-16T15:01:33,7
