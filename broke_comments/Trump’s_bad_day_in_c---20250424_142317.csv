"Speaking as a *lawyer*, the big, unspoken thing that Trump is doing wrong tactically is that he‚Äôs completely tarnishing the credibility of the Justice Department in the courts.  Trial lawyers know that their credibility and believability is everything in a courtroom. If a judge or jury isn‚Äôt buying what they‚Äôre selling, they‚Äôre toast.  Judges are rapidly souring on this administration and even friendly jurisdictions are becoming distrustful.    The courts can still hinder the Trump administration in a big way regardless of whether he follows their orders or not.  The success of his administration still depends on his administration winning some of its most important criminal, civil, contract, trade, finance, and other matters‚Ä¶. *in the courts*.  If judges are detecting that they‚Äôre the last line of defense between the Constitution and a raging egomaniacal aspiring dictator, they have a lot of tools at their disposal to derail the administration‚Äôs enforcement of its agenda.

"They can very dramatically shift the outcome of cases before them.  Think about Judge Cannon‚Äôs influence on the Mar-a-Lago documents case.  Or think about what would have happened if she had instead been the judge in Trump‚Äôs hush money case in NY, and how differently that would have played out.  Courts may not always be able to compel the Trump administration to do something, but they could prevent it from receiving the rulings it wants that would allow it to more fully implement its agenda.  For example, they could end up keeping Harvard‚Äôs tax exempt status intact and deprive Trump of the ruling he would need to force them to pay taxes.  Sure, he could in theory go full dictator and become his own judge, jury and executioner.  But until then, he‚Äôs potentially making a lot of his administration‚Äôs matters before the courts much more of an uphill battle.",PerniciousPeyton,2025-04-24T19:09:01,1
They can legally deputize people to enforce and arrest anyone they want. Courts have the power to create a militia to enforce their judgements if no one else will.   There are certainly plenty of people who would gladly wear a badge to arrest Trump.,khronos127,2025-04-24T17:40:14,1
"Contempt charges for the DoJ personnel relevant to each case.  He'll pardon them, or let them twist in the wind, but they can't stand before those judges again.  Trump will have to bring in new attorneys, likely tell them to stall like the last ones did, judges will hold *them* in contempt.  Within a few weeks, he'll either be down to inexperienced, barely competent lawyers, or no-one at all.  Attorneys can also be disbarred if their actions are shown to be incompetent, malicious, etc,  That would cost them their careers, so anyone who agrees to work with Trump will be very careful to avoid that outcome.  Lastly, even if the U.S. Marshalls refuse to do their duty as enforcement for the courts, the Supreme Court can deputize any person or persons they wish to carry out their orders.  Issue warrants, make arrests, take people into custody, hold them in an appropriate facility.  And those deputies would answer solely to the courts.  Trump could issue one of his little Executive Orders for them to be fired and it would have no merit, no teeth.  Congress can't touch them, either.  The Judicial Branch isn't helpless, or without the power to compel compliance even from the office of the president or Congress.",LuminaraCoH,2025-04-24T18:07:07,1

You say ‚Äúthe courts may not always be able to compel‚Äù.  Had there been any situation where the courts have been able to when he‚Äôs not willing to go along with it? Isn‚Äôt that what‚Äôs causing so much alarm - that the courts simply cannot compel, or at least have not so far.    You also say that his success depends on his administration winning numerous legal battles in court and that the judicial system has many tools in their arsenal.   But what are these battles that they must win in the courts? And what tools do the courts have?  The issue I have with your commentary is that it glances over and avoids providing any substance to your position.

"Not completely.  The DC association could refuse to disbar, but the ABA has rules that most states (and DC) abide by, and if the attorneys are members, the DC bar's refusal won't carry much weight.  The state or region where the attorneys received their licenses to practice law will also have their own bar associations, and can disbar without relying on the DC bar's approval.  Moreover, if an attorney is disbarred *anywhere*, most states/regions/associations will honor that and enforce it, so the DC bar refusing would really only mean the attorneys would likely never be able to work anywhere *except* in DC, and no firm's going to hire someone who's been disbarred everywhere else, so that only leaves the DoJ... who they failed.  They'll end up shuffling papers or unemployed, most likely, even if the Bondi bro tries to protect them.  Disbarment really isn't something to screw around with.  License to practice law is like license to practice medicine, in that if your license is revoked in enough places, it's a black mark so bad that no-one trusts you to do it.",LuminaraCoH,2025-04-24T21:27:09,1
