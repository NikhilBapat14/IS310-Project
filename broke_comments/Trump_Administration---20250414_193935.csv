"Harvard has more than enough money and people lined up to pay them even more so they have zero need for taxpayer dollars anytime soon.   If this is the hill they want to die on, then best wishes and bless their hearts.",Key-Monk6159,2025-04-14T20:55:52,132
What does Harvard need 2.2 billion for?Â ,Reuters-no-bias-lol,2025-04-15T03:51:27,45
The federal government has announced a freeze on over $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts to Harvard University. The move follows the universityâ€™s refusal to comply with new directives issued by the Trump administration aimed at curbing campus activism and reforming internal policies.

"Go read this post on news or politics or any other sub and all the comments are,  how can he break the law like this, orange man bad, surely they will stop him, what are we to do...I'm willing to bet 98% of the people commenting didn't go to Harvard,  don't have any skin in the game and probably don't even know what he stopped funding for.  They are just whining and complaining because they have nothing better to do.    I don't care about Harvard or where they get their money from it. It doesn't matter to me. it doesn't change one thing in my life, so why oh why are they so offended? It doesn't effect them either",Wide_Fig3130,2025-04-14T22:11:14,-3

Who then charge massive fees to kids for useless underwater basket weaving degrees using federally backed student loans which they now want to *checks notes* completely forgive at the tax payer expense,icon0clast6,2025-04-15T15:06:30,4
"> 98% of the people commenting didn't go to Harvard  Oh, lol, I'm sure it's >99.999%.  Don't worry, I'm sure in their next comment, they're telling us how the billionaires are evil and should share their wealth.",bozoconnors,2025-04-15T08:02:38,5
