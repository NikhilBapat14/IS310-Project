"YES we have no idea how our own bodies work...thats the problem...not the fact that children impair our ability to be financially independant and retire with any dignity because it sets our career growth on fire because of our nations sexist parental care expectations, no national plan for PATERNITY and MATERNITY leave (and the expectation that both should take it) as well as failure to address the gender pay gap. Too many dads feel like they can write a check every month and be done with it when its no fun anymore, somehow we are still raising these, where's their education. Then theres the fact that even if both parent are fully committed the robber barrons have so stripped the system bare that you can't have a middle class life on one paycheck without someone giving up their future ( and often present) well being.

"I have to imagine that 9 out of 10 couples have figured out that raising a kid to adulthood most likely locks them out of home ownership for the rest of their lives and have decided to prioritize home ownership before trying for a kid. If the government took efforts to provide incentives to help with a first-time home purchase and incentivize building of more single-family homes, couples may feel more financially stable enough to pop out a couple of kids before fertility issues pop up.  A one time payment of $5000 is not a sufficient incentive to take on the significantly larger cost of raising a kid. It's condolences for getting knocked up.",KeviRun,2025-04-23T02:28:59,6

"A few years ago I (30sF) went on a date with a guy who was 31 and said he was giving himself ten years to decide if be wanted kids. I said that’s nice that he has that option, and that women don’t really have that luxury. He said “my mom was 41 when she had me”. I told him that was great but that for many women, it doesn’t work out that way, and that egg quantity and quality decline drastically over time. He said “well they can just do IVF!” and I mentioned that it’s really costly, hard on your body, and is not guaranteed to result in pregnancy, either. I also pointed out that as women age, there’s a higher risk of complications for both mother and baby.  After that conversation, I was curious about what men’s impression of female fertility was, so I asked a couple of male friends in their 30s what they thought/knew. They pretty much had the same outlook as the first guy.  Plenty of men who eventually want kids are out here acting like they’re Robert DeNiro and can wait until they’re 80 to become a dad, seemingly not even aware that sperm quality decreases over time and that advanced paternal age can lead to complications, as well. Women definitely have a much more limited timeline than men, but men shouldn’t be taking their fertility for granted either.  So, it seems like if anyone could benefit from classes that would help inform people with the goal of increasing the birth rate, maybe they should…teach men some things. Many of them seem to be in no hurry to have children.  I want to have children more than anything. I have tried to find a suitable partner, to no avail. Even if/when I find a partner, I’m unsure whether having a baby will financially possible. And FWIW, I also tried to have my eggs frozen, but it would’ve cost me $16k. The $5k they want to offer is laughable…is that supposed to go toward raising the child? Because with many insurance plans, that won’t even cover the cost of a baby being born. In summary, no, women don’t need a “menstrual class”.",Fresh_Ganache_743,2025-04-23T01:54:28,4
">Other possibilities include ... educating “women on their menstrual cycles and their ‘natural fertility,’ such as cycle-charting courses that many conservative Christian women use to try to prevent pregnancy without using birth control,”  Let me get this straight. We're going to teach the conservative Christian women how to use the worst possible birth control method so they can have more children anyway?

"> Minimum wage is supposed to be the bottom level, an entry point.  Minimum wage is supposed to be the bare minimum a person needs to support a family.   Don't believe me? Let's hear it from the man himself who championed, fought for, and eventually signed, minimum wage into law.   From Franklin D. Roosevelt himself:  >“It seems to me to be equally plain that no business which depends for existence on paying less than living wages to its workers has any right to continue in this country. By ""business"" I mean the whole of commerce as well as the whole of industry; by workers I mean all workers, the white collar class as well as the men in overalls; and by living wages I mean more than a bare subsistence level-I mean the wages of decent living.”  Oh, and if you think that doesn't mean what I said it means, here's another quote from him about it.   >Throughout industry, the change from starvation wages and starvation employment to living wages and sustained employment can, in large part, be made by an industrial covenant to which all employers shall subscribe. It is greatly to their interest to do this because decent living, widely spread among our people, eventually means the opening up to industry of the richest market which the world has known.  Still not convinced he meant a living wage? Here's another quote.  >On this idea, the first part of the Act proposes to our industry a great spontaneous cooperation to put millions of men back in their regular jobs this summer. The idea is simply for employers to hire more men to do the existing work by reducing the work-hours of each man's week and at the same time paying a living wage for the shorter week.   And before you bring up how it'd hurt companies for minimum wage to be a living wage; he addressed that argument too.   >No employer and no group of less than all employers in a single trade could do this alone and continue to live in business competition. But if all employers in each trade now band themselves faithfully in these modern guilds--without exception-and agree to act together and at once, none will be hurt and millions of workers, so long deprived of the right to earn their bread in the sweat of their labor, can raise their heads again.  But it'll raise prices you're going to cry. Don't worry, he had an answer for that too.  >I am fully aware that wage increases will eventually raise costs, but I ask that managements give first consideration to the improvement of operating figures by greatly increased sales to be expected from the rising purchasing power of the public. That is good economics and good business.  Edited to add more quotes.",Cat_herder_81,2025-04-22T20:32:39,19
