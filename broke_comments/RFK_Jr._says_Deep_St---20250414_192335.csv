"Q from QAnon said the Deep State was a cabal of pedos who existed for one reason and one reason only--to destroy Trump.  MAGA believes the Deep State is everyone who is not them.  Trump believes the Deep State is everyone who is not him and his immediate family. For a couple of decades the Heritage Foundation believed the Deep State are the unelected bureaucrats.  How come none of these people ever think that maybe they are the Deep State?  As an aside, going back a few decades, the far-left believed the Deep State was the corporations that really controlled government, or the Illuminati, One World Order, etc.  At least the far-left's concept was more believable.  There is some truth to RFK, Jr's comments here --business has been in the habit of wrapping itself around what-ever Fed Agency or Office it has direct ties to.  Kinda funny, though, considering who Trump currently has in his Administration.  I guess it is not the Deep State when it is out in the open?  Also, when RFK, Jr. was a kid, practically no-one was diagnosed with autism.  Back then, they just got labeled a problem child and sent off to boarding school, disciplined, etc. There is some talk these days about why so many children are now being diagnosed with some attributing it to better diagnostic tools and others saying that it is too easy these days and many are being diagnosed who otherwise should not be.  His comments about environmental toxins are kinda bizarre.  Not that they are wrong, but that they, along with other things that he says, goes counter to what Trump and his Admin are currently doing.  But also, he hasn't been doing much himself to clean the air and water.  I am pretty sure that Trump only tapped him because of his anti-vaxx stance as it is a middle finger to Dr. Fauci.",crucial_geek,2025-04-14T20:15:11,11

Bobbie Brainworms is definitely missing the rational  part of his brain the worms ate. I will be so relieved when felon Trump is impeached and these crazies go quiet again. America needs a break.,signerster,2025-04-15T06:15:19,1

Trump could have addressed the ‚Äúdeep state‚Äù in his first term but didn‚Äôt because it doesn‚Äôt exist. Playing the victim card as usual,Kind-City-2173,2025-04-15T20:09:13,1
"I agree with your view of why he was tapped. Possibly also for his name.   If there‚Äôs too much ties to industry, it‚Äôs born of GOP policies. (I‚Äôm specifically thinking of USDA, but I know it‚Äôs across departments, including rancher welfare on public lands. Fuck the Bundys and their ilk)",HippyGrrrl,2025-04-15T08:22:51,1
I think Trump and RFK Jr. made a backroom deal in 2024 when RFK Jr. dropped his independent candidacy for the Presidency and endorsed Trump. Control over Health and Human Services (including FDA) was the qui pro quo. The damage he will do to US healthcare may take decades -- if ever -- to fix.,Nerd-19958,2025-04-15T16:39:47,1

"Yeah, RFK, Jr. is a weird cat both literally and figuratively.  A good amount of what he is about appeals to lefties.  If he had his way, smoking, and things like Zyn, would be gone.  That affects MAGA.  His idea of having those with depression, anxiety, drug addictions, etc. stay and work on an organic farm is pure '70s hippy communism.  His insistence on toxins in the environment are spot on and straight out of the left side and a direct attack on the coal industry, among others.  Yeah, he has some BS beliefs, but I am telling you, the concept of 'autism is caused by vaccines' started on the farther-to-the-left.  His anti-vaxx stance is the only thing that resonates with MAGA, otherwise if he were dictator we would be getting rid of McDonalds, processed foods, soda, cars (mostly), and replace the food pyramid with organic kale, tofu, and grass fed, free-range, organ meats.  There is another ... I am too lazy at the moment to look her up but I want to say the new head of BLM .... who is a Dem.  Trump mentioned why he tapped, and in part, said that he was tossing the left a little something.",crucial_geek,2025-04-15T09:29:35,0
