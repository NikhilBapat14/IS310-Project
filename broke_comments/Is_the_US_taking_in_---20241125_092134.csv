"So this is purely subjective because how do you measure ""too many""? To someone who is xenophobic 1 is too many.   We could look at the economic standpoint. They don't pay federal taxes but pay other kinds. It is estimated that it may not necessarily cover what they cost our system  https://budget.house.gov/download/the-cost-of-illegal-immigration-to-taxpayers  That being said, they fill an incredibly important labor gap in America in construction and agriculture. We as a planet are getting more and more people who need to eat but have fewer farmers and America is no different.  https://www.bbc.com/future/bespoke/follow-the-food/the-reason-we-are-running-out-of-farmers/  https://www.fb.org/focus-on-agriculture/labor-shortages-continue-to-impact-farmers  And similar patterns in construction   https://www.abc.org/News-Media/News-Releases/abc-2024-construction-workforce-shortage-tops-half-a-million  So many undocumented immigrants are filling these gaps so you can argue that they are contributing to our economic growth in ways that aren't purely tax dollars.   For legal immigrants, I personally feel like a y cap we create is purely artificial. Most legal immigrants contribute to society and our economy. We often let students come to America, benefit from our education system then kick them out when their student visas expire so that they can improve the economy of their home country.  I would argue that we should be trying to get the best talent around the world to live in the USA.   So a lot of it is purely subjective",JayNotAtAll,2024-11-25T10:57:17,6

"Senate-elect Bernie Moreno revealed that we are spending over $100,000 every year on each illegal immigrant that comes to America.     From Breitbart.

"“So look, keep in mind, Mike, we flew some of these people here on private jets. We fly planes today to Venezuela, pick people up. If you were Maduro, who would you put on that plane? And by the way, when they get here, we spend $110,000 per illegal migrant per year,” Moreno said, revealing the shocking figures.       Im confused. Is he claiming the US goverment is importing foreign citizens and spies on planes of its own accord, breaking its own immigration laws and keeping them illegal, and then spends 100k per person on...what?",Kimzhal,2024-11-28T00:53:57,1
"That isn't even true, though. That's clearly a lie. Why would you just post what Moreno says and not any actual statistic?",[deleted],2024-11-28T09:27:51,0
"The claim that the government spends $100,000 annually on each undocumented immigrant is highly debated and depends on which costs are included in the analysis. Here’s a breakdown of relevant findings and factors that could align with higher estimates:  1. **Direct and Tangible Costs**: Studies often focus on costs associated with border enforcement, detention, education, and healthcare. For instance, detention costs alone averaged about $208 per immigrant detainee daily in 2018, amounting to roughly $75,920 annually. These figures exclude broader administrative and payroll costs, suggesting the actual cost might be higher when fully accounted for【16】. 2. **State and Local Expenses**: Costs for public education, healthcare, and shelter services are significant at the state and local levels. For example, New York City reported spending $383 daily for sheltering migrants, which extrapolates to $139,795 annually per person, factoring in emergency shelter and associated care【18】. 3. **Hidden or Indirect Costs**: Estimates often omit indirect costs, such as law enforcement, judicial proceedings, infrastructure impacts, and emergency services. For instance, incarceration of undocumented individuals in federal prisons cost an average of $39,158 annually per inmate in 2020, with additional judicial and police costs adding billions nationwide【17】. 4. **Broader Social Services**: Programs like language education, social work, childcare, and public assistance also add to the total cost. While not every individual incurs all these expenses, the cumulative burden on public resources can be substantial when applied across larger populations.",Bloodworks29,2024-11-29T20:37:36,1
