So tired of hearing this guy’s name. He’s a literal white nationalist and holds office.   Did everyone think he was gonna be clean?,ResidentFix5,2025-04-24T19:08:03,6
"Only reason for this is keeping his communications secret. He should resign, but I'm sure he'll just blame someone else, head to his powder room, and talk about how he's making the military muscular.",moldivore,2025-04-24T17:59:21,5
">”The Secretary of Defense's use of communications systems and channels is classified,"" said Parnell. ""However, we can confirm that the Secretary has never used and does not currently use Signal on his government computer.""  Except those times that he did.  But that was then. This is now. Can’t we just let bygones be bygones? And stop squabbling over what is “classified” or “top secret” or “not to be disseminated without proper clearance”? (/s)",swordrat720,2025-04-24T18:27:45,7

It almost seems fake how bad he is. What the fuck,Mlb_edu,2025-04-25T00:21:16,1
"That's just the Pentagon's way of saying Hegseth used a personal device, which is also typically disallowed in the secretary of defense's office, to use Signal and share classified information.",wonkalicious808,2025-04-24T20:27:37,2
"The Trump ""administration"" has openly just handed all of us over to the Russians, and half the country is totally o.k with that",LivingIndependence,2025-04-24T22:14:24,3
Have they tried just asking him for the meeting notice?,Gunningham,2025-04-25T00:29:40,1
"Yeah. He had an unauthorized device inside a SCIF. A civilian, former Army officer, should already know that it’s a very big no-no to do that. That he’s done it multiple times tells me that it’s deliberate, not a minor oops. A major whoopsie.",swordrat720,2025-04-24T22:33:28,1
