"A deal was not very fucking close  Trump will never ever help Ukraine, he wants revenge for them not doing his bullshit bidding against Biden",ElPlywood,2025-04-23T14:13:04,36
It was never close. They were never going to accept your terms of surrender.,RanRanBobanis,2025-04-23T14:12:38,21
"> Rubio and Witkoff's absence ""suggests that Washington is increasingly disinterested in drawn-out, multilateral negotiations,"" N√©meth added. ""This is not just about diplomacy fatigue. It also signals a hard pivot: The U.S. is not positioning itself as a neutral mediator.""  Trump is a corrupt embarrassment at every turn.",IRideMoreThanYou,2025-04-23T14:13:22,22
Trump wanted Ukraine to surrender to Russia. That‚Äôs not a deal.,Ancient_Popcorn,2025-04-23T14:17:35,18
Trump is that toddler who makes up random stuff and expects the grown ups to be impressed.,DavidBehave01,2025-04-23T14:17:34,11
"It's getting depressive as shit that a lot of my thoughts keep coming down to ""Oh f*** off Trump.""   I just, I want a normal world lol.",JuliButt,2025-04-23T14:13:06,10
Art of the Steal. Trump practically bullying Zelensky to give up his country. Thankfully the Ukrainian president has something Trump and his minions will never have: a spine,hyborians,2025-04-23T14:20:45,9
"The Russian demand is that Ukraine should leave entire regions that are not even controlled by Russia, including big cities like Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, with a million inhabitants taken together. This is what the Americans support, and claim the Ukrainians are ‚Äùsabotaging‚Äù the deal by not being as enthusiastic about it as the Fascist allies are‚Ä¶",fabe1haft,2025-04-23T14:53:32,5
"Sure, it was close, as long as Ukraine gives up Crimea and all the land Putin has grabbed so far. smh",JFJinCO,2025-04-23T14:17:39,5
It was as close as the trade deal is with China...,Someguy2189,2025-04-23T14:18:26,4
Why doesn't Trump publicly state what Russia wants to end the war? Never any criticism of Putin.,mces97,2025-04-23T14:22:01,3
of course Trump wants piece for Ukraine,jungstir,2025-04-23T14:17:56,2
"Once again....If I go into your backyard, and claim your garden shed and a large plot of land around it as my own, what are you going to do?  If you answer isn't ""fight back, it's my land"" then you are part of the problem.",ERedfieldh,2025-04-23T14:49:28,2
trump really is going if you dont give yourself up to russia we walk away from you and your on your own deal thing huh,saiyanscaris,2025-04-23T16:09:51,2
"Every time Trump opens his mouth all he has to offer are blatant lies and total nonsense.  For anyone who hates America and wants to see the country in total ruins, Trump has to be the dream-come-true president.",crazybones,2025-04-23T14:27:51,1
"Neither Trump nor Putin have anything they are willing to offer to end the war. When the recent ceasefire looks the same as the war itself, there‚Äôs no reason to accept anything.",ranchoparksteve,2025-04-23T14:28:04,1
"I think the only deal that was ever close is the one that involves only U.S. and Russia; the bilateral agreements between the two. There was nothing remotely close about ending the overall war.   The U.S. will likely still make some agreements about the US trade with Russia, and this will be done without the approval of Ukraine or the Europeans at large. I think that was the goal all along and this is why they were not initially invited to participate.",PsychLegalMind,2025-04-23T14:29:30,1
That's not how deals work.,twovles31,2025-04-23T14:30:22,1
"Screw trump/rubio. Sanction the $hit out of Putin and any country that does business with him. Do not reward land theft, kidnapping, and other crimes.",C_Kent_,2025-04-23T14:38:22,1
Shut the fuck up you compulsive liar and snowflake.,Im_gumby_damnit,2025-04-23T14:41:12,1
"This is why Biden was grinding Russia down. We all know this won't work for a mountain of reasons. Not least of which are the outrageous demands from Russia & their utter lack of trustworthiness. Marc, J.D. & Donnie are a bunch of clowns.¬†",Competitive-Bike-277,2025-04-23T14:45:14,1
Russia needs to draw back to Ukraine's original 2014 borders.....Ukraine should accept nothing less,phaedrag,2025-04-23T16:01:57,1
Obviously wasn't ü§£,broc_ariums,2025-04-23T16:35:55,1
this is the lens.  It's all revenge,Holden_Coalfield,2025-04-23T14:32:08,8
Diplomacy fatigue? Don't you have to try something before you declare that you're burned out?,Grandpa_No,2025-04-23T14:23:16,5
