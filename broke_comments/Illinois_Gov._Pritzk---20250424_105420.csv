"Excerpt:  *CHICAGO, Ill. (WTVO) — Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker announced that the state will take punitive actions against the country of El Salvador for holding Kilmar Abrego Garcia in custody.*  *“The United States Constitution guarantees due process. We are witnessing Donald Trump erode our fundamental Constitutional rights in real time, and we must fight to restore the balance of power,” said Pritzker. “The State of Illinois will stand up for the Rule of Law and do everything in our power stop the Trump Administration from ripping apart our most basic rights.”*  ...  *Pritzker has asked the Illinois State Board of Investment, the State Universities Retirement System, and the Teachers’ Retirement System to review any investments in companies controlled by El Salvador, with the purpose of withholding investments in those companies. The Governor is also directing the Illinois Department of Central Management Services to identify state contracts with companies that are controlled by El Salvador, with the purpose of stopping them. And, Pritzker wants the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity Office of Trade and Investment to send in an analysis of the scale of trade El Salvador has with Illinois.*  *The action comes as the outspoken Illinois governor positions himself in global affairs, which have included signing trade agreements with the State of Mexico and the United Kingdom, efforts that critics say point to a possible 2028 presidential run.*",DevinGraysonShirk,2025-04-24T10:55:45,106

I'm so glad he's my governor. We need our political leaders to stand up and call out Trump's bullshit loudly. It really sucks that there are so few willing to tell Trump to fuck off (in so many words).,I_Hate_Consulting,2025-04-24T11:11:30,43
">“The United States Constitution guarantees due process. We are witnessing Donald Trump erode our fundamental Constitutional rights in real time, and we must fight to restore the balance of power.”  It's truly sickening. Hearing about how the White House actually *claimed* they couldn't retrieve Kilmar Abrego after deporting him... that's just layers upon layers of outrageousness. And the Supreme Court ordering the Trump administration to facilitate his return, yet they still messed it up, it's a strong reminder of how easily our constitutional rights are threatened, and, of course, the fact that they really tried to pull one over on us. Pritzker stepping in is a small thing, but it's better than nothing. I mean, something *has* to be done. It's just... infuriating.

"> I wish I could do more to help.  Be politically active and talk to people! My method of activism is trying to share news to keep people informed. Recently, I've been sharing Pritzker news and Newsom news because I think they are the potential leaders of the Democrats, along with AOC.   We really, really need a civic revival in the United States, too many people are uninformed and/or are in bubbles. The Republicans are also trying to build an alternate reality with fake news and lies and hatred. Vulnerable people are at risk of being hurt, or worse. It's all hands on deck!

"Yeah, and this is all even more hilarious to me, because my constitutional rights have been violated here in the county where I live for more than 11 full consecutive uninterrupted years on one occasion, and they have been violated numerous other times as well. I’ve reported it hundreds of times and been trying to do something about it for years, but even the board of supervisors just won’t listen to me when I tell them they are acting in violation of the constitution and various federal court decisions. So I’m sure it’s just happening everywhere and the fact that it’s now happening at the highest level in the nation is just an extension of that. All the people who complained about their rights being violated probably feel at least slightly vindicated right now. If only they had been listened to. This is what happens when you take power away from the people and make it impossible to defend yourself before the damage has been done. We don’t need police officers. We need citizens who are willing and able to stand up for themselves whenever necessary so tyranny can never take hold.",squallomp,2025-04-24T11:26:15,1

"Yeah glorifying (most of) the founding fathers might be a step too far for me, Lafayette was pretty based though.  There is a middle ground though, ""be compassionate to people and ruthless to systems"" to quote the late, great, Michael Brooks.  The thing is, is that the decision to concede at least something to progressive politics shouldn't even be ""altruistic"" it should be entirely pragmatic, or you would think, anyways. ""We can either give them a little to keep them from taking a lot, or we can give them nothing and they'll kill us."" Is a pretty clear choice in my mind. I guess the reasoning is ""If we cave now it's a slow death, better to smash it before it gains momentum."" But that seems like a never ending game of whack-a-socialist and eventually the system you're protecting kills you anyways.  To be clear, I like to think I know when and when not to look the gift horse in the mouth, usually when it's made of wood and full of Greeks bent on killing you. Which pritzker, does not seem to be. If I had to guess he's probably more in line with the FDR old school progressive Democrats than he can market himself as comfortably, but he seems pretty genuine in his principles.  You know what, I take that back, I don't think Pritzker is uncomfortable running quite a bit further to the left of the average party member at all, I don't know his position on Israel, I do know hes Jewish, but if its not ""send 80 trillion dollars to Israel and as much zyklon B as they want"" he's pretty much a slam fucking dunk. His domestic politics seem to be pretty much impeccable for a Democrat, and even as governor he's managing to signal that he's on the right side foreign policy wise as well.  This is how Democrats win back the working class, hard nosed domestic policy that actually improves people's lives, and not supporting every genocidal freak we can find abroad.",Grotesque_Bisque,2025-04-24T17:46:05,1
"So you admit your not paying attention and only receptive to sound bites that show in your tiktok but moan they should 'do more', because all you get are 'tik tok' sound bites.

Even just keeping these things in the news is more than most.  Like I said, give your complaints to those who you are not hearing ANYTHING about -- even your sound bites. Those are the ones that aren't doing enough. She's a junior member....she's one of the younger entrants. Where the fuck has Pelosi been as one of the most senior members that exists?  You have Crockett, AOC, Bernie particularly being very active and getting 'sound bites' but then guess you also think they should 'do more' since you only see the 'tik toks'?
