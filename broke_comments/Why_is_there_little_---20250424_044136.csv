Our school systems have to provide food for children because they are so neglected at home that they don't get fed.,AppState1981,2025-04-24T06:21:37,30
"Some people absolutely are not responsible enough to have children. Unfortunately, it is completely morally and ethically wrong to screen for these people before they have kids so our only line of defense is to intervene when the kid is suffering. They are not only just doing their job. This is an underpaid disrespected line of work. Social workers deserve more pay then they are getting and way more respect. Sounds like you did something and are upset about being held accountable for your actions. Maybe look in the mirror first and actually be honest to why you are constantly interacting with CPS.",edgyteen03911,2025-04-24T09:49:27,26

"Just because it isn't posted doesn't mean that Conservatives don't care. It just hasn't come up.  It is possible for people to care about a lot of things at once.  So instead being accusatory and looking for a fight, try bringing up the subject for rational and thoughtful discussion.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-24T05:07:56,25
"I could do like others in this thread and protest our innocence and how we do care but it just hasn't risen to the top of our radar...  *But from your tone and responses to others in here it's clear you aren't here in good faith, but are just looking to pick a fight, so why should I respond in good faith?*  So instead I'll just say, **begone concern troll trying to astroturf an issue into existence.** And leave it at that.  Don't expect any further responses because I can already tell that your response will not warrant them.",Shadeylark,2025-04-24T06:42:11,14

Biggest things first.  Nationwide this isn’t a terribly common problem compared to all the other things going on.,dottedoctet,2025-04-24T09:10:06,7
"I'm not accusing r/conservatism of snuffing the issue. I'm simply asking for an organic reason that there's no discussion of this issue on Reddit as a whole besides 'it didn't come up'. I'm 100 percent certain there are many people on here that have had their lives impacted by DHR. I'm simply encouraging them to speak up. Or, if Reddit snuffs my post, I'll know that it is not organic and many posts like this exist, deleted.",aliislam_sharun,2025-04-24T05:30:12,-1
"But it is still a problem. I remember 35 years ago in Florida, they had a tip line that was allowed to be anonymous to call in on someone abusing kids. I saw first hand how it affected a friend who, I know for a fact since I was living with them as a roommate for awhile. I even told the Police that showed up that it was a lie. It took over a year to find the ""Anonymous"" person who claimed my friends were abusing their kids, my testimony and a ton of money to get their kids back.  No different than these red laws on guns. Or some idiot who swatts someone.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-24T09:51:41,1
"Bring it up yourself... without being confrontational.  Why hasn't anyone on Conservative brought up the persecution of the Monks in China? Why hasn't anyone brought up this or that.  Instead of starting by saying WHY, why not just bring up the issue and see where the discussion leads. You title assumes no one cares and creates a confrontational start.  You could have just said something like... DHS/CPS is breaking up families and then go on to explain what you are getting at and begin a conversation. When you attack from the headline you create a negative rather than a positive. Sorry if you can't see that.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-24T05:50:46,33
Because it literally doesn’t come up,plitspidter,2025-04-24T05:44:39,14
"""organic reason that there's no discussion of this issue on Reddit""  It's largely a State rather than a federal issue with investigations and termination of parental rights being done at the State level.  Parental rights are an issue here, see the recent posts about the US Supreme Court taking up the ""Puppy Pride"" case.  If you have specific cases from the media that you want to bring up post them.",49thbotdivision,2025-04-24T17:50:38,1
I agree it’s still an issue. But frankly it doesn’t make the top 200 right now. That’s why it’s not being discussed.,dottedoctet,2025-04-24T10:17:41,3
"Well it has now, are you going to actually discuss it or just shit on my post? I'm sorry that parents having their children wrongfully taken from them without due process isn't a big enough issue for you.",aliislam_sharun,2025-04-24T05:50:20,-22
Which I can understand to a point the OPs headline. Even if I don't agree how he presented it.,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-24T10:22:07,2
"People are more likely to just shit on your post simply for the WAY you brought it up. Your post screams you are trying to pick a fight. This entire post could have been phrased ""What is your opinion on {insert topic here}?"" And it would have received far less criticism than you essentially saying ""Why don't you guys care about X?!?""  Yes, it's an issue. However I feel that there are far more kids removed from actual harmful environments than there are wrongfully removed from their families without due process.",Rocket_Surgery83,2025-04-24T08:30:22,6
