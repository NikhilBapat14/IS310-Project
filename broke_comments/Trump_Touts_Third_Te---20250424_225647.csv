"As per [original article](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2025/04/25/trump-2028-hats-merchandise-president-third-term/) 📰:  - Donald Trump is selling merchandise with the slogan “Trump 2028” in a nod to a potential White House run that is banned under the US Constitution.  The US president’s official website is offering his popular red hats along with T-shirts and can coolers that feature the slogan. The T-shirts also include the phrase “rewrite the rules” in brackets.  Mr Trump would be barred from serving more than two terms as president under the Constitution’s 22nd amendment, which expressly forbids it.  Despite this, Mr Trump, 78, said he is considering running for a third term, telling NBC in March that he was “not joking” about his ambitions and that “there are methods” for him to do it.  The two-term limit was an unwritten tradition dating back to George Washington, the nation’s first president, who famously decided not to seek a third term because he said he did not want the new country to be a monarchy.  The country’s presidents largely followed that tradition until Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the 32nd president, who served three full terms in office before he died a few months into his fourth term in 1945.  A two-term limit was then formalised in 1951 with the 22nd amendment, which states that “no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice”.  However, many of Mr Trump’s supporters have encouraged him to run again in 2028.   Steve Bannon, a former chief strategist for several months of Mr Trump’s first term, told News Nation last month that the president will “run and win again in 2028”.  A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday showed a slim majority of Republicans think the president should not seek a third term. Three quarters of respondents said he should not run again.  But even among Republican politicians, the idea of a third term is growing in popularity. Tennessee representative Andy Ogles has introduced a resolution in the House of Representatives to amend the Constitution so Mr Trump could serve again.  However, the proposal is unlikely to succeed because of the high threshold to enact it – a two-thirds majority of both the US House and Senate must approve it, and then three quarters of state legislatures must ratify it.  Despite these barriers, Mr Trump and his Maga allies appear to be cashing in on the idea.  His second son, Eric, posted a link to the merchandise on his X account along with a picture of the “Trump 2028” T-shirt. Eric was also pictured wearing the new red hat.  Earlier this month Mr Trump said he would “love” to challenge Barack Obama, who is also constitutionally barred from running after serving two terms.  When asked by a reporter if he would run against Mr Obama if the former president sought a third term, Mr Trump said, “I love that, that would be a good one. I’d like that.  “I never looked into it. They do say there’s a way you can do it. But I don’t know about that.”  He continued: “I have not looked into it. I want to do a fantastic job. We have four years, just about almost close to four years, and some time is flying, but it’s still close to four years, and we’re getting a lot of credit for having done a great job in the first almost 100 days.”  Legal experts have suggested there are a number of potential avenues to get around the 22nd amendment, including JD Vance, the US vice-president, nominating Mr Trump as his vice-president and then stepping aside for him",T_Shurt,2025-04-24T22:58:11,1
