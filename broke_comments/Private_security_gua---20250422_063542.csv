Good. They need to be held accountable for the way they treated her.,invalidpassword,2025-04-22T06:43:07,204
The party of Law and Order is dragging the constitution out to the street one person at a time.,animalslover4569,2025-04-22T06:49:37,104

"Verbiage is not a justification for use of force.  It may not go this way, but this is a textbook example of what is NOT reasonable force.    Town Hall Meetings may become loud, but shouting is NOT use of force (provided that the person is not making threats, of course).  The ONLY justification for a LEO becoming involved is if someone is acting in a way that gives a reasonable person cause to fear for their safety.    Being vocal at a Town Hall Meeting is covered under the First Amendment.  If you don't like what someone is saying (no matter how loudly) you are free to cover your ears.  Sticks & stones are justification for force (or threats of use of sticks & stones & fire etc); words aren't.  The education level of US Law Enforcement is beyond utterly dismal.  They do not seem to have even a remedial level of legal comprehension.",Huge-Platypus9075,2025-04-22T07:59:59,71
Is this the woman who got dragged out for saying “Cowards”?  Because that’s fucked up.,EFCFrost,2025-04-22T09:04:10,22
"‘Disruptive behavior will not be tolerated and will result in removal’.  The warning on MTG’s website before her town hall last week.  Ohhhh, the irony.",Igotthesilver,2025-04-22T09:32:36,19
You are allowed anger in a democracy. You're allowed to shout at your elected officials.,Kaiisim,2025-04-22T09:38:08,11
The cop who started it is not mentioned in this article. He should be charged as well.,Doasadi-anu,2025-04-22T12:43:15,6

She was only removed so forcibly because she forgot to say “Thank You.”,Fiendguy18,2025-04-22T12:45:23,1
"Newsmax is spinning it as a ""private political meeting"" and not a town hall, insinuating that she ""lied to the courts"". Cant fucking stand conservative media and my whole family buys into the faux news/newsmax bullshit.",TataraSoul,2025-04-24T16:25:55,1
"I mean, not really? You have the right to express yourself, sure. But most states have a disorderly conduct statute that prohibits conduct that a reasonable person would not find permissable. Generally the law supports action against speech if it regards the unreasonable conduct in which it is expressed versus the content of the speech.  That goes twofold if it's hosted at a location on private property, then you have trespass statutes that can be used as well.",gunsandgardening,2025-04-22T08:13:56,-34
This isn’t true lol.  You cannot go into town hall meetings and do whatever you want and expect no consequences lol.,Electrical_Cancel169,2025-04-22T08:37:22,-32
I’d argue that her town hall was even worse. A man simply stood up with a sign about insider trading and was dragged out by four cops and then thrown to the floor and held down while he was tazed multiple times. His screams were hard to listen to.,WhiteClawandDraw,2025-04-22T10:42:26,18
Howler monkey says what?,appleandorangutan,2025-04-22T10:42:47,4
"It seems she was specifically targeted in this case since she ran against the republicans in the area as others were also being loud.   Then law enforcement sent security guards to get her. It doesn’t really work that way. Law enforcement can’t direct private citizens to do their job arresting and detaining. If the sheriff removed her fine, but not here, at all.",ShowMeSomethingKool,2025-04-22T09:02:38,30
"The consequence is getting tresspassed by the police, it's a paperwork thing. Not dragged out by people with no authority to do so.",icecoldrootbeer,2025-04-22T09:19:18,24
"This is how you end up with charges against you and a civil suit seeking millions of dollars. I encourage the low functioning to continue to do these things, it makes it easier to ruin them. If they don't misstep, you can't ruin them.  ""Please proceed.""",toomuchtodotoday,2025-04-22T10:32:29,4
"Yeah, I worked as a security guard and we can't touch someone unless a few factors happen; medical emergency, self-defense or defense of others (breaking up a fight, etc). It's one thing to escort someone out, but dragging them needs to be done by the actual police.  Was this on private property? I can't recall if the article said as much. If you ask someone to leave and they won't,  you can tresspas them. A lot of people don't understand that private property is still private even if owned by a business.",starbucks77,2025-04-22T12:03:00,4
 Can’t be trespassed on public property without breaking a law first.,CompetitiveArt9639,2025-04-22T17:30:15,2
They most definitely can trespass them in that case. But the whole thing about the sheriff instructing security to do it is backwards. Sheriff should have done it.,ShowMeSomethingKool,2025-04-22T12:05:19,3
