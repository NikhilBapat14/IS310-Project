Once upon a time this would be seen by all americans as spitting in the face of the country as a whole.  Not any more.,TintedApostle,2025-04-22T19:21:13,16
"Introduce a bill repealing the alien enemies act. Sweeten the pot with funding for more legitimate deportation courts to get buy-in. If Republicans refuse that deal it will hurt them down the road. Don't just copy-cat Van Hollen, who had an actual reason to go there.  Hell, if you want to grandstand, introduce a congressional declaration of war bill against El Salvador. It won't pass but it will get a lot of attention.  The legislature has far more power than the courts do.",[deleted],2025-04-22T19:40:44,6

">Hell, if you want to grandstand, introduce a congressional declaration of war bill against El Salvador.  If anyone did that, the maga GOP would go ape shit declaring war on any country that criticizes the dear leader.",Ouibeaux,2025-04-22T20:34:48,1

"El Salvador declared a state of emergency due to gang violence and began imprisoning anyone with gang tattoos.  The US declared a state of emergency due to immigrant gang violence and began renditioning people to El Salvador paying them to hold them under local law.  The courts are telling the government ""That's not how this works"" but law only exists when the men with guns enforce it. Which is why the founders gave us the first amendment, to yell at them to do their jobs. And why they gave us the second amendment, to post cool photos on instagram and hunt deer.",[deleted],2025-04-22T20:40:48,3
None of those bills would get passed. But there are multiple things I could think of that dems could offer in return for striking down AEA that the GOP wouldn't dare turn down.,[deleted],2025-04-22T20:45:31,2
