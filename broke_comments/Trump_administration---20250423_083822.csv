"The Trump administration has been engaged in a concerted effort to undo initiatives aimed at holding Russia and its leaders and allies accountable for alleged war crimes in Ukraine.  Since taking office, the administration has moved to withdraw from an international group led by the European Union that was created to punish Moscow for violating international law in its invasion of Ukraine. The White House has also reduced the work of the Justice Department’s [War Crimes Accountability Team](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-visits-ukraine-reaffirms-us-commitment-help-identify) and dismantled a program to seize assets of sanctioned Russian oligarchs.  And in a previously unreported move, it has vacated a coordinator position — mandated by law — to gather intelligence from across the government on Russian atrocities committed in Ukraine, according to two people familiar with the matter, who like others interviewed for this story spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the matter’s sensitivity.

I really can't think of anything someone who was 100% under Putin's control would do differently than what trump is doing.,SpareLiver,2025-04-23T08:41:32,7
"POTUS Pyotr Krasnov.  We have complete proof, beyond reasonable doubt, that our current ""POTUS"" is an asset of Moscow's FSB.  The Democrats are playing their part by sitting on their hands (with a few honorable exceptions) and must be considered now as part of the problem.  The time has come to end the two party system, fire almost all incumbent politicians and start over.  The system has comprehensively failed.",Huge-Platypus9075,2025-04-23T08:44:06,3

Anyone get the feeling that the USA is The Empire in Star Wars?,Tso-su-Mi,2025-04-23T09:49:55,1
"This type of investigative actions are certainly useful political pressure tools but only become meaningful if the leadership loses the actual war that gave rise to the charges. Otherwise, it is impossible to hold the leadership criminally accountable.  Particularly war crimes.   As for Trump administration, they have taken multiple actions to soften Putin into making a deal with Russia to end the war. It seems unlikely the war will end soon. Even if U.S. ultimately withdraws all support so long as EU continues its support the war will likely go on until the warring parties are exhausted or one side loses.",PsychLegalMind,2025-04-23T08:55:44,1
"And we haven’t even mentioned the fact the Democrats are, like republicans, a pro-genocide party paying for and materially supporting the violent oppression and systematic elimination of Palestinians.",Bitter-Holiday1311,2025-04-23T09:34:27,0
"US has taken actions to soften  Putin? How so? Seems like any actions taken by the US have been designed to facilitate formal recognition of seized Crimea and allow Russia to keep territory it currently, and illegally, occupies.  How is that softening Putin?",Bitter-Holiday1311,2025-04-23T09:32:50,1
"Sadly, frustration at the flabby response by the Democrats to the horrible events in the Near East helped re-elect Cheeto Hitler.  It seems to me (& please take what you like & leave the rest) that we CANNOT have our politicians address issues beyond the USA until we focus on the Elephant In The Room.  The USA MUST embrace Democracy and grant comprehensive suffarage to the 4,000,000 plus Citizens of The USA who are disenfranchised.  Only then can we work toward electing politicians who heed the will of the people.  Schumerite Centerism will not only doom Palestine; it will doom the USA too.  Until then, we MUST put the Horse Before The Cart.  As it stands, Palestine is an issue that will contribute toward turning the USA into a fully-fledged Fascist Autocracy.",Huge-Platypus9075,2025-04-23T09:41:46,3
