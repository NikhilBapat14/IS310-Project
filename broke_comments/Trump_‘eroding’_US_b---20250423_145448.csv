"US President Donald Trump is moving too fast, alienating allies, making Americans poorer, and tarnishing the sterling reputation of US assets, Citadel CEO and founder Ken Griffin said Wednesday.  Though the president may have identified real problems, his methods to solve them don’t appear to be working, and are unlikely to revive American manufacturing, Griffin told Semafor’s Gina Chon at the World Economy Summit in Washington, DC.  Previously, Griffin said, “no brand compared” to US Treasurys, the strength of the US dollar, or the nation’s creditworthiness. But Trump’s tactics have “eroded” that reputation.  “We put that brand at risk,” the billionaire hedge fund manager said. “It can be a lifetime to repair the damage that has been done.”  Investors have dumped US stocks and Treasurys in recent weeks in response to Trump’s on-again, off-again tariffs on imports to the US. While most countries have been granted a 90-day reprieve, Trump has increased duties on China and suggested he might fire Jerome Powell, the respected governor of the US Federal Reserve. (Trump walked back those comments, saying he has no plans to remove Powell.)  Using the euro as a reference, the US “has become 20% poorer in four weeks,” Griffin said, an environment that produces no winners or bright spots.  “There’s no great opportunity when the pie is rapidly shrinking,” Griffin said. “All you’re trying to do is tread water and not drown.”  [Read the full story here.](https://www.semafor.com/article/04/23/2025/citadel-ceo-ken-griffin-trump-is-eroding-us-brand-and-making-the-country-poorer?utm_campaign=semaforreddit)",semafornews,2025-04-23T14:55:20,111
"  >""The major problem, one of the major problems, for there are several, with governing people is that of who you get to do it. Or, rather of who manages to get people to let them do it to them.

"Oh, now this is rich — literally. When Ken Griffin, the mega-billionaire behind Citadel — the same Citadel that treats retail investors like chew toys — steps up and says Trump made the country 20% poorer and is eroding the U.S. brand, you know it’s bad.  This is like the villain in a movie pausing mid-monologue to go, “Wait, this guy’s nuts.” Ken Griffin, who could probably buy a small planet and was out here trying to scoop up the Miami Dolphins like it’s a casual Zillow search, is telling us Trump is tanking the country’s value like it’s a meme stock gone wrong. And he would know — because Citadel specializes in chaos.  Let’s be real. Citadel is basically the dark web of Wall Street in broad daylight. Market manipulation? Check. Conflicts of interest? All day. Payment for order flow? Oh, they practically invented that scam. Retail investors get bodied while Citadel’s front-running trades, shaving pennies off your every move, flipping them into yachts and art auctions. And they’ve paid fines. Big ones. SEC violations like it’s an annual subscription. Yet they keep raking it in, laughing from the top of the algorithm tower.  So when that guy — the one who turned the 2021 GameStop drama into a hedge fund Super Bowl — says Trump is breaking the economy, it’s like hearing Gordon Ramsay walk out of a kitchen and say, “This place is unsavable.”  Trump has been out here torching the American brand like it’s a failed steakhouse. He’s alienated allies, sabotaged supply chains, turned tariffs into political tantrums, and reduced global trust to zero. He didn’t just make America 20% poorer in GDP — he made us 80% dumber in global reputation. No one wants to partner with the country being run like a Truth Social comment thread.  And the irony? This entire mess was built for people like Ken Griffin. The tax cuts, deregulation, the looting of government for the rich — all tailor-made for billionaires. But even Ken is looking around like, “Nah, this is too corrupt. Y’all wildin’.”  So when the guy who games the system to this degree publicly says “Trump is the problem,” it’s not a wake-up call. It’s a damn siren. Because if Citadel thinks the economy is being driven into a ditch, then the rest of us are already in the trunk, wondering why it got dark so fast.",Hercules1579,2025-04-23T18:41:52,17

"""Brand identity"" could be approached two ways.    You could provide a quality product, build goodwill and business relationships.  Treat business as a cooperative endeavour to elevate industry and quality of life.  You provide a good product - you receive a fair premium for it.  You trade on your name.  Alternatively, you can always look to make the largest sum of money from every deal; build shitty, develop contempt for both your own product and your own customer to justify your worldview.  Rather than goodwill, you stifle bad press with rabid lawyers and aggressive and manipulative marketing.  People said Trump would bring his business acumen to politics, and he has.  The product is governance and he is in the process of cutting every corner whilst gilding it for racists with cheap gold foil.  He has made the US government tacky and unfit for purpose; but he's been elected.  He already has your money.

"So, if you make stock buybacks illegal again like they were before Ronald Ragen, companies would no longer put all of their profit revenue into buybacks to manipulate stock prices, which would provide a more accurate stock valuation.    With corporation tax reform, the federal corporate tax rate could be raised from the current 21% to lets say 45%. corporations could avoid this high tax rate by using reinvestment write-off incentives structured to allow companies to write off large portions of revenue based on how much they reinvest in their company. This could include modernizing, providing pro-worker conditions, pensions, salary raises, local community investments, etc. These corporate contributions should give tax relief, acknowledgment, and should be celebration; everyone likes that pat on the back, especially the wealthy.   Reinvestment into company grow would hopefully produce in better quality products, possilbliy better tailored to foreign markets ( looking at you auto industry ). This shift would take time but it also takes time to set up manufacturing too.   Also, the federal government should emphasize the protection of domestic intellectual property, and data security by subsidizing the cost of robust cybersecurity teams. If the the theaft of intellectual property is so important.    These types of policy changes would fundamentally change the way we approach finance and would have an adjustment period, but they would contribute to long-term economic and societal change, at least in my view. Sadly, this all hinges on public trust in the government, high government efficiency, and collective unity to make these things happen, and that's not happening anytime soon.  The finance sector of the United States at this point has turned every other industry into their own personal atm.

"So, I think you’re slightly off on the buyback issue.  It’s not so much about manipulation of stock prices it’s that if the company is sitting on enough excess cash the shareholders will push it to distribute dividends…which are then taxed.  A buyback effectively pro-rata increases the share price, but not the market cap.  Valuation is the market cap, not the price of the shares*  An analogy just in case others might not follow:  I have a pie (company in this case), and it’s split into 100 pieces (shares), and each share trades for $1.00, then the pie is worth $100.  Now, let’s say I, as a company, have excess cash of $10.  I can do one of three things:  1. If I have a great investment idea I can just reinvest it into the business.  That reinvestment creates growth potential - maybe, depends on a LOT of things.  2. I can issue a dividend of 0.10 to all my 100 shareholders ($0.10 * 100 share holders = $10).  Let’s say all 100 share holders are long term capital gains holders in the US, so they then owe $0.02 of their $0.10 dividend as long term capital gains taxes.  (For all you tax nerds, leave me alone I’m trying to not make this any more complicated than it is.  So in the end the US Treasury gets $2 and shareholders get $8.  3. I can buy back some allotment of stock usually at a premium.  For the sake of very easy numbers let’s say I have an excess of $10 and I offer $1.25 to buy back up to 8 shares and all 8 are sold.  (The mechanics of how this works doesn’t actually matter for the point of this post).  Then, I retire those shares.  So now I have a company that is still worth $100, but there are only 92 slices remaining.  So each of the remaining shares are now worth $1.08.  The pie didn’t change in size, we just changed the number of slices of the pie.   *Market cap = number of shares outstanding * share price ** Bonus extra = in the most basic terms the value of a company is an estimation of the present value of its future cash flows and the share price is just that present value divided by the number of shares outstanding.  Where things get very messy is whatever that estimation of future cash flows is.  If you’re talking about a company like Costco well then that’s kinda more predictable than let’s say Amazon (I picked it just because it’s a wildly complex business with lots of moving pieces each with their own growth forecasts)",cryingproductguy,2025-04-23T23:29:50,5
