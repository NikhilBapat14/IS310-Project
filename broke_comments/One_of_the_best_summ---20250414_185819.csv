"This summary is incorrect in the first sentence. He was not in the country legally. He was an illegal alien with a withholding of removal, which can only be granted once an alien has been ordered removed. Basically, the government wanted to deport him but opted to hold off on it due to conditions in his home country. They could have removed him to a different country, or revoked his withholding of removal based on conditions changing in his home country. Having a withholding of removal is different from having asylum and doesn't allow the alien to adjust status towards getting more permanent residence or citizenship.   Edit: reading the rest of it anyway despite my issue with the first sentence, it is a pretty comprehensive analysis.   Edit 2: wait a fucking minute, this guys Withholding of Removal only said that he couldn't be removed to Guatemala? And now he's been removed to his native El Salvador? What's the issue?",Mountain_Man_88,2025-04-14T20:34:51,29

"First sentence is by the NYT and of course they lied.  The left wing narrative of this is based on making people believe he was here legally and 'hadn't broken any laws'.  He was here illegally and therefore had broken the laws of the United States.  And one more time for our Leftist friends - dude is found to be, not once but twice, a member of MS-13.",Merax75,2025-04-14T23:03:03,8
> the New York Times reported: “A Maryland man who was in the United States legally was deported to El Salvador and imprisoned there because of an ‘administrative error.’”   No. That's absolutely correct.,Critical_Concert_689,2025-04-14T20:46:19,-11
"And by virtue of being here illegally, he was either smuggled here and paid a coyote, thus paying the cartel, or he came here legally and betrayed the trust of the United States by remaining longer than authorized.",Mountain_Man_88,2025-04-14T23:36:23,7
"I guess it's true that the New York Times reported it, but what they reported isn't true. The author lists that claim among ""facts"" that are largely undisputed.",Mountain_Man_88,2025-04-14T20:52:59,20
"He, for one, isn't a Maryland man. He was also here illegally. No, he did not have asylum or anything like that. What the hell is so hard to understand in all of this?",Wide_Fig3130,2025-04-14T23:29:51,7
