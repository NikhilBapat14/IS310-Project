"They realized midterms are next year. They have a slim majority and their current actions have been blatantly anti-constitutional and have ignored their constituents.

GOP needs to try and consolidate power.  Do NOT forget who supported what!  They don‚Äôt deserve to represent us after giving allegiance to 47.  They would‚Äôve done better under the threat of primary,MessMysterious6500,2025-04-18T10:23:26,5

"Cause Republicans don‚Äôt GIVE. A. FUCK about governing. They only care about power. It‚Äôs truly sad to see how many people don‚Äôt realize modern day Republicans would have been the red coats in 1776. For a people to be so full of patriotism, they would have been killed by the real patriots if they existed back then.",hudi2121,2025-04-18T09:13:39,174

Psychology studies actually prove this bc the main driving force for running for Republicans is winning. More important than actually helping constituents. This is not the case for democrats.,OttoVonBrisson,2025-04-18T11:33:17,36

"Jesus, this üíØ again haha. The majority of the founders were so enlightened that they thought showing compassion to the co-conspirators would lead to a greater union. Fuck no, they should have put them on trial and if convicted, made them second class citizens with limited rights or, sentenced them to the typical treatment for traitors. If you don‚Äôt punish bad behavior, you get a Trump 250 years later. That‚Äôs not to say we haven‚Äôt seen repeats of this via the Civil War, Jim Crow era, etc. When you don‚Äôt punish bad actors, there is no fear from acting bad.",hudi2121,2025-04-18T12:49:36,4
"That's 1 rep per 3500 people, lol. That's more like a high school valedictorian.  I see listings the NH state house is split 222 Republicans / 178 democrats. And the Boston globe in March said that just changed to 201 R / 195 D / 2 I  If accurate, that's a huge swing already.",goldfingers05,2025-04-18T11:25:49,5
