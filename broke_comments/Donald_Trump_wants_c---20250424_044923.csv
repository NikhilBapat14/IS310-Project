"I quit when he gave Milo Y. a platform and affectionately referring to him as ""The Next Chris Hitchens"" before going on to claim sole credit for exposing Milo as sympathetic to pedophiles.

And then blamed Trans people for existing for Trump winning in 2016.  Maher is smug garbage on his best days.",obligatorythr0waway,2025-04-24T08:30:19,4

"Remember that Kid Rock came from privilege and great wealth.  So disappointed in Maher, but he’s been hell bent on shaming woke movement more than chastising MAGA lately.  I find Maher highly intelligent, but he has some weak spots particularly when it comes to COVID vaccines and over generalization of most Muslims.  Also, his wealth and success kind of puts him out of touch with most Americans.",Many_Easy,2025-04-24T11:30:57,1

It’s so clear so many people on Reddit didn’t actually watch the segment,NCSUGrad2012,2025-04-24T07:51:18,-1
He was a left wing talk show host and pundit with liberal beliefs that stuck it to republicans for twenty plus years. His call to fame was having intelligent and provocative red and blue panel talks  to give perspective from both sides while calling republicans on their BS and championing liberal progression.  Nobody was doing what he was for the left on television for well over two decades. It’s the third decade where he changed. The last ten years he has slowly become more of smug prick and a pompous old man. His audience has been dwindling for 5-8 years now because of it.,Last-Evening9033,2025-04-24T12:11:37,12
Thank you!  I thought I was the only one.  Have always been very left and watched his show exactly once and was expecting something…else/better.  It did make me wonder who exactly is the audience.,ClearlyDemented,2025-04-24T09:38:21,8

Ok see I *thought* he was more reasonable a while back but I honestly just thought it was one of those misremembering/rose-color-glasses-ing the past. That explains a lot actually.,littlelupie,2025-04-24T12:35:43,5

The irony is he's a simp for the fanatically religious Israeli government. He has had Netanyahu on his show many times singing his praises. He has promoted ethnic cleansing. He praises any fool (like Fetterman) who supports Israeli war crimes. He made his living on being critical of religion but really he only hated Muslims and Christians. He showed his hand in the interview he did with Christopher Hitchens some years ago when he said that Muslims and Christians are inherently violent and Jews are not. He's a religious extremist rooting for a side.,DetectiveBlackCat,2025-04-24T08:58:04,6
