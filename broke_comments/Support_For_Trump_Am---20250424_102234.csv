"I personally believe that patriotism is not a nationalist view or a love of one's government, but a love for one's neighbors, and I mean any breathing person within the borders of one's country, regardless of their views. I actually feel for people who were too ignorant, too hateful, or too nearsighted to see this coming and are now being affected by it. I derive no joy from watching people suffer, especially entire populations that I share this beautiful country with.    A Latina family member from a previous marriage who suffered from a debilitating mental illness surprised me with her initial support for Donald Trump when he first announced his candidacy. I couldn't understand where the disconnect came from between the words that he spoke and the view that she adopted. I can speculate at causes and explanations, but the fact of the matter is I don't need to understand how it happened to be concerned with her welfare.    To wish for unjust policies to affect anyone, even the people that voted for them, is to relish in the exact sort of suffering that all patriotic Americans should try to prevent at all costs. If we have any mind to transfer our imagined idea of justice from deceiver to the deceived, we are not the patriots that we think we are.",geoffsykes,2025-04-24T11:59:15,1

No but seriously: I think this is unsurprising, given that Spanish-language talk radio has been *heavily* dominated by right-wingers and social media moderation is actually even poorer in non-English social media. Voters who engage with Spanish-language content are actually exposed to even more misinformation and disinformation than voters who engage only with English-language content.   Many people in immigrant communities really believed in the lie that Trump was just going to go after the bad people who weren't respecting the rules, and immigrants who do respect the rules often resent those who they perceive as not respecting the rules‚Äîso that's a persuasive argument to them. However, the Trump admin is treating even the rule-followers very harshly, and making it increasingly difficult to follow the rules‚Äîas many of us knew they would all along.  Also, there are traditionally conservative Latino voting blocs like Cubans, who have powerful anti-communist sentiments that align them with Republicans, and prior Republican presidents have recognized that those communities align with their interests and established or preserved special immigration rules that give preferential treatment to Cubans.

"It's why reactionary populist movements ""work"" while being in a constant state of factional strife. They play to people's ego and perception of status by dividing society into in- and out-groups, proposing a social hierarchy based on identity. This allows everyone to find some reason why they are better and deserve more than whatever group they look down on.  In short, these movements self-select for selfishness, exceptionalism and lack of empathy (or the ability to switch it off towards certain people). This allows the believers to to focus on the perceived faults of those they want to target while ignoring what could make them a target.  But this is a double edged sword, because the degree of exceptionalism that you have to assume to ""feel"" the need for a social hierarchy also implies that you consider yourself special within and central to the movement. A movement that, because this is a beast that needs feeding constantly, will ""other""' more and more of its own members as time goes on. Hence, all of these people will gleefully participate in ostracizing and denouncing their fellow members and then be utterly surprised when it happens to them. And due to the exceptionalism and lack of empathy, there will be no solidarity between them and any other potential victims, so they will be impotent even as they are betrayed.  So the answer to your question is both sad and extremely simple: they expected to stay on the inside of the dividing line, because they thought they were special. They thought they were the heroes of the story, the vanguard, the good people. Just like everyone else in these movements, they feel and believe, but mistake the meaning of what is being said and done, and how it can apply just as easily to them.",barryvm,2025-04-24T11:29:36,11

This is an oversimplification, as it‚Äôs not *just* skin tone that decides what group you belong to, but is a decent starting point for those unfamiliar with the idea entirely.   Many Hispanic Americans wrongly assume that they, at best, can get to the top of the racial hierarchy, or, at worst, they‚Äôll be in the racial ‚Äúmiddle class‚Äù because they‚Äôre ‚Äúthe good ones‚Äù and follow most of the rules regarding racial hierarchy.

"Kingsley is able to ""pass"" as white (a charged concept on its own, as race is a made up concept, and ""white"" has been an amorphous definition throughout the years and regions), which has allowed him (for good and bad reasons) to have a storied career across various kinds of roles. But he was born in India to an Indian parent. Whether he identifies as ""Indian"" is one thing, and whether Indian nationals accept him as someone who belongs as ""Indian"" is another, but the dude is ethnically and (originally) nationally Indian. I haven't read much on his life, but I imagine Kingsley considers himself ethnically mixed (including Indian and English), and is an English citizen, who grew up in England with a largely English identity.",SlaterVBenedict,2025-04-24T17:44:43,1

Your right but I think he actually falls into another demographic. He never watches the news he doesn't know or care how government works so when a few right wingers in his circle tell him Dems are the reason the country is in ruins and it's ILLEGAL immigrants and welfare queens fault he believes them.

I do know however, that if people engage with meaningful criticism to Democrats not living up to the standards of their own party, those same people will be disengaged and the volunteer, activist, and POC portion of the voter base will be likely to stay home or engage in less advocacy for Democrats than would have been gained by simply listening and allowing a single Palestinian to speak at the DNC.

"There's a long list of things that Trump hasn't been allowed to do that he's somehow gotten away with, including fomenting an insurrection. The powers that be may push back against him to a certain degree but he's gonna be able to do plenty of harm without strong enough resistance from the public. As far as US citizens are concerned, he will not be able to deport people who are born within the US, but others who's status could be subject to revocation are going to be fair game. Another option for Trump would be to setup a situation where people have to ""prove"" their citizenship and then allow for the question of the legitimacy of the proof to linger, thereby giving his minions enough time to detain someone. So in that case what is being done is not a legal deportation, but still mirrors much of the things that would happen if it were official. The whole citizenship proof requirement thing that Republicans are harping in is an example of the same type of strategy of placing the burden of proof on the presence of documentation that can later be called into question by the people demanding to see it.",VonThomas353511,2025-04-24T23:07:00,1
