America no longer has a government: It has opera buffa in its place.  We are officially an absurdist farce. And this time the world really is laughing at us.,Beantown-Jack,2025-04-22T11:37:04,8

">Sources say the information Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth shared with his wife and brother on the Signal messaging app came from the CENTCOM General's secure messages. Hegseth says the Signal chats had ""informal"" and ""unclassified"" information in them.   I guarantee everyone in this administration does shit like this daily. The only reason we are privy to what whiskeyleaks is doing is because the administration wants him gone.",ChickpeaDemon,2025-04-22T13:11:06,3
