"[The Trump administration asked Boston for a meeting about antisemitism. Then it went quiet. ](https://archive.is/8OM8q)  >On March 13, the [Trump administration’s antisemitism task force](https://archive.is/o/8OM8q/https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/federal-task-force-combat-antisemitism-visit-leadership-four-big-cities-rocked-incidents) asked Boston Mayor Michelle Wu for a meeting on a serious topic.“We are aware of information alleging that schools in Boston have faced unacceptable incidents of anti-Semitic harassment and violence,” wrote Justice Department attorney Leo Terrell, adding that administration officials wanted to meet with Wu “within the next 30 days.”Officials from the Justice Department proposed a meeting on April 23, and set a [site visit on April 9](https://archive.is/o/8OM8q/https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/04/09/metro/federal-antisemitism-task-force-pre-visit-to-boston/?p1=StaffPage) for staff to prepare for the conversation.But now, a day before the meeting was to take place, the task force appears to have gone quiet, and the proposed gathering seems to be off. City officials say they have not heard from the Justice Department since the April 9 gathering in Boston, and there is no meeting on the schedule for Wednesday.",Condottiero_Magno,2025-04-22T17:23:23,4
