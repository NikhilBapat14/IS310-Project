"And that's the *real* takeaway here. Regardless of what happens with the orange distraction, roughly half of the voting populace of America now supports ending term limits and that should *terrify the fuck out of literally every American with a brain.*",Beneficial_Soup3699,2025-04-24T19:14:34,1

It just cements for me that the American people are too dumb to understand the country that they claim to love  They don't know or care what the Constitution says beyond the couple pieces they need to protect their surrogate penises  The country is already dead. We're just waiting for it to realize it.  This SCOTUS will do something that ends the Union. It might be in the next couple years.,PhoenixTineldyer,2025-04-24T20:32:41,1
"Is it roughly half? Like have you seen actual polling on this? The fact that it has *any* traction should scare the fuck out of people either way, I just haven‚Äôt seen any polling saying half of voters support getting rid of presidential term limits yet, and I assumed that at least a chunk of the Republican Party would still oppose it üò¨",A1sauc3d,2025-04-24T19:17:23,1
