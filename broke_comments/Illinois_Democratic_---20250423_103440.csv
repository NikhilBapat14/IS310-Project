Obama‚Äôs gotta come back.,bassocontinubow,2025-04-23T11:18:37,86
"He has passed his 'best-by shelf life,' not much more he could aspire to.    Sen. Durbin has been a fairly pragmatic Democrat for a couple decades. He is an institutional player, not too far out-of-the-box but no memorable betrayals. I hope his replacement can be as stalwart and reliable.  You want the old to make way for the new? Here's one stepping up - or out.",YallerDawg,2025-04-23T11:32:32,38
A career civil servant and a perennial lock for reelection. Replacing is going to be hard.   The yahoo floodgates are going to open. Gotta watch out for republican sabotage during the primary,Thumbkeeper,2025-04-23T10:52:17,72

This is good. I agree with vice chairman David Hogg. It's well past time we grab the torch from the boomers.,louisianapelican,2025-04-23T14:56:50,6

"I hope the Democratic primary won't be too cutthroat. Rep. Krishnamoorthi has been stockpiling cash (and his House predecessor is Sen. Duckworth) and at least for now, it looks like Pritzker will back Lt. Gov. Stratton for the seat.  May the best Democrat prevail.",MaddAddamOneZ,2025-04-23T19:57:59,2
Good riddance. Maybe his replacement won‚Äôt help Republicans advance their budget bills.,tripping_on_phonics,2025-04-23T12:47:08,4
He was always good to me the times I dealt with him.   Good man.  He was in the same type as Harry Reid.,juni4ling,2025-04-23T19:42:10,1

"Illinois Democrats generally are pragmatic. As a result, the state is probably bluer than at any time since FDR. Democratic growth in Chicago suburbs was recently affirmed by stunning defeats for the GOP in local elections on the same day as the Dem victory in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race.

It‚Äôs favorable in the house but not so much the senate if you look at the various contests. Durban‚Äôs seat should be safe I hope.,Cluefuljewel,2025-04-23T11:25:30,17
