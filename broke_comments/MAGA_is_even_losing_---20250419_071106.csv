"It is democrats vs. republicans. The US is a democracy, so you vote for people affiliated with political parties. Worse than any other kind of rhetoric is the anti-politics kind. No one is above politics or parties. You say, ""Hey, I care about rich vs. poor problems,"" but then I find it difficult to believe. Joe Biden proposed a minimum wage rise, expansion for Medicare, and wealth taxation, and, even with Republican obstruction, was able to pass: biggest infrastructure bill in American history, insulin and other medication caps, caps on credit card rates, sweeping loan forgiveness for students, most pro-union president in US history while Republicans just passed a budget with sweeping cuts to social programs (every single democrat voted against it), implemented tariffs, and want to extend the tax for the rich that they implemented in the last Trump administration. And that was just Joe Biden. Every democratic president makes progress. If not for Obama, people wouldn't even be remotely close to having the level of access to healthcare they have today.  Do you understand what I am saying? There is absolutely no way on earth that a person legitimately preoccupied with wealth inequality could ever make these disparaging statements towards Democrats. They are the only line between you and robber barons. They are no ""lesser evil""; they are people like you who are imperfect. Things are not as simple when you are in the highest levels of public office. People can't just make things happen easily, and it becomes even more difficult when the only people who could be on your side (Democrats) are being relentlessly attacked by you instead of being supported.",RDSF-SD,2025-04-19T08:59:34,10

"I wholeheartedly agree with this. Biden, Obama, Clinton, and even Jimmy Carter were all better than their Republican predecessors. If someone still considers both sides evil after all the actual evil things Republicans have done in the last 9 years, they are not really paying attention.

Leftists who only criticized Kamala and Joe Biden, but never Trump, were usually low information and wedge-issue voters. Their wedge issues were Gaza, and sometimes they don't have a wedge issue. They watch leftist TikToks that make Biden and Kamala look evil or corrupt, and based on these negative emotional associations, they decide not to support them. This is still someone letting their emotions or gut feelings decide not to support either candidate because ""both sides are just as bad.""",x_xHaunter313,2025-04-20T11:01:07,3
"I understand what you are saying. But I still disagree. A huge portion of either side of America HATES the other team. Like it or not they are our neighbors. There’s no longer bipartisanship happening. They are no longer regular people who are imperfect. Do you really think only Republicans benefited off the stock fiasco? I am an independent and I vote Democrat because of the changes you mentioned. The parties need to be replaced and I think a lot of us feel the same way. But like I said it’s a long time coming. Until then vote Democratic and keep your eyes open for the people and politicians who don’t just fall in line. Because it truly is a class situation. Also I disagree that this is anti politics rhetoric. If anything it’s the opposite. I’m pro-politics. I wish every American took politics and the government serious. Instead we fall for propaganda and truly are uneducated on the Constitution and laws. Not all of us, but quite a few. That’s why so many people didn’t vote and why Trump the Horrible won.  Also I’m not trying to knock the movement. Ive participated and have been happy to go out and protest this shit. I just want American citizens to win.",TrainingWill7479,2025-04-19T09:09:25,0

I still stand by saying it’s not about left against right. If everything went to shit and you think most of your democratic representatives would be on the street with you, you’re wrong.

"Too many Democrats sit out elections. At best they show up every four years to vote for president. Republicans have played the long game here for decades.

"I heard that when someone I knew had run for a local office, the Party said they were more focused on the big elections like President and Senate, and they got the bare minimum support. Most of the people in the Democratic Party of Florida were around when Kennedy was president and haven't adapted to the changing political environment.  Here's a story: a friend of mine had a little girl who was in kindergarten. One day, when getting ready for dinner, she stated she didn't want broccoli because broccoli was icky. Her dad looked at her funny because she had always loved broccoli before. He tried to ask her logically what's wrong with broccoli, why is it icky, what brought about this change. When he finally capitulated and said, ""Okay, no more little trees then,"" his daughter spoke up and said, ""But I like little trees!"" She had known broccoli by the nickname ""little trees."" Her disgust was learned from her classmates.  There are two paths ahead - run as an Independent for local elections, foregoing the support of the Democratic Party (unless the Party wants to help left-leaning independents) so their neighbors don't make automatic assumptions and actualy vote on ideas and morals, and then switch parties. Or the Democratic Party better start a massive information campaign as to why you may already approve of Democratic ideas, so why not consider a Democrat?  But I don't see these people changing their votes. They're pissed off. And even if they lose Medicare and Social Security, they won't be THAT pissed off to change parties.  I'd love to be proven wrong.",JRHermle,2025-04-19T13:27:28,3

You may be morally correct, but it will never matter if you never come to power. We need the old farts.",SumpCrab,2025-04-19T15:21:16,1
"Appealing to people's emotions is also a big thing that sways people. Trump absolutely uses this in bad ways, but it can also be done in good ways.   The information campaign on getting people to support Democrats can be done how Bill Clinton and Obama did it, and they did it really well. They understood what people's biggest fears were, and what made them angry at the time: unemployment, the economy, inflation, and the deficit.   They got people to join their cause by appealing to their emotions. Bill Clinton moreso pointed out the Republicans' flaws, and contrasted them with what he would do that was proven to work. He made people **believe** that what he would do would work. Obama did that too.   They also both made their campaigns look like they were the winning sides to their audience. Early on in their campaigns, they called the young people to action. Bill Clinton said that he's on the young people's side, while Bush was not. He told them if they're angry at the old, out of touch Republicans, they need to join his cause.   They also both pointed out poll numbers and did other things to reassure their supporters that they would win. People naturally want to be on the side that's winning, and whoever the candidate is needs to make it look like their cause is winning.   You can sometimes convince a kindergartner to eat broccoli by saying ""you don't like broccoli? Why not? Your mom and I eat broccoli. Your big sister eats broccoli too. Everybody eats it, even all the greatest college basketball and volleyball players."" And then if they start eating their vegetables from then on, reassure them ""see, vegetables are good for you. All the best college basketball players and everyone on the Lakers eats them.""",x_xHaunter313,2025-04-20T17:52:01,1
