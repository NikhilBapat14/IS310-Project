"Honestly?  No specific event/war or anything like that.  But systemic and pugnacious ignorance--the sudden apparent rejection of objective reality and science and reason is by far worse than any war or all wars through human existence--though our insistence on ignorance will help spark a few of those too.  We're speed-running a Voltronpocalypse of pandemics, homelessness, starvation, and yeah, war too.  We're kind of doing exactly all the wrong things for a species to survive very long on this rock--even beyond our killing of our own kind.  We got to this point where we can do almost anything and provide a fantastically rich and healthy long life for everyone living now and more, and yet we're screwing most people out of that as hard as we can.",HardlyDecent,2025-04-19T19:19:48,161
America surrendering its Constitutional right to an incompetent hateful menace.,Utterlybored,2025-04-19T18:31:52,229
"**Losing the ability to solve our problems.**  Climate change, ethnic cleansing in the Middle East, the price of everyday items increasing, etc. there are all *problems* of a specific kind. They’re the kind that *can be solved* if we can organize ourselves the right way. Some of them are harder or more existential than others, but at base, the ability to correct errors faster than they pile up is essential to moving forward rather than backward in quality of life.   We’ve always had problems. Even *new man made* problems. In the 90s we weren’t overreacting when we were worried about Y2K, nor the hole in the ozone layer. Sometimes people forget that those *were real problems* because we were able to solve them. If we hadn’t been, the would be much higher on today’s list of problems, and today’s list would be longer.   But we *did* solve them. We identified what were causing them, changed industrial processes and eliminated the use of CFCs, and painstakingly went through hundreds of millions of lines of code and *fixed our problems*. And eventually the hole closed and the new millennium came without a meltdown.   The same is true of overpopulation fears in the 60s. If you watch old videos of kids growing up in that time period, you can see the common thread. When asked what the problems of the future will be, almost every one of them talks about over-population the way we talk about climate change today or the hole in the ozone layer in the 90s.  And they weren’t wrong. Given what we knew about agriculture at the time we literally were going to run out of food. But at the time, we also had an amazing ability to solve our problems. A bunch of scientists got to work and figured out nitrogen fixing – modern mass fertilization — all without half of our politicians undermining them at every step. In fact, the US funded the research if you can believe it. And this really did radically alter how much food Modern farming could output. And we fixed the problem.     *We are losing that ability in real-time.*  We know what our next most important challenges are and we aren’t fixing them. We’re aware of the problems — particularly Trump. We’re watching an economic freight train barrel down on us and we are frozen in its headlights because we actually don’t have a way to get rid of him. The proper mechanisms have been dismantled. Handled poorly enough, this could be a Great Depression scale problem. And we are handling it poorly. But this won’t be our last problem. They’ll keep pilling up.   **The worst thing that is happening is that we are generally losing the ability to solve our problems**. We’ve cut off so many of our error-correcting mechanisms, defunded the sciences, generally undereducated people and worse lost respect for the process of overturning dogmas when they encounter contravening evidence (learning).   This is the inevitable outcome of building a political party around internal loyalty — at the cost of self-criticism, self-reflection, error-correction. Trump was the natural conclusion. And now his administration is bringing that loyalty first approach every single function of our government.    A cultural respect for rational criticism and institutional practices that make it easy to quickly detect and overturn our mistakes (like who is in power) are essential for our future and the threats we have yet to encounter. Losing that ability is historically what led to the rapid downfall of once mighty societies.",fox-mcleod,2025-04-19T18:45:29,98

In America it’s a president on the verge of ignoring the judicial branch and even the Supreme Court.  Trump is 3 months in and trying to avoid following court orders.  That’s a major concern.  He is also choosing to wreck the economy and alliances with his trade war but that won’t destroy America as much as if we allow a president to ignore the constitution.,secrerofficeninja,2025-04-19T19:25:23,7

We're losing our ability to collaborate and fix problems. Everything is so globalized now,.. that even small things (as we saw with covid19) in far away places can just get on a cruise ship or airplane and be in NYC in a few hours. We have to do better fixing and supporting some of the worst areas of the globe,.. because that's where difficult problems evolve from.

Coming from numerous angles including the attacking and methodical destruction of our science industry and defunding of reaearch at our top universities.  We have had the best schools in the world and the amount of research our government funded was so powerful from a diplomatic perspective as well as an industrial perspective.  We were at the forefront of so many technological advancements.  And now we have a mass exodus of the top minds looking for stability and even just basic funding that was cut by our gov.  Other countries are all offering them money to continue their research there. Especially China.    Some of the effects of this will be less noticeable,  because we won't know that we would have made breakthroughs in some technologies that change the world but we won't get them from us now it seems.

"Lots to unpack here, so I'm going to take your points one at a time.  >You do not like Trump. That is fine.   That's putting it lightly. I have a big problem with having someone that is a convicted felon and a rapist in charge of the most powerful nation on earth. A man that lies every time he opens his mouth. Just yesterday he said that eggs were the cheapest they've been in years and gas was under 2 dollars. Both very easy to prove wrong. But he said it anyway. That's just an example of the gaslighting this man has tried in the last 2 months and all 4 years of his first term. 538,215 people died from Covid due to Trump not taking action for 3 months! That's a lot of blood on his hands. Some of the insane things he said to do would have resulted in many more deaths.   >Decreasing the size of our government is necessary.  I agree. But the method by which he is doing it currently (using Musk and DOGE) is incredibly stupid and dangerous. It's ripping out major parts of an intricate machine before they have even been educated about what each part does. There is a much better and slower way to do this, but that's not their objective.   > Increasing Tariffs will move businesses back to America  This is so incredibly false and has zero basis in reality. First of all, the type of factories that are needed to create the goods that we currently get from China, India, Japan, etc. take YEARS to build, starting around 4 years and usually around 6. Why? Because the permits needed to build them take at least a year to get approved. Then the type of manufacturing equipment needed takes a long time to order, get in place, test, etc. That's not even the biggest problem. The biggest problem is finding a company that's willing to build a factory here because there is a giant lack of potential employees that are *trained* to do the type of work needed at the pay that they currently enjoy making a profit from in other countries. Simply put, it's not going to happen.   Increasing tariffs is Trump and his crony's way of offsetting the huge tax cut they're giving themselves. They wrongly think that increasing tariffs (which is nothing more than a tax on goods you and I are buying) will somehow offset the millions that SHOULD be paid by the oligarchs that own the huge businesses that moved everything to China in the first place! So who pays that cost? You and I do. The tariffs are a tax on Americans buying goods from these countries, it's built into the higher price. Those countries don't pay a tariff. They simply increase the price of what they sell. The BUYER pays the tariff to our govt. and then passes that higher price on to you.   >The number of jobs will increase in manufacturing.  Again, false and zero basis in reality. If anything, in a new factory, the new jobs will be held by robots. Nobody is going to build a factory in 2025 that isn't almost fully automated. So even if we were to believe that new factory building is going to happen (see point 1) it would not be a scenario where there would be a lot of jobs available, certainly not enough to tip the scales in any way.  >Stop sending our business to China.  China makes almost 80 percent of the circuit boards that run our cell phones, computers, home appliances, cars and more. (The rest are made in Japan, India and S. Korea) American business owners set that system up in the first place. We weren't forced to do business with them. Greed caused American business tycoons to move to China in order to get bigger profits for themselves. They are the ones that decided to invest in China instead of America. Trump has all of his merchandise (flags, hats, signs, etc.) made in China. You cannot buy most hard goods from America because we don't make most of them here. That includes electronics, furniture, appliances and more. If we tried to make them here, they would cost a fortune because workers need a living wage in the U.S. to survive. We'd have to pay them at least 17 dollars an hour which would mean the products would be triple the price they are now.   >Our constitution is old it is older than constitutions of other countries. It is barely useful. It is constantly amended and distorted to meet the needs of the few.  Actually we're no. 3. I invite you to [look at this map.](https://www.statista.com/chart/16355/constitutions-world-oldest/)  You say it is barely useful which I consider not only shameful but incredibly ignorant and apparently you have not read the constitution. Every time the government tries to strip a certain segment of the population of it's rights, the Supreme Court points to the constitution and says ""Nope, you can't do it. This is why."" So, your right to have a gun, to vote, to speak out without fear of being arrested (at least for now), your right to assemble for a strike, (and lots more) is all promised in the constitution. It's our system of government. It's the document which tells us about the president, the congress, voting, everything! And it's not just distorted for the few. It's amended for ALL of us.   >40% of my check goes to taxes  Congratulations, that means you are making over 200k a year. Because if you [check out this chart](https://taxfoundation.org/data/all/federal/2024-tax-brackets/), the tax rate for people making up to 200k is 24%. So either you are pulling that figure out of thin air, or you are getting ripped off by whoever does your taxes.   >Our bloated government has not done anything for me.  Highways, parks, libraries, the military, access to hospitals, and a whole host of [social programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_programs_in_the_United_States) are the benefit of living in the U.S. under our current government. Until just recently, these were run in a pretty efficient manner, most audits show that there was only a 9 - 11 percent waste factor in only a few of these programs. If you have not checked into them, perhaps you should while they still exist. The government has also provided a relatively safe country (comparatively speaking) for you to live in where you don't have to worry about a neighboring country invading. Unless you are living in a shack and are starving on a weekly basis, I don't think you are looking at this from the right perspective. I'm not rich either, but I have a roof over my head and food to eat. Look at how many in the world don't have those two basic things.   It sounds to me like you got a bum deal in many ways, but if you have not tried to get assistance from your state, local and federal programs, that's on you. It's out there and it's not that hard to get. Free legal assistance in many areas, food banks, etc.  But it also sounds like you perhaps want to blame the government for a lot of things that went wrong for you and then say ""burn it all down and remake it"" because of that. Is it perfect? No. But if you look at other countries, it is far superior in many ways.",thewoodsiswatching,2025-04-19T22:00:26,26

Having access to cheap labor overseas has significantly increased YOUR standard of living.  And you have no idea what’s barreling straight down the road at us.
