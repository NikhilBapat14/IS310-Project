">President Donald Trump has ordered sharper scrutiny of America’s colleges and the accreditors that oversee them, part of his escalating campaign to end what he calls "" wokeness ” and diversity efforts in education.  >In a series of executive actions signed Wednesday, Trump targeted universities that he views as liberal adversaries to his political agenda. One order called for harder enforcement of a federal law requiring colleges to disclose their financial ties with foreign sources, while another called for a shakeup of the accrediting bodies that decide whether colleges can accept federal financial aid awarded to students.  >Trump also ordered the Education Department to root out efforts to ensure equity in discipline in the nation’s K-12 schools. Previous guidance from Democratic administrations directed schools not to disproportionately punish underrepresented minorities such as Black and Native American students. The administration says equity efforts amount to racial discrimination.",fungobat,2025-04-23T19:52:36,5

Fairness is subjective. To one person the equalizing affect of an equity program is great. To another person it's a hurdle. It's all subjective.   Good government is to help everybody based on need.,pickledplumber,2025-04-23T19:59:16,-29

Tuition will go up for those who survive.  I think the secondary vision is to ensure college is infeasible for non-trust fund kids. It already almost is.    The MAGA base already parrots “college brainwashing”.   Serves their masters plus it’s validating.,First-Ad-2777,2025-04-23T21:06:07,6

That's exactly what they've been saying for acting DEI. They don't care about equity nor do they understand it. It's such a backwards manipulation tactic to help people be more racist without feeling the guilt and shame. Though I guess Trump and his supporters may not feel much shame.,abida_abida,2025-04-23T22:07:14,7

I didn't say it was every effort. But could a program not exist where it is the case?,pickledplumber,2025-04-23T20:39:14,0
What makes it ridiculous?  There are programs that in the name of equity becomes hurdles for others. An example would be changing the admission criteria for specialized high schools to favor certain demographics. Yes it helps those special demographics but at the same time to the students who aren't favored then it's a hurdle.   I write more about it here https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/s/kSbLpMxlF5,pickledplumber,2025-04-23T20:29:18,-16

Sure and sometimes as I said there then exists a hurdle for some people. You may agree or disagree with it. Doesn't mean it's not the case.,pickledplumber,2025-04-23T21:07:44,-3

How is that possible? Look.at this example I talk about here   https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/s/kSbLpMxlF5  It's well talked about in the news. Another is favoring certain races for COVID treatment in NYC.,pickledplumber,2025-04-23T21:19:06,-2
"Thanks for the link to someone tearing down your argument.  As far as your NYC example goes, as someone who lived there at the time there was a significant, measurable risk difference between whites and non-whites. It wasn't clear what the reasons were: living conditions, job exposures, medical availability, etc. But it was real enough that this pasty white guy was actually personally relieved by the news.  So, yeah, triaging aid for those who need it most is the most reasonable approach to crisis management.",Grandpa_No,2025-04-23T22:05:35,3

So the need of the whole overrides the needs of the individual? So men are so much more likely to commit suicide. Should we restrict mental health from women in general just because men overall do worse? What about potential individual women who are much worse off.   I think this has to be trolling.   https://nyulangone.org/news/once-hospitalized-black-patients-covid-19-have-lower-risk-death-white-patients,pickledplumber,2025-04-23T22:13:55,-1
"Check the date on that sparky. We were almost a full year in and, yes, the negative outcomes began to skew Hispanic. Queens and the Bronx were hit hard.  Again, I was there and walked past the morgue trucks daily. You can take your racism elsewhere.",Grandpa_No,2025-04-24T10:19:48,1
"> So the need of the whole overrides the needs of the individual?   Triaging means applying resources to where they're needed most/likely to have the most benefit. So, yes. It's a way to maximize outcomes for the whole.",Grandpa_No,2025-04-24T10:16:39,1
"I'm not sure what you mean. Yes a year in and the equity policy I'm talking about came in early 2022.   So the findings were well established that Black folks, once getting care fared better than some Whites. So the remedy was access not necessarily treatment.   You're also not considering vaccination rates and adherence. You don't give a drink a liver transplant.   You keep calling me racist but you're the only one here promoting discrimination.",pickledplumber,2025-04-24T10:38:32,1
"But they didn't apply them where they were most needed. The link I posted showed that Black folks did better than Whites once in the hospital. This was before the special treatments were even used in mass.   It means for Black folks the issue was access or perception of access to healthcare. Not treatment limitations.   Recipe needs a bigger pot, tosses in salt instead.",pickledplumber,2025-04-24T10:30:10,1
