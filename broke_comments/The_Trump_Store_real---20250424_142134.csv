"I see people attempting to defend Trump stating that they believe he is joking. As a politician and the current sitting president he is very well protected by the first amendment.  He could very well could be joking, and yet at the same time how many of those who are defending him have asked the question of ‚ÄúWhat if he **not** joking?‚Äù Additionally if he is not joking what does this mean for the constitution?  If we are assuming someone‚Äôs intentions without them explicitly telling us so(aka a cognitive distortion called mind reading), then we must also be open to the idea that we may be wrong in our assumption as well. That is a simple fact. To me this is a deliberate action taken by Trump that has multiple different interpretations as to why he took it. Some of those interpretations can be considered extremely concerning in regards to the constitution.",CutieTheTurtle,2025-04-24T18:43:55,375

How about no? He‚Äôs getting his eight years and that‚Äôs all he deserves. Trump often likes to compare himself to people like George Washington but George Washington was intelligent and humble enough to realize that having more than 8 years is too much for one person.,Stea1thsniper32,2025-04-24T15:36:36,1333

Trump is his own worst enemy. If he could just resist that seemingly irresistible temptation to put his god damn foot in his mouth for just once.  He's not getting half of democrats to support him becoming president for 12 years. So what the fuck is the purpose here?

The SC won't take the last line of the 12th (dealing with constitutional eligibility) and apply it to the 22nd (which clearly and unambiguous states that no one shall be ELECTED twice). If the 22nd was meant to keep someone from SERVING three terms it would have said that. The fact that he could be appointed as Speaker of the House and have the new Pres and VP resign and then serve a 3rd term undercuts your argument completely.,cakebreaker2,2025-04-24T18:04:06,-211

"Thats a good point. I think it‚Äôs still legally debatable though. Technically, Trump is eligible to serve, just not to be elected as president.
