This shouldn’t be called a deportation. It really isn’t. It’s a false imprisonment. He’s not just in his country and free.,Fun_East8985,2025-04-22T07:13:22,50

"Possibly, if presented correctly. But, there is no chance whatsoever that you will be able to sway a single fox news viewer. None. Zero. They have already made up their minds that he is worse than Al Queda.",rjsatkow,2025-04-22T06:49:05,40
"Meh.    It’s one issue among many.  Trump has given the Democrats a smorgasbord of issues to choose from.  It would be most unwise - and completely stupid - to focus on one issue to stake an election on.    Hit the GOP on all points.  Cause chaos in their messaging, like they do with us.  Stop playing by the rules, stop pretending these are normal times.",Neko_Dash,2025-04-22T07:33:09,9
We gotta study the Viktor orban playbook and beat em at their own game. Seriously trump loves orbans playbook,RobNY54,2025-04-22T08:23:30,6
"As long as it is not about the man but about the process.  Everyone has a right to due process.  If on determination they will rescind his deportation waiver, he then should leave USA but he should not be sent to a foreign prison unless El Salvador asks for extradition treaty for crimes committed in El salvador with arrest warrant.",Any_Brick1860,2025-04-22T10:28:19,6
I don't care if it's a winning issue or if it's a horrible issue. We have somebody who's been wronged in the right thing to do is to fix it.,MidnightNo1766,2025-04-22T08:48:50,5
Okay? And what are they gonna do about all the others wrongly deported and placed in that prison? I have no idea why we are focusing so much on this one guy when there are others just like him. There’s a Venezuelan asylum seeker that was arrested in DFW and sent to CECOT in El Salvador because of his Autism awareness tattoo. That one seems like a bigger case considering he’s not even from El Salvador yet they sent him there anyways.,Tiiimmmaayy,2025-04-22T10:20:11,3

"For myself, I want to hear how the DNC is going to eliminate corporate and super pac political donations. Along with stock trading.   If I don’t hear that, it all sounds like keeping the status quo BS.",Medium_Green6700,2025-04-22T08:27:19,2
Democrats will rally around anything but turning their backs on the corporate overlords and helping workers.,MF_Ryan,2025-04-22T08:52:35,2
Dems need to stop looking for quick wins or “a winning issue”. We need broad solutions that will inspire trust and confidence that we should be in power,No_Hope_75,2025-04-22T11:06:04,2
"Yeah, i think its a message that resonates with a segment of the public for sure, but I dont think this is a winning issue any more than saving abortion rights or democracy was a few months ago.",chaos0xomega,2025-04-22T06:52:41,2

"I agree it's a winning issue. But, we need to keep our eye on the ball and not fall into the Republican trap of this becoming about one man.   This is about due process and the protections granted to anyone inside US borders.   Eye on the ball.",ScotchCigarsEspresso,2025-04-22T15:09:18,1
"It’s rendition not deportation. Deportation involves the legal  movement of people who have violated immigration laws while rendition is extrajudicial, secretive, and unlawful.",Hope4years,2025-04-22T21:33:21,1

Exactly. It might be a winning issue but I don’t see this party or this media environment covering it in a way that democrats can win on.,davidw223,2025-04-22T09:02:28,5
Our banana republic. We have to live in this crazy shithole even if we didn’t vote for it.,davidw223,2025-04-22T09:03:12,6
Ignoring this is going to fuck with us again. They are prepared and practiced at propaganda.,Ok-Stress-3570,2025-04-22T07:00:24,16
Yep. It’s another rhorschach test where people will see what they believe reflected in the issue. It’s probably not the best case to campaign on since conservatives will see them protesting the deportation of an immigrant back to their home country and wonder what the big deal is and think democrats are more out of touch than usual.,davidw223,2025-04-22T09:01:46,7
Yes that is why it should not be about 1 man but about the process.,Any_Brick1860,2025-04-22T10:29:19,6

It’s a little misleading to keep calling it a deportation; especially when the media does it. A normal deportation results in being let out in your home country. This is not that.,Fun_East8985,2025-04-22T08:14:01,12
