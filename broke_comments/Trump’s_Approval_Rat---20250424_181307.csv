"Who knew that after all of DJT's promises of a bright future under his leadership that he would piss off allies, deport people without due process, attempt to strip human rights, lie about egg and gasoline prices and start an unwinnable trade war that people would start to have negative views of him and his ill conceived policies.",Troll_in_the_Knoll,2025-04-24T18:35:50,1
You know how much of a moron Trump gotta be for  Bush’s approval rating to be higher than his lol,MeatPrestigious3597,2025-04-24T20:28:21,1

Americans do not agree with this traitor. He’s a wannabe dictator and America is not the country for that.,SirMasterDrew,2025-04-24T22:45:37,1
I can believe it. All my moderate or center-right friends aren’t fans at the moment.   Only true MAGA really support him right now. Most of the grievances stem from childish behavior and bullying on the world stage by use of tariffs.,AgileFlea77,2025-04-24T18:40:55,1

"Before 2015, he was just some reality TV show guy, and some random cameo from Home Alone. He was generic business guy the billionaire, and outside other billionaires almost no one really knew him.
