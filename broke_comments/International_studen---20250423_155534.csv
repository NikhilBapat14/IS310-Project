"the administration has done a fantastic job of sabotaging the country at all levels, we see talented, intelligent individuals who want to bring their expertise and drive to our workforce and collective knowledge base and kick them out  I'm so motivated to fight for an idealized America before we're crushed forever, and leave behind the mouth-breathers that want to see us fail out of spite or incomprehension.",Gekokapowco,2025-04-23T16:36:01,5
"I'm kind of confused about this article.  The article states that the person in question was in the US as a student, then graduated, got a job and a work permit.  Then it says: ""Then, an email changed everything. Screenshots from a federal database showed his ""sevis record"" — the digital proof of a valid student visa — as ""terminated.""  Since the student graduated, wouldn't it be normal for their student visa to be expired since they are not enrolled in a school anymore? Are they not on a work visa now that they have their work permit?",PersonaLaenir,2025-04-23T16:54:09,1

It says they got a new job and a work permit.,anfornum,2025-04-23T18:11:44,3
Student visa always includes 12 months of post-graduation “OPT” (optional practical training).  That usually allows you to work while your employer applies for an h1b visa.  They cancelled their OPT.,staviscak,2025-04-23T20:05:19,3
Why do you feel it necessary to call this person an idiot from a simple off the cuff type comment?   Does it make you feel good?,TheAdelaidian,2025-04-24T02:58:30,1
Thanks for the clarification! I was incorrectly assuming that work permit and work visa were synonymous.,PersonaLaenir,2025-04-23T20:16:56,1

That makes no sense. How was even an idiot to begin with for simply stating something when asked a question,TheAdelaidian,2025-04-24T06:34:55,1
