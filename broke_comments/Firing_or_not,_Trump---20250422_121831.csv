"Let’s play this out. Trump says the economy isn’t doing as well as it should because Powell won’t drop interest rates. Trump fires Powell, and appoints someone else who WILL drop interest rates. The inflation from tariffs will continue to get worse, but without higher interest rates to control inflation, inflation will skyrocket. Tariffs are also causing confidence in America in general, and in the bond market (that funds our national debt on an ongoing basis). When that confidence drops, the interest rate on those bonds must go up to maintain interest (higher return rates needed to offset higher risk)…but…this new fed chair just dropped interest rates. So nobody wants to buy our bonds….it’ll be like someone living on a credit card, and that credit card gets shut off. Federal money will stop flowing. The resulting crash of our economy will be catastrophic. I seriously doubt Powell will be blamed for this.",Austin_Peep_9396,2025-04-22T13:05:35,4

"I pray that this isn't going to work as well as you'd think or even better, that it has a good chance to backfire, especially since Trump appointed him in the first place. When you try to direct Americans' economic woes and anger towards one person, even when you replace him, people will remain primed to blame one person. And even if Trump appoints someone new, it's not like he can start by immediately blaming him, so the anger will likely be directed towards the true source of the problems: Trump himself.    Then again, there are a lot of people who carry water for Trump, and a lot of supporters who will not ever change their minds. So nothing really makes sense anymore. ",throwleavemealone,2025-04-22T12:29:11,2

"***From Business Insider's Jennifer Sor***:  For all his back-and-forth on tariffs, President Donald Trump has been crystal clear on one issue in recent weeks: the performance of Fed chief Jerome Powell. Based on the president's assessment, it's not good.  Trump has been vocal about his desire to fire the head of the central bank before his term is up in 2026, a move that Powell himself has said would be illegal.  But regardless of whether he [fires Powell](https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-today-selloff-sell-america-trump-fed-independence-bonds-2025-4), Trump could have a larger goal in mind when he blasts the Fed chair as a ""major loser,"" as he did in a Truth Social post Monday. The president's aim, said some market observers, may be to redirect blame to the central bank, not his own unpredictable trade policy, in the event of an economic downturn.  ""Trump obviously is worrying that the economy weakens, then Americans will blame him for it. But now, his explanation will be that 'it wasn't me that caused this recession, it was the Fed by not accommodating my tariffs,'"" Edward Yardeni, the president of Yardeni Research, told Business Insider in an interview. In a note last week, Yardeni said Trump was setting Powell up as the ""fall guy"" if the economy stumbles.  That message has sharpened in recent weeks, with [Trump haranguing the Fed](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-jerome-powell-feud-rivalry-interest-rates-stocks-economy-2025-4) to cut rates immediately or be prepared to take the heat if the economy takes a turn for the worse.

The US bond markets where the GOP prefers to go for funding (vs the Democrats who prefer taxing wealthy Republicans for their funding).
