"My parents just visited China. They have the world’s 3 fastest bullet trains. Technologically they are cutting edge. Their cities are clean and orderly despite insanely populated. Their authoritarian government is determined to make them a super power and they largely benefit from a compliant society while lacking the whipsaw political effect that we get every 4-8 years in the US which kills all forward progress. They are focused on the next several decades while the US is focused on election cycles. So yeah, they’re coming up.",fapnaysh,2025-04-08T07:04:17,74

All are both negotiating with the States, whilst seeking (successfully) alternate avenues for trade and Defence.  'Will China become the world dominant superpower and surpass the United States'  Sort of. They’ll surpass the US in military, economic and technological powers.

"The problem for China has always been two-fold: hard and soft power.  Their military might is roughly on par with America's these days, though that's hard to say for certain without directly testing it. Still, they *claim* capabilities that would make them equals.  Soft power is where the US has led since roughly the end of WW2, when the regime changed and isolationism became unthinkable. The cold war taught the US a brutal lesson in the importance and usage of soft power.  Because of that, the US helped build a new economic order, one where everyone was intertwined and co-depedent. This order was the so called 'world government' that conspiracy theorists were on about for so long.  Being one of the prime architects of this new order meant the US built an *incredible* amount of soft power. They could go anywhere and ask for pretty much whatever it wanted.  The US used this leverage to turn itself into *the* economic powerhouse of the world. No one else could compete. Everyone else was dependent. To the point that other countries still trade in US currency - the petro-dollar.  The US lead wasn't just great, it was insurmountable. No one country could overthrow US dominance on its own.  Now, however, they don't have to. Trump's tariffs are causing them to band together and retool their economies so they aren't dependent solely on the US anymore. The process has already started. It's going to take years, if not decades, for it to happen, but the result is that eventually the US will not have more than a fraction of the soft power it once had.  China will gladly contest for the spot. Their middle class has been exploding, they've been investing heavily in their scientific base, and they are quick to (over)invest in new potential opportunities.  They are positioned to take advantage.  I don't know if China will become the 'economic superpower' that the US has been. I kind of doubt it. My read is that countries that are capable of it will ensure they are never as uniquely dependent on a single country for their economic health ever again. They will diversify their trade deals.  In all likelihood, we will see the end of the age of superpowers. Does that leave China stronger than the US? I have no idea. But it leaves the US immeasurably weaker and thus vulnerable to being overtaken.",cromethus,2025-04-08T07:55:04,11
"For most of history, the world hasn't had a dominant superpower. In between the fall of Rome and the rise of Britain, it was a violent, unstable, mostly very poor place. China is great at building stuff but falls short in most other aspects of superpower-dom. The EU is barely a great power even within Europe. Most likely for the next forty years there will simply not be a world order like there has been for the last forty.",The_Awful-Truth,2025-04-08T08:50:16,4
"No. It would required extended periods of more Trump sabotage for America to hand it to China.  The gap between the 2 is still massive.  The US foundation and advantages are still there.  It's like a historical Chinese dynasty where a run of good emperors led to golden ages.  Those were rare and there'd be average or bad emperors in between.  An extended period of bad emperors could lead to irreversible decline if there were also other crises that were mismanaged.  America can turf them out every 4 years.   I'd say every 2 years can lead to power changes but congress isn't doing much atm to check him.  America will still be dominant but it will be a multipolar world.    China has caught up or close to in some areas but in others she is still a fair bit behind.  China has their own self sabotaging leader in Xi.  There is intrigue going on as the 2 factions were supposed to alternate in power but Xi suppressed them, got rid of term limits and stayed on.    China's housing market has crashed but it is illegal to reduce prices more than the official limits.  People are stuck with properties they can't pay for and there is no declaring bankruptcy to free yourself.  That will follow you and their social credit system will force sanctions on you for not paying.  People are literally giving away homes to free themselves from the obligation.  Their population is aging and in decline.  They don't do immigration.  So demand might never pick up.  To even recover they need to let the market actually crash but they spent their way out of the last crashes so they've saved up a ton of pain.  Withdrawal of lots of foreign investment and countries has cause a ton of job losses.  Now tariffs from many countries has curbed her exports.  China relies on exports as her people have little disposable income.  Their wages have been kept down but housing also takes up a huge portion of income.    China doesn't have the same cultural power.  Her projection of military power is limited as she doesn't have friendly ports.",captain-burrito,2025-04-08T11:50:07,5

"I don't think the US military advantage will be eclipsed by China even within a decade, they are too far behind for that even with Trump's chaos and stupidity.  Economically, China faces long term aging demographic issues and trouble developing a robust consumer class but they were already going to catch up in terms of production and the recent administration moves do leave a vacuum for a large, reliable trade partner that China can definitely fill.

"It is too difficult to know given what has been said of the ageing Chinese population, troubles in their economy and so on. I think China will continue to grow impressively and will retain a lead in electric vehicles, robotics and possibly smart phones. Militarily they will be as unassailable as the US. In space US appears to have dominance for the forseeable.   I think the era of the obvious US hegemony is passing. I think there will be a lot of interesting reshuffles of allegiances between nations in the decades to come. There will be shifting coalitions for example Russia with China. India may side with China in due course and become more formidable in its own right. Truly I think we are simply entering a more level future. Multi polar as the Russian propagandists like to say.   And this will possibly be a good thing if we can ever bring about a standard of the strong leaving the weak alone. I think ultimately if we can reach a world where every nation can maintain something approaching the standard of living in the US that would be an amazing world.",theoscarsclub,2025-04-08T07:08:40,3
"The population conversation seems to ignore India. It's kind of weird. The population of India has surpassed that of China. India had 1.84 billion in 2024 compared to China's 1.425. Yet, no one talks about India being a superpower. It's not about population. It's about where the leadership is taking the people. China is reaching out to developing nations seeking trade deals in exchange for resources. Of course, there are strings attached, the same as deals with the US. The Chinese have a considered approach. We have a reactive approach. Had we made more effort to secularise and educate our people instead of allowing so much misinformation to fester we would have better standing in the world. So it appears that China's star is rising.",Epona44,2025-04-08T07:20:17,3

"They have a bunch of problems plaguing them. They have their own cult of personality issue with Xi, and he has his own ideologies too (disdain for stimulus, what the proper balance of manufacturing is, so on...). Their population isn't a big problem if they're hitting their stride in the next decade, because they can just allow immigrants (though this might be cultural anathema). They are still behind us in several key technologies. Semiconductors is one of them, though mostly because it was a big investment push by the U.S. and the EU and it's not gonna be easy for them to get a replacement.  That doesn't mean they *can't* become the dominant superpower. It just means it's not certain. After the fall of the USSR, it was very clear the U.S. was going to be the dominant superpower. Right now, this might be a suez canal event for the U.S., or it might not be.  A few things could go terribly wrong. For example, maybe Canon gets their EUV alternative to work, and they just start selling to China. Meanwhile, U.S. has an extended period of stagflation from current policies and another middle eastern conflict involving Iran and Israel. If that war starts after significant Chinese electrification (like in 2-3 years if they hit like 40-50%) they might be able to get by with Russian Oil. Such a combination could drastically change the landscape of investment, and they could potentially get one of the first next key technologies, like Fusion, AI, Biotech/biomanufacturing, Space dominance. They're behind us now on all of these, but if we're defunding our R&D, getting into a tussle with everyone, and pushing the rest of Asia and China together, it could be bad.  My belief has always been that they only need one stand out tech lead to get past the middle income trap. I think that will be EVs. In the next decade, they might crack semiconductors. Hell, maybe they get the first fusion energy, or they figure out propulsion and surpass us. It's hard to predict 20 years out. And if opportunity is in China, immigrants will go. Brains go where brains get paid, can live a good life, and be respected.",vhu9644,2025-04-08T06:22:43,5

"The US economy is large but highly volatile due to the stock market, taxes, price gouging, and interest rate fluctuations. Elon Musk and every other millionaire and billionaire in America pays no income tax and if they did, social security, Medicaid, Medicare, Veterans Affairs, SNAP benefits, public education, and other social welfare programs could be expanded. If all the millionaires paid their taxes for every year they paid nothing, the national debt would be at least $12 trillion less than it is now.  China doesn't care about the stock market. They focus on purchasing power parity, which measures the value of goods and services domestically, and using this metric they surpassed the United States in 2017. They might have lower income classes but they have much stronger industry and way lower domestic costs. And, unlike the United States, they have not been engaged in a war since 1979.  The United States market is extremely volatile because they combine military and economic strategies to exert global dominance. They go around Congress and use military interventions to control resources and they overthrow or assassinate anyone not favorable to their own interests as seen in Iran in 1953 and more recently with Saddam Hussein and Gaddafi. Gaddafi partnered with Africa to make a new currency backed by gold which would have destroyed the American debt based currency. Countries would have been able to buy oil in the gold dinar instead of the petrodollar system and the United States Fiat currency would lose all purchasing power.   I don't really know how to answer your question ethically because I don't agree with dominant superpowers that draw the entire world into military conflicts that lead to organizations like Al Qaeda and ISIS and neverending military interventions, regime changes and global instability. The loss of life is unfathomable since WWII.

"No, I don't think so. We see for a while now that China grows exceedingly politically and economically unstable, completely independent of Americans current situation. The cheap manufacturing in China by harming population and natural resources are not sustainable, especially with ongoing digitalization and robotisation (like 3d printing) allowing cheap production outside if China. Not to mention that many essential production limes are pulled out since the covid chaos.

"China can't really become a superpower in the sense that the US did or that the Soviets did because of their ideology. The Soviets could point towards a shared ideal of world communism. The US could point to the Soviet shared ideal of world communism and say ""bugger that, everyone who's against that with me!"" (The attractiveness of a shared capitalist system aside, at least the US could say ""we're fine if you get rich too""...)  China doesn't have that kind of ideology to point towards. Their policy is ""China first"" in a way that makes anything Trump is doing look like a pouting kid. They've managed to alienate all of their neighbors through territorial claims, wars, and decades of hostile rhetoric. They have -no- potential allies, not even the Russians (with which they are happy to casually toss around the same kind of ""well, maybe we'll grab some of your territory"" rhetoric that has everyone so outraged over Greenland.) Nobody is likely to invite China to participate in a defense treaty.  That doesn't mean that China can't buy influence - it's convenient to have a bunch of banks who will make loans when you order them without being worried about getting repaid, especially when in return you let the bank cook the books to hide the shortfall. But those things are unlikely to materially increase Chinese power, excepting their chances of striking favorable deals for the importation of raw resources.",Avatar_exADV,2025-04-08T12:31:52,4

"No. China has a looming population crisis, and is also eventually going to fall victim to the plague of all authoritarian regimes - unresponsiveness. There is no mechanism for legitimate criticism in authoritarian regimes, and usually tight control of information leads the leader to make an absurdly poor decision as some point (ex: Mao killing the sparrow, Russian invasion of Ukraine).  For all of USA’s problems, our political and economic systems are relatively flexible, which leaves room for the USA to potentially experience a resurgence. Lawmakers are incentivized to do *something* about the most immediate problems due to their fear of losing re-election. For example, if the Congress allows social security to go insolvent, lots of members can expect to be ousted (whether by primary in a safe seat, or the other party in swing seats). American politicians, as out of touch as they seem, are ultimately accountable to voters (even if these are mostly just the party base) and cannot risk alienating them forever.",deathbytray101,2025-04-08T17:36:48,2

"First, the US record deficit would be crippling if the world did not see the dollar as a reserve currency.

The world buys those bonds based on the belief the US is capable and willing to pay the interest on our debt.  That belief has to be close to shattering due to the way Trump is treating the entire planet in his tariff war.  If he can disrupt world trade based on childish beliefs, what's to stop him from simply saying he won't pay America's incurred debts?  He has a history of refusing to pay in his private ventures as a billionaire real estate mogul.  I don't know if the free world leaders (EU, Japan, South Korea, Canada, Mexico, India to name a few) would necessarily cozy up to China though.  China may well attack Taiwan in the near future which will disrupt world markets.  That takeover may well flip the advanced chip market (think AI), smart weaponry, etc.) as one Taiwan company makes the majority of the world's most advanced chips.

The Kremlins only leverage is their natural resources extracted by their ethnic minorities, which is why the war never escalated into nuclear conflict…basically Europeans don’t mind slave labor for their energy consumption! So the war is kept in the trenches and air combat has been tempered, which would escalate into nuclear options. The average Chinese man will never dig in trenches and fight if the CCP were to invade. The CCP air might is not battle tested, so it’s basically a guessing game, and Europe/U.S. have clear advantages over the air and sea.

"Just because China has shiny infrastructure doesn’t mean it’s in a strong long-term position. Much of that development—especially in real estate and local government projects—is heavily debt-financed, often through opaque off-balance-sheet vehicles. The scale of misallocated capital dwarfs even U.S. public debt concerns.  China’s demographic collapse—a direct result of the One-Child Policy—is also a ticking time bomb. A shrinking, aging population with fewer workers and more retirees will crush its already fragile social safety net and suppress long-term growth.  Yes, authoritarian systems can move quickly, but that opens up the door to mismanagement. And that has happened in many respects, even if not apparent visiting there.  China is often even referred to as a “paper tiger.” It looks powerful on the outside, but internally it’s facing structural debt, demographic decay, capital flight, and rising domestic unrest.

Replacing the ingredients and then broken up further to pay for everything required to get that food to me.   Broken further down.  1. Employee pay. Tax.   1. Ingredients need to get to the store. That requires transportation. A person paid to drive the truck, tax. A for profit transportation company, tax. Buying the semi truck, tax. Paying a mechanic to maintain the truck, tax. Which is yet another for profit company, tax. Registration on the vehicle, tax.  The tools the shop/mechanic needs, tax. Fuel, tax. Those ingredients need to be prepared before they get to me. That requires paying people, tax. It requires buying machinery, tax. It requires selling things for profit to chipotle where I got my burrito, tax. It requires sourcing the supplies for the finished product, tax. Then the company that sourced the raw ingredients to finish and sell to the distributor who then sold those ingredients to chipotle. Tax, tax, tax.   1. You need to maintain your restaurant and keep it supplied with clean working equipment that breaks down over time. Repairmen, food service supply distributors, tax, tax, tax.  1. Chipotle is a for profit company they also pay tax on their sales.  When I buy that burrito that 15 dollars gets split up *a lot*  and goes very, very far. Stimulating multiple industries and employing hundreds across dozens of careers.  This is also an insanely shortcuted and over simplified list of the entire network required to get that burrito to me. There are a lot more steps, and a lot more taxes in the supply chain.  If my money stays in my bank account because I cant afford to spend it on that burrito. It has no velocity. Demand decreases slightly if it was just me. But when its the entire population.

"Well for one thing in WWII we (the US) didn't have long range bombers, cruise and ballistic missiles, drones and bases all over the world.  So the navy was very important for transporting troops and equipment across the world.  WWII is when the focus was changing to aircraft carriers and submarines but destroyers and battleships still played a role.  Nowadays battleships are extinct and destroyers aren't as important.  We don't need to launch artillery to hit inland targets we can launch cruise or ballistic missiles from even farther away or just use drones and jets.    In order for ship building to become a factor China would have to have the capability to sink our aircraft carriers and submarines.  Out at sea too, it's not like they have to sit only a few miles offshore to be effective in combat (like in WWII).  I'm not convinced they would be able to do that.  In this hypothetical war there of course is the question of how involved our allies would be.  We do have bases in Japan, South Korea, the Philippines and Guam, so it's not like we would depend on our navy in order to have a presence in Southeast Asia within striking distance of China.

"Both sides were American in the Civil War. Had the Confederacy survived, then we would say that they weren’t Americans any longer.      However, that was a single civil war, and its cause was rectified. China was in a major civil war at the same time, except unlike in the US, where the casualties were around 600k, Chinese casualties during the Taiping Rebellion were over 20 million. Then they had a revolution in the early-20th century that saw China become a republic, the last vestige of it being modern Taiwan. They then fell into another civil war that froze in 1948. After that, China had its Cultural Revolution which saw millions of people die again in the 1960’s. Meanwhile, large parts of it broke off or were carved out of it. Korea, Tibet, Taiwan, Outer Manchuria, and Outer Mongolia were all a part of China relatively recently in history, and only Tibet has been forcibly reintegrated. The US hasn’t seen that kind of fragmentation. The closest comparison was when we allowed our colony in the Philippines its independence.

"""Both sides were American in the Civil War.""   And all sides in any internal conflict in China were Chinese. You're agreeing with me.  ""The US hasn’t seen that kind of fragmentation. ""   The U.S. is \~250 years old. Chinese civilization started around 7000 BCE. That is 28x as long. America's history is 3.5% of China's. And how is that unity within the United States looking?  You're cherry-picking the worst century China experienced for rhetorical utility and intentionally ignoring the point I was making: China will remain China, regardless of government. Whether the United States continues to exist in any fashion in the decades or centuries ahead is far from certain. The U.S. does not have a unified culture; China does. The U.S. is a collection of states which were envisioned as a form of independent nations. There are active secessionist movements in every region, and every region has its own culture and its own interests. Those will not go away if we pretend they aren't there.   ""Unlike in China, the US has democratic and institutional means of removing bad leaders. The fact that there are loopholes in those means that Trump has exploited doesn’t preclude the US from tacking back from an extreme.""  I'm sure the Chinese Communist Party also has a method in theory to remove Xi if they really needed to. Are you taking the position otherwise?  Doesn't mean they have the practical ability to do so, just like Donald Trump can remain in power for the third term he has been constantly talking about if he extends his already existing declaration of national emergency (over fentanyl and immigration) to full martial law.

"**>Yes I know. I guess I was just wondering why we shouldn't discuss both forms of immigration here.<**  If you're willing to have that discussion than we can do that.  **>If the issue is replacing labour lost due to an aging population in the US isn't that addressed both by documented and undocumented immigration?<**  It depends on what you define that type of labor and where the shortages are.  Legal immigrants are filling a combination of jobs, that include high-skill, high-wage jobs.  For the most part, illegal immigrants are filling low-skill, low-wage type of jobs.  Yes, these are jobs that ""*Americans don't want to do*,"" though no one wants to say the *quiet part* aloud.    It is because those jobs just aren't paying enough for Americans to want to do them.  Companies aren't willing to pay higher wages because they have an ample labor supply willing to work for those low-wages.  If we want to ""*increase*"" the wages of those types of jobs, then we need balance out the supply & demand for the labor.  As it is, those companies are exploiting inexpensive labor people and why wages stagnate.  Think about that, when COVID happened and millions of illegal immigrants went back to their home countries because the US economy was stagnated and millions of Americans were collecting unemployment benefits, there was a shortage in labor and when the economy opened back up, many companies were looking to hire people and had to increase wages to do so.  **>It's just when I think of immigration levels I don't only think of legal immigration. So I'm wondering if lower levels of illegal immigration would also factor in here.<**  Want to know what also happens when illegal immigration decreases?  The cost-of-living also balances in many places.  Paying too much for rent?  Paying too much for a new or used vehicle?  Paying too much for groceries?

"The current incarnation of the American republic was created with the Constitution in 1789, and the People’s Republic of China was formally established in 1948. Perhaps you could say 1776 with the Continental Congress’ Declaration of Independence and the later Articles of Confederation prior to the Constitution, but it honestly doesn’t matter. Same with China where you could arguably go back to 1912 with the fall of the Qing Dynasty and the creation of the Republic of China. Going farther back is meaningless in this context. If China can claim an unbroken line of civilization back to the very first borderline-mythical dynasty from thousands of years ago, the US could do the same all the way back to the Magna Carta, the Roman Republic, or even Athenian Democracy and by extension all the way back to Mycenae or the Minoans thousands of years ago. We’re speaking of the current incarnations and latest evolution of these civilizations.       And the “Century of Humiliation” wasn’t the worst in China’s history. The 1200’s and 1300’s where China’s population halved from the Mongol conquest, and was arguably one of the reasons why China was greatly weakened up to 1900’s. To give you an idea of how destructive the Mongol Empire was, Iraq didn’t demographically recover from their Mongol invasion until around 50 years ago. You also forget about the times when China split into multiple warring states and dynasties for centuries on end.      As for cultural unity, both the US and China are ethnically and culturally diverse with a dominant imperial superculture assimilating and unifying them. To this day, people from different provinces in China often can’t fully understand each other as many of their dialects are as close as Portuguese is to Spanish. The US, by contrast, overwhelmingly shares mutually-intelligible dialects of English, with the only exception being a few outlying territories like Puerto Rico, and first generation immigrants.       One of the largest reasons for American national unity and assimilation is due to the relative geographical mobility of the American population. The majority of the Americans migrate across state and regional lines each generation. Even the most secessionist groups of people migrate too much to form a separate majority culture in a given region. For example, over half of Native Hawaiians and two-thirds of Puerto Ricans live in the mainland US.  In many states, like California and New York, the current majority of the population wasn’t born or raised within those states. And although the US has a handful of secessionist movements, none of them hold much support because of the geographical mobility and assimilatory characteristics of that constant mixture above. In any case, all major powers have these regional movements, including China, with its independence movements in Tibet and Xinjiang.      As for what Congress can do. A lot. Especially given that power can change hands every two years. In addition, Congress can impeach the President and order the military to overthrow him, if necessary. The US military may officially have the President as their Commander-in-Chief, but they ultimately swear oaths to the Constitution and the People, not the President.      All in all, our current political instability is an aberration in an otherwise very stable political system, but it’s quite normal to have such events in most major countries. If the Cultural Revolution didn’t break China, Trump won’t break the US. Europe is no better either. After all, how many governments have France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Poland, and Italy each gone through in the past century again? This idea of America collapsing isn’t to be taken seriously.

Here, BKGPrints tries to shift the blame and cast No_Passion as the instigator of hostility, despite the fact that the conversation escalated because of the back-and-forth between their differing viewpoints.  > At one point, BKGPrints says: ""It’s really just sad"" and ""Take care"", which dismisses the other person’s argument entirely, reducing it to a personal attack rather than addressing the topic.  > 2. Deflection Deflection is used when someone diverts attention away from the original issue to avoid answering difficult questions.  > No_Passion_9819 tries to hold BKGPrints accountable with a direct, simple question: ""Do you support disappearing people to El Salvador without due process?"" This question cuts to the heart of a serious policy issue.  > BKGPrints deflects repeatedly, refusing to answer, claiming that the question is a “deflection.” This tactic makes it appear as if the person asking is at fault for changing the subject, even though BKGPrints is the one avoiding answering directly.  > The ultimate deflection is seen when BKGPrints claims, ""I’m not falling for your deflection."" This shifts the focus away from the issue at hand (Trump's immigration policy) and toward accusing the other person of manipulating the conversation.  > 3. Strawman Arguments A strawman argument is when one person misrepresents the other's position to make it easier to attack.  > BKGPrints accuses No_Passion_9819 of discussing illegal immigration when the original discussion was about legal immigration. While illegal immigration is related to the overall immigration discussion, BKGPrints shifts the focus by falsely framing the question as unrelated.  > Another example is when BKGPrints repeatedly insists that No_Passion_9819 is attacking the Trump administration based solely on feelings, rather than facts. This distorts the argument by oversimplifying it as an emotional reaction, rather than engaging with the concrete points raised about Trump’s actions on immigration.  > 4. Whataboutism This is a classic technique of redirecting the conversation to an unrelated issue in an attempt to divert attention from the original problem.  > BKGPrints uses whataboutism when asking No_Passion_9819: ""If not, where was your farce outcry the past four years?"" This implies that criticism of Trump’s immigration policies is invalid unless the person has consistently criticized similar policies under previous administrations. It dismisses the present concern by pointing out alleged inconsistencies in past behavior, without addressing the argument about Trump's current policies.  > 5. Shifting the Burden of Proof Throughout the exchange, BKGPrints places the burden of proof on No_Passion_9819, demanding them to provide detailed sources and responses to counter the ""facts"" they believe they’ve provided, even when No_Passion has already provided sources or made valid arguments.  > ""You have refused from the beginning to discuss any of the merits of the original discussion."" Here, BKGPrints insists that No_Passion hasn't presented anything meaningful, which is not true. This tactic is a way to avoid having to directly engage with the points raised by the other person, while framing themselves as the reasonable one.  > Even after No_Passion does provide articles, BKGPrints dismisses them, accusing them of being irrelevant or illogical.  > 6. Appeal to Emotion (and Intellect) BKGPrints frequently appeals to emotion by attempting to dismiss No_Passion_9819's arguments as merely ""emotional,"" suggesting that they are not based on rationality or data. This rhetorical move is intended to undermine No_Passion’s credibility and shift the conversation to an emotional stance rather than a logical debate.  > For example, BKGPrints says: ""You’re responding based on feelings and you’re not even able to keep track of that to make a valid stance."" This could be an attempt to delegitimize No_Passion's argument without engaging with it directly.  > 7. Projection BKGPrints frequently accuses No_Passion_9819 of engaging in bad faith, suggesting they are being dishonest or not serious about the discussion.  > ""I just know what you're trying to do..."" This is a projection, as BKGPrints is doing exactly what they accuse No_Passion of: avoiding the original topic, shifting the focus, and providing specious reasoning rather than addressing the core issues.  > ""If you truly believe that, why does it matter to you?"" Here, BKGPrints attempts to downplay the significance of the issue No_Passion is raising, indirectly belittling the question’s importance.  > Summary of the Dynamic The conversation is essentially a battle of control over the narrative. No_Passion_9819 is trying to press on specific issues regarding Trump’s immigration policies, but BKGPrints uses a mix of deflection, gaslighting, and strawman tactics to avoid directly addressing those concerns. By insisting on the use of ""facts and data"" while ignoring the presented sources, BKGPrints undermines the legitimacy of the other person’s argument, all while accusing them of being unreasonable or emotional. This tactic can lead to No_Passion becoming frustrated and distracted from the core issue.  > While No_Passion becomes increasingly agitated by the avoidance, they also fall into the trap of repeating the same question, which gives BKGPrints more opportunities to deflect. The underlying dynamic is a stalling game: BKGPrints deflects and sidesteps, relying on the fact that prolonged back-and-forth without resolution often frustrates the other person, leading to a sense of ""winning"" by default.  I will say, asking the yes or no questions is also a form of trying to assert control over the convo. It seems like chatgtp took a side each time. The entire reason I did it was because I thought the other person's response sounded so 1 sided. The original summary was more balanced though.    Overall, you guys should probably just come to an agree to disagree because there is no point in continuing this.",HangryHipppo,2025-04-08T15:07:01,2
"There were only 2 true citation in the full thread, one by each of you.   BKGPrints - Article citing the number he used to reflect historical legal immigration numbers  No\_Passion\_9819 - Article citing drop in illegal immigration numbers  Since BKGPrints post was about how he believed legal immigration number would not drop based on historical evidence he backed the statement with empirical data.

"I see, you are reading every inference to be in favor of BKG. That explains the misread of my comments.   I was talking about immigration generally, and cited two articles, one of which discusses actions taken against legal immigration. Additionally, BKG's source does not speak to whether immigration is going down or not. In fact, it cuts off in 2023, so it is **years removed** from relevancy.",No_Passion_9819,2025-04-08T14:13:01,5

That was my point.  **>In fact, it cuts off in 2023, so it is years removed from relevancy.<**  Years???  Come on, you're coming off naïve and I know you're not that naïve.  You're referring to FY2024, which there's no doubt there's data and will also show what I've said before.
