1) He will do anything on a dare when he's hammered  2) He's a distraction from Elon's shenanigans,twirlingmypubes,2025-04-22T15:16:12,18
Putting a raging drunk in charge of the world's largest military has sure been a great idea.,Tyrannical-Botanical,2025-04-22T15:16:27,8
I doubt it. Hegseth will likely resign to prevent Trump losing face over sacking him.,jamusbondusvii,2025-04-22T15:18:30,3
1. He doesn’t care what anyone else thinks. 2. He doesn’t have to.  Fucking dumb - remove them both.,RedbirdRiot,2025-04-22T15:18:56,2
I am all for an incompetent alchoholic running the pentagon so I hope stays not just for the lulz but because the imperial enforcement apparatus will be less effective globally eroding American hegemony. Sure that’s gonna cause so pain domestically but a lot of relief globally,thapeelllllccc,2025-04-22T15:22:23,2
No. Trump has the emotional volatility of a sleep deprived toddler who doesn’t want to put on pants.,FearlessSea4270,2025-04-22T16:03:22,2
"From the article: 'Pete Hegseth has blamed the “deep state” for a series of problems enveloping the Pentagon'... I guess when you, yourself are as shallow as a sidewalk puddle in downtown Albuquerque, everything seems like a deep state.",Stellar_Stein,2025-04-22T17:19:44,2

Did Obama lose a bunch of dems with the Hagel vote? I didn’t think he was that controversial.,mole_that_got_whackd,2025-04-22T15:53:57,1
"Reason 1 according to the article: > Firstly, it would be an admission that he had been wrong all along.   Reason 2: > It is perhaps also useful for Trump to have unpopular officials in jobs to carry the can as his first 100 days in office are hit by economic uncertainty.",aleph32,2025-04-22T16:09:44,1
But everything is fine. /s,gentleoutson,2025-04-22T16:31:03,1
"Trump need a drunk soulless psychopath at the head of the military. Only a christo-nazi like him will order the army to go after the citizens when the protests will get bigger. Brown people, students, antifa, LGBTQ and else are the next military targets.  In an other news they published a bill last week to make it illegal for us citizens to take videos of the army... Do you really wonder why?",NorthenFreeman,2025-04-22T15:49:58,0
