Donalds is too chickenshite to stand up to Trump. When Trump was going forward with tariffs he was talking about how Trump isn’t going to back down and he fully supports tariffs. A day later when Trump backed down he also supported Trump on that. He’s just a spineless echo chamber for Trump.,AKMarine,2025-04-22T09:25:40,26

"There is no reason for the Hill to include the Dems in this story, AT ALL. They have to bothsides it, so as to not make their 'Daddy"" mad . This was a DONALDS town hall. Story should ONLY be about DONALDS town hall . Not what the Dems do or don't do.  "" But Republicans are not the only ones who have endured tough crowds, as Democrats have also faced frustrated constituents. """,dmp2you,2025-04-22T09:57:31,10
Finally the Dems have a chance to win the Governor's race against this idiot but they will ruin it with a terrible candidate.,crosstheroom,2025-04-22T09:28:13,8

"Donalds relishes this shit.  He knows he’s in a very strong position to win in Florida because of their crazy old population that loves MAGA.  Even now, plenty of supporters down there.  Donalds gets to stand up and play the victim while trying to project strength and gaslight others to “own” them.  The hypocrisy in using his race as a crutch to gaslight others and try to turn the tables on them and whataboutism his way out of that town hall was insane.    It wasn’t that long ago something like that would have doomed a politician forever.  And now?  It’s worn as a badge of honor.  These people have no morals.  No principles.  No loyalty except to wealth and power.  Donalds is exactly what is wrong with politics.  No policy agenda.  No real plan to help his constituents.  It’s all about what he has done for himself, as he eloquently explained last night.  And still, these conservatives will be elected.    Clock is dangerously close to ticking midnight on the ability of the American people to stop fascism from cementing itself for generations.  No other country will be able to save us.  If we aren’t willing to fight to save our nation from the fascists, then we will be lost.  Stand up to power in an organized way.  Don’t make it a short show of a day or two of protests.  Protest daily in every way you can.  Fascism is going to win otherwise.  It’s already taken hold deep within pieces of the government such that we will be losing much of the social safety net soon.",teamdiabetes11,2025-04-22T10:03:16,2

Terrible candidate and no financial support from the dnc.  They see most to all Florida races to be a lost cause so when it comes to governor or congress they spend their money on other races they have an actual chance of winning or can at least contest.,Interesting_Drive_78,2025-04-23T04:27:57,1
