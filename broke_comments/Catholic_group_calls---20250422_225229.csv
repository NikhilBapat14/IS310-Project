"This reminds me of one of my¬†[favorite comments on Christian Nationalism](https://www.reddit.com/r/Reformed/comments/yht3cl/comment/iug0ea7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) at¬†[r/reformed](https://www.reddit.com/r/reformed/) (specifically the third point):  * If the goal of the Christian life were to assume political power (ostensibly for the sake of the Kingdom), wouldn't the lives and ministry of Christ and the Apostles look significantly different than it did? If Jesus did have legions of angels at His command, why not overthrow Pontius Pilate, Herod, and all the way up the chain to Caesar himself until the entire known world bent the knee to Christ in the flesh? Why give Himself up to be falsely accused, tortured, and executed by godless earthly powers? What does a¬†[kenotic Christ](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%202&version=NIV)¬†look like in the Christian nationalist framework? * In the Old Testament, the Israelites heard directly from God through people like Moses, Samuel, and the prophets. Yet they still followed to fail the Law that was given directly from God, and were sent into exile. Without prophets speaking to us directly from God, why would we expect a better fate than them? * Whose Christianity are we talking here with Christian nationalism? Reformed Christianity? Fundamentalist Christianity? Roman Catholic or Russian Orthodox Christianity? Pentecostal, charismatic, prosperity gospel, snake-handling Christianity? What happens if you're the wrong kind of Christian? What happens to the people that aren't Christian at all? Will it be a crime to be an atheist or a Wiccan or a Muslim? Will the ""right kind"" of Christians get special treatment not afforded to everyone else? * How will a Christian nationalist government handle issues like immigration? The Bible is pretty clear on welcoming the immigrant, taking care of the poor, and so on, so I assume social programs will be vastly increased. How will that be paid for? Will taxes go up? If so, on who? Billionaires? The middle class? If not, then how will it be paid for? * How will a Christian government handle the persecution, torture, and execution of Christians overseas? How will it handle Chinese persecution of Christians and the government, or its¬†[blasphemous translation of the Bible](https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/10/chinas-communist-christ/), when a large part of our international trade is with that country? Is a Christian nationalist America prepared to take the economic hit from poorer relations with China? If so, how will it deal with the domestic economic effects? If it doesn't do anything, how will it justify allowing the torture and persecution of Christians it could be saving?  >I think you see the picture I'm painting here.
