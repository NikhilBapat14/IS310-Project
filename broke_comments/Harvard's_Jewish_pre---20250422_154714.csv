We can all see that.  trump also dismantled the envoy to fight antisemitism so everything about fighting antisemitism is just a ruse to oppress the people.,thieh,2025-04-22T15:53:16,59

"Duh.  I'm not saying antisemitism isn't a problem on college campuses, but the maga war on education started LONG before these accusations became front and center.",wifeofsonofswayze,2025-04-22T16:27:23,13
Putin used antisemitism as justification for invading Ukraine and now trump is using it to invade higher education. It’s in plain sight,justliketheriver10,2025-04-22T19:06:36,7
"it’s like russians invading ukraine, to denazify it. what a joke",hhempstead,2025-04-22T21:31:34,4
It’s ironic to me that the new fascists are using antisemitism as their reasoning to oppress. I can’t help but think that it’s in large part do to certain people screaming antisemitism at anything remotely critical of Israel.,Ren_Kaos,2025-04-22T20:50:58,6

It’s a very insidious way of them saying “We’re not like the last Nazis”  But they’re not really saying “we’re not Nazis”  They’re just trying to not look like the last ones by playing this game.,bordumb,2025-04-23T08:34:39,2
I wonder if there is a way Trump can be held personally financially liable for any of these intentional incursions on liberty because money is all Trump seems to respond to.,OhioValleyCat,2025-04-22T17:42:14,2

"It’s not even a ruse  Oppressing people is a fancy college term for bullying, and it’s what Trump does best; you could say he doesn’t know how to live unless he’s punching down against someone or something.",nanobot001,2025-04-22T17:09:03,13
Well he knows about racism.  Harvard has negative quotas against Asians.  Such a corrupt 'institution'...,lilylunalexi,2025-04-23T05:21:22,-1
Trump adopted heritage foundation’s “project esther: combatting anti-semitism” and their agenda using anti-semitism as a cover for stifling free speech etc. I think it’s time  to hold Heritage liable for much of what’s happening since the evidence is documented by P25 and this administration is essentially following that playbook. Non-profits can be sued.,Huge_Excitement4465,2025-04-22T20:44:18,5
