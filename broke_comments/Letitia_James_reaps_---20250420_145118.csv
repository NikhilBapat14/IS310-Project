"Not a good week for Ms. James. One of her county officials is also going after her license to practice law and posted this on X:  ""Today, following allegations of mortgage fraud against her, I have sent a letter seeking disciplinary proceedings to determine whether Letitia James is fit to hold a law license in this state.    I believe she is not and her license should be revoked.""
