"So a president can just ""reverse"" a law passed by congress years after the fact?   Hey, sure, why the fuck not?  It's not like we were trying to run a fucking country here or anything.",IJustLoggedInToSay-,2025-04-21T22:24:38,67
Someone must have told him that BLM is Black Lives Matter.,_grandfather_trout_,2025-04-21T22:10:35,33
"I wish the press would stop with these headlines.  Trump does not have the power to change laws, and acting like his random pronouncements do that plays into his hands. Stop saying he is cancelling, changing or reversing the law--he does not have that power. Instead say he has announced he intends to break the law and that he will not follow the law, which is what is happening.  Journalism 101, people!",econoquist,2025-04-21T23:02:55,11
I figgered the BLM would be the first thing he'd get rid of.  Kinda surprised.,justaheatattack,2025-04-22T00:39:57,3

At this point anyone else concerned that the only reason this administration is targeting these lands is because they are thinking BLM = Black Lives Matter and they are upset.   Kind of like the Enola Gay being purged accidentally.,D3M0N0FTH3FALL,2025-04-22T12:28:57,1

No but since Congress refuses to vote on anything or hold him accountable he basically has free run. We blame Trump but the fact is Congress is enabling everything he does.,sedatedlife,2025-04-21T22:28:24,49

"The BLM (the land one) has been a far right boogeyman for a while now; it was at the epicenter of the Bundy Standoff back in 2014. The USFS, USFWS and NPS to extents as well. But for some reason the BLM has a way of ruffling everyone's feathers from culling wild horses and their balancing act of preservation, conservation, recreation and resource extraction.   I'd put them up there just under the USDAs Wildlife Services as the 2nd most ""controversial"" land management agency in the US.",19chevycowboy74,2025-04-21T22:21:16,18

"Funny, just reading the letters between Timothy McVeigh and a local OKC reporter from ‚Äò95-‚Äò99 and McVeigh mentioned the BLM lands as a point of government over reach  [The Prison Letters of Timothy McVeigh  by Phil Bacharach](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a1265/esq0501-may-mcveigh/)  ‚Äú Re: Trentadue: The crime is bad enough‚Äîbut, as in other cases, it's the subsequent coverup that should give cause for reflection. Look at the Rocky Flats G.J. scandal here in Colorado, or the BLM scandal in New Mexico, or the countless efforts by those who are supposed to uphold the public trust‚Äîto hide the truth, to evade responsibility, and to deter accountability. ‚Äú  Overall I find this point interesting to illustrate the consistent point he sees in all of them.  ‚ÄúTime and again, they (government actors/agency) will protect their own and do whatever is necessary to stonewall and cover up.‚Äù  I think its unfortunate- McVeigh could clearly see the motivations and powers at play, him constantly roasting the posturing by an Oklahoman politician to bring ‚ÄúState Charges‚Äù that would actually have delayed and cost tax payers much more money- while giving the politician free airtime by leveraging the OKC Bombing media clout. It‚Äôs funny and insightful, and I wish he could have used that perceptiveness and apparent communication skills to better the world and be an advocate not a bomber.   Anyway- all that to say, I think it‚Äôs darkly humorous imagining McVeigh, the Unabomber, and 9/11 dude all sitting there. Like a fucked up Goldilocks of terrorists, pick your ideology but it doesn‚Äôt matter.",BuyThisUsername420,2025-04-22T02:00:00,1
