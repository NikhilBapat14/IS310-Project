"Soooo, kidnapping?",Ancient_Popcorn,2025-04-24T07:46:52,28
"Time and time again, we see this regime ignore directives from the judiciary.  They simply do not respect any level of the judiciary below the Supreme Court and Trump is expressing a willingness to battle at that level.  Believing the judiciary can save us from this authoritarian regime is foolish as they have no enforcement mechanism.  This seems yet another example of how a democracy descends into fascism.",CrimsonFeetofKali,2025-04-24T07:49:38,10
"You know who is slowing down the deportation? Trump.  Trump is doing all sort of crazy things to have a show in front of the media, but following the rules is proven to be a faster way. No one would use military aircraft to deport migrants, because it is too expensive. Even for actual military personnel, they take the domestic flight when changing duty location. And due process is a given to every person in the US, and the court is not like millions dollar but more like traiffc ticket.",nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-04-24T07:57:04,7

"Without due process, it's not called ""deportation"".  It's rendition or kidnapping.  The press won't ever get it right, but there it is.",kevendo,2025-04-24T09:43:12,3

The Supreme Court ruled 9-0 against him and here we are so I think he may not respect them either…,NergNogShneeg,2025-04-24T10:56:39,2
