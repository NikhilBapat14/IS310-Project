"Wow. Interesting info.. I have found chat GPTs only purpose. 🙌  Attempting to run for a third term as president could be seen as betraying a consciousness of guilt depending on the context — especially if the individual is trying to avoid legal accountability or consequences that might follow after leaving office.  Here’s how the argument might go: 	1.	Immunity While in Office: Presidents often enjoy certain legal protections or immunities while in office. If someone aggressively tries to retain power beyond the constitutionally allowed terms, it might signal they’re trying to extend those protections. 	2.	Fear of Prosecution: If there are credible investigations or looming legal issues awaiting a former president, trying to stay in office could be interpreted as a way to avoid prosecution — suggesting they know they’ve done something wrong. 	3.	Deviation from Democratic Norms: Willingly violating constitutional term limits can be read as an act of desperation or fear — not just ambition. That fear might be tied to the consequences of stepping down. 	4.	Public Perception: Even if no charges have been filed, the act of clinging to power in violation of law might lead observers to conclude the leader believes they have something to hide — a sort of “if you’re innocent, why not step down?” reasoning.  Of course, this is largely a matter of inference — it’s not definitive proof of guilt, but a circumstantial sign that might support a larger narrative of wrongdoing.

"It's easy enough to see how he's going to do it too.  He's just going to run. And his supporters are just going to argue that the Constitution only forbids him from holding office, not from running. And, given that he controls all the levers of the Republican Party, they'll allow him on the primary ballot.  And he'll win the primary.  Then he's going to insist that he's the candidate and he's going to campaign as such. And states will balk, but the line's going to be that he's the Republican candidate and how dare Democrats try to stop Republicans from putting the Republican candidate on the ballots. Because he's just running, he isn't holding office.  And then, after he successfully rigs it to win, he's going to claim electoral victory, after which Republicans will say that the people have spoken and he's been elected and that anyone who tries to prevent him from taking office is going against the expressed will of the American people. And they'll throw a huge ruckus against anyone who pushes back, one that will make Jan 6th look like a friendly picnic. And the establishment will cave, because they always do.

"Donald J Trump is an insurrectionist, as determined as fact by a court of law. Section 3 of the 14th amendment states that anyone who has previously sworn an oath as an office holder who participates in an insurrection is ineligible to hold office. Period. It's as simple as someone who isn't yet 35, or isn't a natural-born citizen.  The chicken-shit Supreme Court made up rules based on words that don't exist. Nowhere in the amendment does it say Congress must do jack shit to deem someone ineligible. It would be absurd to even think so, as it implies they would need to do the same to prevent anyone under the age of 35 from appearing on the ballot after being nominated by their party.  Trump was in no way legitimately on the ballot and was in no way eligible to be elected. He is an illegitimate president and has no true standing for any act of office.",LibrariansAreSexy,2025-04-24T21:56:32,1

"They are doing so many actually fascist things that can be focused on. They are disappearing people, attacking the press, trying to control who gets educated and what you can teach, alienating all of our allies and elevating the world's worst people.

Like him running in 2028 in a way that is clearly intended to troll us and talk about that instead of him crashing the economy and destroying families. There are things we need to make sure remain the top story right now, Trump 2028 hats are not that.

It's not about a hat. This is the beginning of the propaganda campaign to get people used to the idea of him staying in office. Which is why we need to stop it now.

I also draw hope from the fact that, as I mentioned elsewhere, these are all evil people who are out for themselves at the end of the day, and, once the cracks start to show and Trump reveals enough weakness, they will be at each other's throats to claim his mantle, pulling the rank-and-file their own ways in the wake.",HagbardCelineHMSH,2025-04-24T21:25:49,1
"Another scenario I wouldn't put past Republicans if my collapse theory is wrong is that they would run him as I initially laid out, let him win the election, then decide to follow the Constitution after all by disqualifying him during the electoral vote count.  That would push the selection of president to Congress, which votes by state delegation. Republicans would likely have a clear advantage there and it would enable them to replace Trump with whomever they want.  The advantage of this is that they could run on Trump's popularity with his base instead of running someone riskier from the backbenches.   I'm no expert political analyst or anything, but I'm thinking that if there isn't some sort of internal civil war in Trumpland, I'd imagine this scenario to be the reason why because it would allow Republicans to have their cake and eat it too.",HagbardCelineHMSH,2025-04-24T20:23:50,1
