"I honestly think it's just market manipulation at this point. I'm not entirely sure if Trump wants tariffs or not but I am absolutely sure that Trump wants money, power, and the ability to influence the world's economy with the drop of a tweet.  You can guarantee that anyone in his inner circle is profiting immensely off of this information. I don't think any of them really cares what happens to the US economy as long as they can get rich off of it and control how they get rich, which is exactly what they are doing right now.",Tronn3000,2025-04-09T16:26:09,305
It undermines Trump’s stated purpose of tariffs—to increase domestic manufacturing. Building factories is capital intensive and takes years. That requires proper planning and no one is going to take that risk if tariff rate keeps changing or could be gone in a few years.  The uncertainty it brings into the economy also makes it less likely for people to make capital investments. Want to open a restaurant or a coffee shop or pretty much any business that would be affected by tariffs? How are you going to maintain stable prices if you have no idea how much your inputs are going to cost from month to month. There are things like coffee that we produce only a negligible amount and don’t have the right climate for it.  International trade partners are already starting to look for ways to remove the United States out of their supply chains. It’s a massive gift to the Chinese economy for sure because people want stable trade partners that won’t continuously pull this kind of shit.   Inflation is pretty much guaranteed in the short run because we consume way more than we have the capacity to produce. So businesses will have to eat the tariff since there might not be a way to manufacture it domestically even with high tariff barriers. There are also lots of resources we just don’t have huge reserves of.  Prices will go up but the uncertainty will likely limit growth and create a stagflation type situation.,Randy_Watson,2025-04-09T19:25:41,42
"The US has become an untrustworthy ally.  If you had an acquaintance who was semi-polite to you one minute, then pointing a gun at your head and insulting you the next, then you would treat that person with caution.  That is what Trump has done to the United States.  The US today does not honor its agreements and is prone to cheap insults.  Other western nations would be wise to find ways to detach themselves from the US as much as they can.  Complete avoidance isn't possible, but the relationships need to be kept flexible so that the US ability to project power can be contained.

"Since no one mentioned it, even though it is very likely what made Trump agree to pause the tariffs, it is a sell-off of US treasuries.  TL;DR: Selling treasuries is how the US government gets fresh money. They are (were) seen as an extremely safe investment because of the size of the US economy, the financial stability, etc. Usually, in times of turmoil in the markets, people buy them. But this time around, they sold them, showing that they have lost trust in the US. As a result, interest rates will rise, which will negatively impact investments.  The lost trust in the US is a direct result of Trump's erratic tariffs, but also his behavior towards (former) allies, and it is not easily fixed.   > The market turmoil has rattled administration officials and market participants because it’s the exact opposite of what historically occurs in moments of global economic crisis or volatility. US Treasuries are considered the safest corner of the market. It’s the place investors across the globe flee toward with the assurance that the dominant US role in the global financial system will ensure asset safety.  >**But at the same moment Trump’s tariffs were causing foreign leaders to question the durability of longstanding US security and economic alliances, the rapid selloff of safe-haven assets raised concern that financial markets have similar concerns.**  >Trump acknowledged he’d been watching the bond market, telling reporters after the announcement the market is “very tricky.”  >A spike in yields in the 10-year benchmark was of particular concern for Treasury officials. **When the yields rise, US consumers face higher costs on things like mortgage rates for homes and financing costs for businesses.**   [Source: Treasury secretary's growing concern over bond market turmoil helped drive Trump pause, sources say](https://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-tariffs-cnn-town-hall-04-09-25/index.html)  Here's an analysis from Reuters:  >[The $29 trillion U.S. Treasuries market is the bedrock of the global financial system,](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/global-markets-bonds-trading-analysispix-2025-04-10/) with banks, investors and companies relying on it for funding and access to low-risk assets. Dislocations in the market can cause broader financial stability issues. It can also hamper policymakers’ ability to pursue their agenda, **as a rapid rise in yields can make it punitively expensive for governments to borrow** – a phenomenon called bond vigilantism. In a sign the market was on his mind, **after pausing the tariffs, Trump said the “bond market now is beautiful.”**  A rise in yields could absorb any revenue generated by the new tariffs.  [Here's another analysis](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yrr0e7499o), *after* Trump announced the 90-day pause on tariffs.  >Governments sell bonds - essentially an IOU - to raise money from financial markets for public spending and in return they pay interest.  >The US does not normally see high interest rates on its debt as its bonds are viewed as a safe investment, but on Wednesday rates spiked sharply to touch 4.5%. [...]  >The rise has spooked economists because US bonds are traditionally seen as a so-called safe haven for investors to put their money in times of financial turmoil.  >""Rising bond yields mean higher costs for companies to borrow, and of course governments too,"" said Laith Khalaf, head of investment analysis at AJ Bell.  >""Bonds should do well in times of turmoil as investors flee to safety, but Trump's trade war is now undermining the US debt market,"" he added.  >**While interest rates on US government debt rose, the price of the bonds themselves fell as demand weakened due to investors offloading them.**",Enibas,2025-04-10T04:45:27,11
"Instability. If countries can’t rely on US to export to, then they’ll go elsewhere to do business. Long term(10+ yrs) if American exports increase while imports decrease, something has to change for American products to compete on the global market, ie the value of the dollar. Making it affordable for most countries to buy American goods.

"Couple of ways:  \- Wild price fluctuations. If companies have no clue whether tariffs will be implemented or not, especially well in advance, that could cause supply chain disruptions. Companies might be less willing to buy from their suppliers, meaning they'll be understocked, and their prices could rise as a result. If you don't know whether your products are going to cost more or not, would you want to make any long term business deals?  \- Uncertainty in the stock market. As you might have noticed, the stock market has been fluctuating a lot over this whole saga. People will be less likely to take risks, even if the president is telling them to buy (how this isn't illegal, I'll never know)  \- And then there are the international consequences, where other countries stop taking you seriously and go on and create economic plans without you. If you're not a reliable trade partner, why would they want to do business with you? The only thing America really has to offer the world is a large consumer market.

It puts CEOs and world leaders in the dark. The global economy and global trade needs stability. Trump has turned the both upside down. I don’t even think his inner circle knows what’s going on and what’s coming next.   It seems like trump knows he has the ability to fuck things up on a global scale and he’s doing so for his own amusement. I loved the market going up as much as it did today but how can you trust trump who is acting in such an unpredictable manner for no apparent reason.   As for the impact I would think it would make world leaders and CEOs super cautious since trump is currently too unpredictable. In the end you try not to piss off trump and suffer “the wrath” but you have to save your country or company first. After everything is said and done the USA will lose a lot of credibility and prestige in the eyes of our allies for playing games with the global economy for no reason whatsoever.

You have no idea how bad it is. If you had a masters in economics and worked in the financial sector you would be shitting your pants right now. The changing of tariffs is just one of many things but not the worst. The worst is Trump himself combined with Tariffs but here are some things to watch for that will mean the end of the world and likely escalation to a shooting war.   **Bond yields keep going up -** Typically when the market goes down there is a transfer in wealth from stocks to T-Bills and you see rates go down but right now the bond market isn't doing that. It can mean many things but is primarly means the following   a. People no longer thing the US Economy and Government is a safe place to put your money anymore   b. People are selling their positions faster than people are buying (Countries can be dumping them)  This can eventually lead to the weakening of the US Dollar and worse case scenario the rest of the world no longer thinks the USD is a viable reserve currency.   **USD takes a dive -** As i said above it can be a result of the Bond market movement. This means the USD buys less so things become more expensive. It also means that our goods become cheaper but since everyone has slapped reciprocal tariffs on our goods... it doesnt really matter  **Companies canceling releasing their financial guidance -** This is basically a forecast put out by a company so people get an idea of what at least the management of a company expects to happen. Delta Airlines just cancelled theirs. If this happens investors have no transparency into how a market or company is performing and it is really really hard to figure out the value of a company so most people avoid it or at best devalue it to what they think is worst case scenario. Just imagine how the Stock Market is going to perform if all the Major companies are not putting out their forecasts? How do we price the stock etc... The fact is the market will crash even more if more and more companies choose this route and I suspect Delta Airlines is just the first of many...   All of this just cycles more and more and we end up in a full blown depression / Stagflation and at that point the chance for a physical confrontation to distract is very high.   The only way to fix this is to do one of two things  1. Negotiate deals with all of the countries in the next 90 days including China. All being the key AND FYI the last time Trump negotiated a new deal with Mexico and Canada (replacement for nafta) it took around 2 years... This has to be resolved in 60 days or we are fucked  2. Even if a Deal is made the uncertainty of Trump himself will keep people from reinvesting in the USA unless they have assurances that Trump cannot do it again. If congress does not take his emergency powers away don't expect a bounce back just a not getting any worse than it already is.   Doesn't really matter. in 2026 if we continue down this road the democrats will take the House with +50 and the Senate will look like 56 or so Dem and they just need 10 votes from the Republicans to ram something through veto proof. I am pretty sure there will be a bunch of Republicans willing to take those powers away especially with Trump as a true lame duck President.

I think he'd really prefer an up-only stock market, but since the fed won't lower interest rates, his 2nd best is a volatile uncertain market (which is actually kinda bad for the overall economy but good for swing traders, esp insider traders).

"Yeah, uncertainty about what the next President will do is the natural outgrowth of not having popular support for what you’re doing. Saying one thing during the campaign (only I can stop inflation; I’ll lower prices on day one) and doing the opposite within three months of being elected (tariffs cause price increases, imposing tariffs and saying there will be some short term pain). Uncertainty is also caused by having advisors that are complete idiots (Navarro) and by picking appointees by who is most loyal to Trump rather than on competence (all of them). And, of course, uncertainty is caused by huge changes in the tariff rates every other day. A 10% tariff on everybody is obviously a negotiating position; a 50% tariff is obviously protectionist. That difference is a matter of kind as well as degree. Changes of kind at this point make it obvious that the administration has no long term plan; Trump is just flexing his muscles to see what he can do.

But I don't think he would be better off by sticking to the blanket tariffs he has implemented now, and I think The US would be better off removing the tariffs.   Even if investors did trust that the tariffs, and it was targeted tariffs on specific products, investors has had no warning to start investing in producing in country. And even tho the tariffs makes import more expencive, it's not guarranteed US companies can compete anyways. For example a lot of the goods from China, even if it's doubled in price, US companies might still not be able to compete.  If your argument is that Trump would've been better off if he implemented tariffs on sertain goods and stuck with it, I agree.
