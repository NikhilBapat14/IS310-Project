They have to ask for that help in the form of treatment or a program, typically with involvement from other addicts in recovery, and be willing to do the work involved even when it makes them uncomfortable.

"Part of my job in the Army towards the end of my career was to oversee the handling, use and maintenance of whatever rotary wing fleet the unit I was assigned to flew. We were (and still are) pissing money away at an astonishing (absurd) rate to keep most of the birds flying. These acft the Army depends on are 1980s level tech, and during my career we were still flying and working on ACFT whose airframe had flown during the Vietnam war (2018 was my last year in).  The vendors like Boeing (especially) and Sikorsky are abusing the shit out of the corrupt acquisitions program and we are being ludicrously price gouged for repair parts and raked over the coals with the contracts that require for instance Boeing to maintain their own separate supply chain for ""critical parts"" in theatre and out, where we are paying them for new parts that might only have a loose wire to fix, but costs us 100k+ to get. They charge us criminal prices from things as rudimentary as a small aluminum bracket (which we can create in house for very little but aren't allowed to) for $1,100, and every unit that flies 47s has to keep a handful on hand despite them very rarely needing replacement (takes battle damage or an accident to replace) to one rotor blade that is the same since the 1970s that costs over 300k (in 2028) per blade.  The acft themselves break constantly, so much so that if you can manage to keep an average of 75% of them up as fully mission capable a month - your unit is considered a success.  Now while all this financial rapage is going on, for tactical training units had to pretend they had ammunition in the field - we would joke about it and call it ""pew pew"" (laser gun sounds) bc Uncle Sam didnt have the ability to give us any ammunition.     We aren't at the forefront of anything technology wise either, the tech we get to us is slow af bc the acquisitions program is FUCKed with corruption at every turn, the game is for a contract to be awarded for something new, the project goes over budget and behind schedule, and after a few years of milking the taxpayer they cancel the program.    So why say this? Because for all this spending we are doing, most of it goes into the pockets of well positioned govt leeches and gets drained away like a death of ten thousand cuts before it can provide much of an impact besides business as usual. Business as usual is going to get its ass handed to it.   Bottom line is that for all that money, the US military beyond special forces, relies on its reputation.

Propaganda makes people look more powerful than they are, and situations look less hopeful than they are. The biggest lie they have to sell is that they have majority support and a mandate to do whatever they want. This is one of several base lies the rest are built on. And when you look at any piece of it carefully - it's a house of cards not a fortress. So there is merit to the premise that opposition is still worthwhile and will be effective.   Now we need the dems to acknowledge that this is a class war and start delivering substantive promises to actually financially reform our tax system in a meaningful and permanent way.
