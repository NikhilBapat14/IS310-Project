Imagine if that 239 million went to help the Americans they claim to care about so much instead of stroking trumps ego,cindyx823,2025-04-23T09:03:24,27
"Though I own a small amount of stocks in at least one of them (and doing terribly may I add), I do hope they ALL experience the Trump effect!     Snippet:  >   Pilgrim‚Äôs Pride Corp., a major poultry producer, donated more than any other individual or company, sending $5 million to Trump's inaugural committee. Just behind was Ripple Labs, the cryptocurrency and blockchain company, which gave almost $4.9 million.  >A handful of energy companies gave at least $500,000 each ‚Äî including Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Shell and Occidental Petroleum Corp., as well as the political arm of the American Petroleum Institute.  >Artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency companies ponied up too with similar donations, including Solana Labs, Open AI CEO Sam Altman, Ripple, [C3.ai](http://C3.ai), Coinbase, Galaxy Digital Services, Perplexity AI.  >Amazon and Meta each donated $1 million. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg¬†[attended Trump‚Äôs inauguration](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/elon-musk-jeff-bezos-mark-zuckerberg-attend-trump-inauguration-rcna187642)¬†and received prominent seats in the Capitol Rotunda, where Trump was sworn in after bad weather scuttled the traditionally outdoor event. Apple CEO Tim Cook gave $1 million, as well.  >Computing companies Micron, Nvidia, Qualcomm and Microsoft also made six-figure donations, as did health care companies such as Hims, Johnson and Johnson, Merck, Pfizer and Amgen. Live Nation donated $500,000, and two online gambling companies DraftKings and FanDuel each gave just under that.  >Other major donors include those with ties to the Trump administration, including some who eventually were tapped by the president for major administration roles.",Silent-Resort-3076,2025-04-23T09:01:10,5
"If the founders designed the legislative branch as the most passive, yet most powerful branch that relies on the power of the people, why can industry override that by just paying Congress and the Executive? It takes away the whole concept and leads us to the same corruption that brought down Rome.   Citizens are united when we all vote, not through a ""Citizens United"" money laundering scheme for foreign governments, industrial interests, and dark money.",happyfundtimes,2025-04-23T09:05:38,4

"Yet, people are somehow surprised that the only executive orders and laws coming out are ones that directly improve the bottom lines of these corporate interests.   A first grader could tell you that coal is dirty but when a politician touts ‚Äúclean, beautiful coal,‚Äù gets wealthier, and opens up our national parks to more mining leases, people struggle to see the connection. Much less do anything about it.",TheRedheadedMonster,2025-04-23T09:07:03,2
"I‚Äôll be looking through the list of donors to see if I spend money at any of these companies and will be adding them to my personal **permanent** boycott list.

What is that money actually used for? I always see these insane amounts of money flowing from one party to another but i never see what costs are actually being described.

"But Americans are the ones who gave those companies the money in the first place. And democrats continue to give their money to these same companies, so it's really like democrats are bribing trump at this point. Maybe if democrats grew a spine and stopped being such giant hypocrites, we could actually begin to effect some change around here. Instead they will continue to complain about trump on twitter while drinking starbucks and waiting on a package from amazon. They're worse than republican christians at this point.¬†",Bakedads,2025-04-23T10:13:56,-6
"Boycott all of them. Disrupt their money flow to private equity and other global industrial organizations. They're trying to corrupt NZ, Canada, ad the EU. They already got the UK with Brexit. They got the US. They got Georgia. They're trying to expand their network before they die, no matter who it hurts. They all need to be trialed for crimes against humanity.   Keep industry out of politics. If industry can't operate without invading every facet of society and taking away the laws that kept our children out of the mines and lead out of paint, then they shouldn't be able to operate. I guarantee you they do not let their own children work in a mine, yet it is okay if the ""commoners aka out-group"" does it.   Sick oligarchy. Aristotle warned us about these people...and we wonder why history and humanities are taken out of schools.",happyfundtimes,2025-04-23T09:09:26,6

"Ha! The idea that democrats would actually stand by their principles by boycotting evil companies is laughable. Democrats will complain about labor rights on twitter while drinking starbucks and ordering packages on amazon. They are a bunch of unprincipled hypocrites.
