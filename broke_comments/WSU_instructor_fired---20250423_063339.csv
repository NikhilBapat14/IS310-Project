"Good. They shouldn’t be able to hold a teaching job ever again anywhere. As far as their career goes, it should be over.   Time for them to flip burgers or become a cashier at Target.",ITrCool,2025-04-23T06:56:14,73
"Good. The left need to feel the repercussions of their actions. Assaulting people wearing red hats, vandalizing Teslas, and rioting need to stop and people doing these things prosecuted.",StillTruthSeeking,2025-04-23T06:57:31,66
I’m amazed that he was fired. I was expecting some kind of sensitivity or anger management training. Another surprising thing was how fast he was fired. Only several weeks. Usually they drag things out until the people involved have moved on and they can memory hold it.,johnnyg883,2025-04-23T09:07:28,22
"I saw a video about this the other day on X.  This guy was lying through his teeth to the police when he was questioned about the assault, and he was obviously pissing his pants. I guess he wasn't smart enough to realize there were cameras all around the pub where he and his friend beat up that student with the Trump cap.",California-Cowgirl,2025-04-23T07:57:16,26

"tbh, the guy's phd probably was heading that way anyways.  :D",j3remy2007,2025-04-23T07:19:51,26
I know right? Political violence is not ok. Can you imagine the lib freakout if we were torching car dealerships nationwide under Biden?,Dewalt-Shampoo,2025-04-23T10:36:48,18
True. Time for the guy to realize he just wasted years of his life pursuing a worthless degree and now has lost his career while failing utterly to show self control and maturity as a grown adult.,ITrCool,2025-04-23T08:20:57,17
