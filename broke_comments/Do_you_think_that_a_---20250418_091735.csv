"If the point is to move along the position of the majority, what would be the purpose of a neutral party?",Velvet-Drive,2025-04-18T09:50:22,21
I'd rather go with the German model where the minority whip has the ability to bring bills to the floor,discourse_friendly,2025-04-18T10:21:32,14
"A chairperson does not preside over a company or an organization to be fair or neutral, they preside to get the job done the way they want it done.  So they would favor their own people, or the people that would get the job done the way they want it done, in that case.  The US Speaker of the House (which I presume you are referring to) does the same thing.",mdws1977,2025-04-18T09:42:49,7
I think that giving the speaker the power to control which items are on the agenda gives that person far too much power. It eliminates most ability to have cross-party legislation - yet we know that national opinion often crosses party lines.,MoonBatsRule,2025-04-18T10:04:14,3
"No offense intended, because I see what you are getting at, but making a change like what you are suggesting here would require a complete overhaul of our current system.   And if we were to completely overhaul our current system (which I’m totally on board for), it makes sense to make much deeper and more significant changes, such that this particular change wouldn’t be necessary.",PlantfoodCuisinart,2025-04-18T10:25:02,3
"In my country (Serbia) the speaker runs the legislature as a kangaroo court, shouts down the opposition, hands out fines against political opponents when she feels like it, and regularly abuses parliamentary procedure to move along illegal and dubious bills without debate. So yeah, I do think the speaker should be politically neutral. A politically-biased majority speaker makes the minority literally irrelevant. Democracy is not in fact being totally non-existent if you aren't the majority party.",persistentInquiry,2025-04-18T15:46:55,3
It makes no sense for the speaker to be a neutral party. The purpose of the head of a legislative body is to ensure the agenda of the party that is in majority moves forward.  Making this position neutral would just be adding an unneeded layer of bureaucracy to a system already swamped with such obstacles.,cromethus,2025-04-18T12:34:53,2
"“A good speaker would follow the Constitution, uphold the agreed-upon rules, let everyone read the bills and genuinely participate, keep the House transparent and accountable, and mainly stay out of the way as America’s elected representatives draft, debate, and amend legislation.  “They’ll never stop to consider that the reason it’s so hard to elect a speaker—who is an officer of the whole House, not one party—is precisely because the speakership has become something it was never intended to be. No one would care who’s in charge if the speaker stuck to neutral process. The House has a parliamentarian, appointed by the speaker since 1927, who sometimes makes major rulings on process. Other than myself and a few others, no one even bothered to learn who that person was when I served.  “... in the House of Representatives the parliamentarian is the one practically making the rulings, because the speaker has completely abdicated the responsibility. Not once do I recall a presiding officer (who officially rules) rejecting the “guidance” of the parliamentarian. This is connected to my broader point about the dysfunction in the House: The parliamentarian has become the speaker lite, and the speaker has become the majority leader.”  - Former Congressman Justin Amash (L-MI)",Pariahdog119,2025-04-18T13:18:57,2
"> In Britain, the speaker is a bit tough but ultimately seen as quite neutral  While true, the role of the Speaker of the House of Commons runs a bit deeper, only they select which amendments go forward for each bill. They also hold the tie breaking vote, which according to Speaker Denison's rule will always opt for further debate or the status quo. They are also the sole approver of ""Money Bills"", matters relating to taxation. The upper chamber cannot block or amend these bills.  The speaker is actually in charge of the Palace of Westminster, all the staff therein, and is the representative for MPs to the Queen, and House of Lords.  They are sworn in by the Monarch themselves, all other MPs are sworn in by the Speaker.  Also, because the speaker is strictly non-partisan, none of the main parties stand candidates in their seat during elections.  There are two Deputy Speakers, the principal Deputy is Chairman of Ways and Means committee and Committee of the Whole House",epsilona01,2025-04-18T16:35:45,2
"It depends on what power they have. Will the speaker be able to control the agenda? If so, personally I'd say it should be partisan, because weather you like it or not, the speaker will have some sort of bias. The other reason why I think it should be partisan is they do ""speak"" for the house. No matter who you are, not all 435 members are going to like you. If the majority find you acceptable to speak, I think that should be grounds to hold the speaker position.     To answer your question. No, I think the speaker should be partisan. I think it's too idealistic to believe the speaker can be neutral while holding any real power and I think keeping it partisan is the best way to represent the House's values.",RemoteFungus470,2025-04-18T09:35:29,3
"It is definitely beneficial for them to be neutral. Only having 2 parties kind of makes that impossible though, unless it were a federal employee with no voting power rather than an elected official with his own agenda.",bjb406,2025-04-18T09:42:58,3
"The speaker should enforce a basic decorum and the general rules of the house. The majority already has the benefit of proposing government bills,, majorities on comittee etc.  The speakers job is to heard the geese.",ReverendRocky,2025-04-18T20:15:22,1

"at first a speaker is a person, a person has opinion, he/she may not control it has perfect neutral position. 2 party system right now seems very balanced between efficient and fair.   Democratic is normal distribution, it should be dynamic balanced. Right now as long as the power is separated, speaker of legislature can be tilted to help the majority, if it doesn't work, the parameter will change so the majority will shift just like the normal distribution shift left or right.",Electronic_Bicycle32,2025-04-19T12:54:42,1

"This is kind of just semantics.  If the US Speaker was just a ministerial position, the majority party would still have some sort of leader steering its agenda. They'd just be called Majority Leader or something like that.  To what extent is there a meaningful difference? On procedural issues, they have the Parliamentarian to consult.",bl1y,2025-04-18T12:58:02,0
"Democrats have long appointed “neutral” figures to positions of power and it’s been awful.  Merrick Garland was Obama’s pick for supreme court justice but Mitch McConnell. He’s a centrist. It was though everyone would be satisfied with him. But Mitch Mcconnell blocked his confirmation because “it’s an election year” and then rushed through 2 of Trump’s nominees during an election year a few years later.  But Democrats still wanted their Lukewarm centrist guy to get everyone to get along. So Biden appointed Merrick Garland attorney general.  And Garland decided, in his englightened centricity, to not investigate Donald Trump for Jan 6, thinking everyone could just move past Trump. Then Trump announced his 2024 campaign and gained traction, only then did Garland begin his investigation, a YEAR late, and Trump was elected before the investigation was finished. And Garland made it look incredibly partisan by waiting until Trump was polling well in the 24 primary before he started the investigation…",Y0___0Y,2025-04-18T17:38:29,0
Clarification: A neutral chairperson would not just automatically move along the majority's position or the minority's position. If they were expressly partisan they might be much more likely to advance one side than another.,Awesomeuser90,2025-04-18T09:54:33,3

"There are some things that could be done without too much difficulty. A secret ballot used whenever anyone wants to elect a speaker or remove one, a majority of the members being required to agree to remove a speaker, not merely a majority of whoever is present and shows up to vote, needing at least say a third of all the members to ask for a vote of removal, a rule so that the top two candidates (by number of sponsors), as well as anyone else with say 1/20th of the Reps in favour of sponsoring them (nobody can sponsor more than one), go onto the ballot paper, and if nobody has a majority of the valid votes then they drop the least voted candidate and vote again, and each party must use a secret ballot (even if only to say yes or no) in order to hold votes among themselves who they rally around.   I think that would be a good starting point for making the speakership at least somewhat less contentious.",Awesomeuser90,2025-04-18T10:32:40,1

We are well past the moment where incremental changes intended to improve our current system is a relevant conversation to be had.    Not intending any disrespect to you, because I understand the good faith here, and I admire the optimism. I think though that we are better served by a more clear-eyed assessment of our current situation.   There are no good actors in our government.

How would fusing the legislature and executive relate to the neutrality of the speaker?,Awesomeuser90,2025-04-20T19:09:05,1
That doesn’t make the previous commenters point less valid.  It may be impossible to do today but they are just trying to spitball a solution FIRST.     You don’t have to redo our entire political system to make this work.  Simply allowing someone out side of the majority party  to bring  a motion to the floor on an alternating basis with the majority party should improve things.  The majority party should not be slowed down too much for legislation that the majority of the house supports as they could quickly deny the motion.  It would gum up the works when the house is beholden to extremist as it is today.  It may even improve bi-partisan behavior by encouraging discussions between minority and majority party as the minority party would want to find willing partners in the majority party.  The key is to weaken both political parties.,Upbeat_Capital_8503,2025-04-19T09:04:35,2
"For reference: this is all about Britain   The speaker can call on questions after the reading of bills etc, and decide which amendments are selected for consideration. But due to how our system it’s set up, it’s the government who drive forward what bills are introduced and get voted on. There are 20 opposition days per parliamentary session (which last about a year), 17 reserved for the official opposition. There are then a few days for Private Members Bills. Due to pure amount of time allocated, regardless of the neutrality of the speaker the governments (majority’s) agenda is pushed forward.  Fusing the executive and legislature allows the executive to dominate the legislature. The executive decides on nearly all the bills that are introduced, then the whips make the government (majority party) vote for them. In terms of advancing one parties agenda, this has a far greater impact than the speaker being technically neutral",MiddleAndLeg_,2025-04-21T05:49:24,1
"> The key is to weaken both political parties.  In what scenario do you see this being viable?   Because the parties who you are intending to perform this action, are the exact parties would be negatively impacted. Additionally, they are the people whose craven self satisfying behavior is why we think we would need this solution. So they won't do it.  I don't understand how anyone can pay any attention to the last 40 years of American politics, and think that this is happening without a massive political shift which would render the need for this obsolete.",PlantfoodCuisinart,2025-04-19T09:44:53,1
"You could do things like figure out how many slots there are, IE how many things can be debated or voted upon in a week, and then give the MPs a ballot at the start of each week and they can vote, such as using Single Transferable Vote, to choose which of the motions submitted should be heard that week.   That would make the agenda far more decided on by the whole parliament and not just the ministers and whips while making the speaker independent and neutral.",Awesomeuser90,2025-04-21T14:46:52,1
"The problem with the party system is that it place party needs before what is best for the country.  The fact YOU can’t see it surprises me unless you’re an extremist from either party and don’t like compromise between parties.  It’s a problem for both parties but is painfully clear today with the current Republican Party house dysfunction.  This is only one of many, many example (Pelosi is another example when the party exerts too much control over its members).  You can weaken the party system by not allowing them to manipulate the process.  For example, in California, there is an open primary system.  The top two vote getters go into the general election so you can have two democrats, two republicans or occasionally the independent slips in when one party is non existent in an area.  This means that far left and far right extremist are more likely to lose the general election especially in areas where one party is weak because if an area is only 20% or 30% of one party, they will side with the more moderate candidate.  There are plenty of other examples.",Upbeat_Capital_8503,2025-04-21T12:05:55,1

"Ok.   Again, it’s the same problem.   I appreciate that there are levers available within the system at the state level that allow the voters some level of control over not just the parties but the process itself.   Now I’m hoping you can come with me to see that the federal government has no similar controls in place. The rules of the House for example are set by the House members. The voters have no federal version of a state level ballot initiative which we can use to change the system.   What you are doing is pointing to a system that has a feature that has allowed the voters to force a change onto an elected body that reduced the power of the members of that body. Now you want me to accept that the same thing is possible in a system in which no similar ability to alter the rules of the governing body is available to the voters.   It doesn’t work. My point stands. You are requesting that the system regulate itself. It won’t. These people won’t vote against their own best interests. They won’t put the country above themselves. It’s why they are still allowed to legally trade on inside information despite that being illegal to every other person in the country.",PlantfoodCuisinart,2025-04-21T14:16:09,1
