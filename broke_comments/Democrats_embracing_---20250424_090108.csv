"I’m going to be naive for a moment, where on Earth did Jasmine Crockett come from? I have never heard her name and for the past three months or so she’s all over the place. What’s her claim to fame besides just being, apparently, a lunatic?",Captain-Triangle,2025-04-24T09:09:31,54
“The work stuff isn’t working. We got our asses handed to us in the last election cycle…anybody have any ideas?”  “Let’s double down on the woke stuff!”  “Aces!”,Creeepy_Chris,2025-04-24T10:56:17,16
"99.9% of Democrat strategy is ""cry louder and longer until you annoy people into giving you what you want.""  And to their credit, it's worked for 50 or so years.  But it's disappointing that after a almost decade of them being told that this no longer works, their only response - **ONLY** RESPONSE - is to just cry louder and longer.",NotAnotherRedditAcc2,2025-04-24T09:23:53,21

"Regular ""woke"" is endless riots, burning whatever they dont like, and assault if not outright murder of those the don't like.  What does ""dark woke"" look like?",Dpgillam08,2025-04-24T09:55:47,3

Crockett might actually be worse than MTG,agk927,2025-04-24T10:03:42,-11
"While she's in the House from Dallas she isn't originally from Texas, grew up privileged in the St Louis area, attended expensive schools. Picked up her foul mouthed routine not long ago in order to seem ""more real"". Actually served in the Texas legislature but spoke quite differently then.",New_Ant_7190,2025-04-24T12:06:30,26
She's got a really big mouth with no guardrails and the MSM is addicted to stupid soundbites.,social_dinosaur,2025-04-24T09:23:47,53
DEI hire is her claim to fame. Literally says she was hired because she’s black. I was just looking at one of her posts of her running her mouth and saying basically nothing and the entire thread was praising her and saying she’s a national treasure and a queen. I can’t stand her and should be no place for her fake hood rat act as someone that’s supposed to be a representative for the government.,Nervous-County2713,2025-04-24T09:30:06,4
"Now that they don’t have government funding sources to pedal crony seedy election scandals (bye USAID), they’re in a bad position for 2026. Money won’t be flowing as easily as before.",ITrCool,2025-04-24T09:48:17,11

They may end up snagging the house but Republicans have the senate down pat,agk927,2025-04-24T10:07:49,-3
"So, democrats.  I hate it when the “moderate democrats” still vote democrat but blame all the craziness on “these other democrats” who have taken over the party, and that is to be ignored because “the moderate democrats” are still secretly in control and have it all handled.",OzoneLaters,2025-04-24T09:23:45,24
The loud mouth fits but Crockett passed the bar exam apparently. MTG loses here imo.,GamnlingSabre,2025-04-24T10:49:46,8
"Thank you for that information; I didn’t know that! It’d be a shame if by “spoke differently then” the implication was with more, well, class. If that isn’t the fame (infamy) going to her head, I don’t know what is.",Captain-Triangle,2025-04-24T12:19:49,7

"“Literally says she was hired because she’s black.”  As in, Jasmine HERSELF said that?",Captain-Triangle,2025-04-24T11:11:16,17
"Yes, they still vote Democrat but this post is about the crazy lunatics of the far left that do this things with the far left supporting it. The Party is now run by the far left, but the rest of the Democrats don’t change their votes because of it. I’m a former Democrat, but no way I can ever vote that way again, especially after 2020. So I’m one that leaned right of many Democrat voters, but now I’m far right to the Democratic platform.  Also people forget about Independent voters. They have been moving right as well based on the choice between the Democratic and Republican platforms and what makes the most sense for them and their families.",Lifeisagreatteacher,2025-04-24T12:07:09,1
It’s what makes it funny. Crocketts public persona is performative. She is from an upper middle class family and went to prestigious schools.   Her public demeanor is for show. ,Texas103,2025-04-24T11:33:53,6
"Yes but MTG isn't a lawyer, she is/was in the construction business, as in building things.",New_Ant_7190,2025-04-24T12:13:15,4
"Yes, she spoke quite differently then. But she's been privileged in her political career, too. An outgoing Democrat member of the Texas legislature essentially selected her to run for/take that seat. Then there's the video where she explains how she got her first job in the DA's office. She said that her qualification was being black.",New_Ant_7190,2025-04-24T12:25:41,5
Yes. She has a video saying just that.,New_Ant_7190,2025-04-24T12:07:24,11
