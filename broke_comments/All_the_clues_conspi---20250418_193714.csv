"She has the money and the need for attention that she did go up there. However, none of them went to space, they were in an upper part of the atmosphere that was a bit further, then they take the plane to for 0gs. Im more ticked they keep calling themselves astronauts, etc, when they are not. Its a spit in the face to real ones.",AtomicFox84,2025-04-18T22:27:12,31

There is way too many people caring way too much about this.,r4d4r_3n5,2025-04-18T20:15:22,50
"If you think space is fake, that space travel is some sort of satanic ritual, or you spend time flipping patches, logos, and words around to find hidden meanings, you're a blithering idiot.",squunkyumas,2025-04-18T20:25:52,36
I think if they just did it for a fun ride there wouldn’t be any controversy around it. The big issue is that they tried to take a thrill ride and make it into some overblown social statement and grand achievement.,Dr_Juice_,2025-04-19T09:55:05,2
The flight was real. The fake part was what was inside the capsule.,melie776,2025-04-19T07:19:12,2

"Look if the blue origin people wanted to do a publicity stunt showcasing their new fancy thing then whatever that’s what businesses do.  If they get celebrities to go along for the ride then fine, again common thing to happen.   Where this goes sideways is when they consider this sone big feminism moment.  Why? They sat down. That’s it.  Maybe showcase some of the women involved in making the thing, or actual women astronauts maybe? I’m just glad that finally most of society is saying “no this is stupid” it’s long overdue",chillthrowaways,2025-04-20T19:10:40,1
"This one is wild:  ""Users on X claimed the patch, when turned upside-down, shows the he figure of Baphomet""  https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/18/20/97313925-14626473-Users_on_X_claimed_the_patch_when_turned_upside_down_shows_the_h-a-48_1745006146083.jpg",Ironman650,2025-04-18T19:41:42,0
"I agree completely, but I don’t think they are arguing that space is fake on this particular issue, they’re arguing that the claim that this specific crew went to space was fake.   That said, dailymail is garbage journalism, and all of this evidence is thin at best.",komatsu-D355a,2025-04-18T22:54:31,9

"Daily Mail is light years better than the trash news media we have here.   They report on what our media wants to keep hidden from the public, and they are typically first to break a story.",Ironman650,2025-04-19T02:00:18,3
"Sometimes. You’re right. There’s also a huge amount of speculation and jumping to conclusions that doesn’t make for quality journalism. That happens when you rush to be the first instead of taking time to verify facts. They all do that these days, but dailymail does it a LOT.   Again, I want to state that I don’t disagree with anything in this particular article.",komatsu-D355a,2025-04-19T14:30:34,2
