So the trump thing was just to distract from her own fraud and embezzlement and “creative accounting” while simultaneously winning points from the TDS crowd. Got it.  Lock her up!,Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-04-22T20:41:53,12
"The left is trying so hard to make this as illegitimate as her looking into Trump was and claiming it was a case of having the person then looking for the crime, and it is nothing at all like that. Skipping for a minute the fact that Trump was innocent and she most definitely isn't, this isn't driven by Republicans looking for payback.  I hope she was right when she claimed no one was above the law. It's obvious that she didn't believe it for herself.",JustinCayce,2025-04-22T21:19:58,10
