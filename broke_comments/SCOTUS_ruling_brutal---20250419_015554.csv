"One thing consistent about the GOP is that their public reasoning operates in a legal vacuum. They have become accustomed to their followers believing anything they say without the need for evidence or any basis of legal precedence. They seem to think if they say things enough times, it will become reality. While this works well with their gullible right-wing followers, they can't accept it doesn't work in the real world of law. Witness the multitude of legal failures to contest the 2020 election results.  They can use the tried method of A+B=C. But they stifle the fact that A and B can be patently false details which allow them to arrive at their final conclusion. Most of their usage is blatant, including this one.   They say the defendant was a member of a gang with no offering of proof, other than the cockamamie, blatantly modified photo of his finger tattoos. Then to declare that he was found to be a terrorist, without any judicial participation presumes they have the legal authority to make these decisions on their own. If both factors are false, then the conclusion is just a desperate reach, as witnessed after the previous election loss.  This isn't about the defendant. It's about arrogantly pushing to remove barriers to extrajudicial actions. It's part of a classic dictatorial effort to remove legal and intellectual obstacles to tyranny. If you amass a sufficient legal workforce to challenge every move they attempt, you slow down the wheels of societal deterioration. Their legal players are not much more skilled than those who continually lost cases in 2021, with zero evidence.   The real obstacle is the corruption behind some of the SCOTUS players. The more moderate members are growing tired of the vacuous arguments based on extremist, outdated legal history, with Roberts, Kavanaugh, and Barrett showing less tolerance. If the administration, mainly Stephen Miller, ignores SCOTUS, then the nation has entered a new, dark phase of authoritarianism. You have to wonder if the extremist movement will outlive the current figurehead.",Inevitable-Peace7,2025-04-19T08:16:52,30
Is this the same SCOTUS that has been kowtoing to the Orange Blob?,Past_Situation,2025-04-19T20:34:44,2
"The good thing about these movements is, as you ponder, that they usually disintegrate quickly after the Messianic figurehead is out of the game, as the gormless subordinates struggle for control of something they have absolutely no skill to control. There is, right now, nobody that can be seen as a heir to Trump so should his health give out, MAGA would crumble.  The main issue is, I fear, that the damage has been done and that the loss of a movement that, as despicable as it is, channels and unites the far-right, would lead to a spike of frustration on the part of that segment of population that enthusiastically supports the hatred and violence being peddled by the current administration. Most of those people would probably be eventually reabsorbed by more moderate groups, but there would be most certainly some driven to what at that point could only be called domestic terrorism.  As usual, both the media and the public at large severely underestimate how long in the future we'll have to deal with the societal consequences of what is happening right now. It's maddening, considering the plethora of examples we have from the last century and the current, of countries who fell under the spell of this kind of politics, the myriad of ways this affected their populace and how those countries are faring now.",Weird-King6449,2025-04-19T14:07:28,7

They have done a lot of super crappy things and conservatives sit at the majority.  But Sotomayor wrote this statement and she made sure it war very clear how dangerous this was.,Independent_Fox8656,2025-04-19T20:51:33,4
