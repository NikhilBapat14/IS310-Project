He ran on being revenge against the United States itself.  People voted for him thinking he was only going to target Democrats.

"It's genuinely shocking that Sarah Huckabee Sanders is now reduced to begging Trump for basic disaster relief, knowing full well he once withheld funds because people were fans, a truly disturbing pattern, and it makes you wonder, what *exactly* is motivating his actions toward FEMA and its role in disaster response, particularly given how his actions put vulnerable communities at risk?",Tremenda-Carucha,2025-04-23T12:36:28,158

"Trump cares about Trump, that’s it. He told everyone on the campaign trail that he didn’t give a shit about them, but just wanted their vote.
