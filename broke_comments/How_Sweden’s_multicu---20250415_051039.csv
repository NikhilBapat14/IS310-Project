"God bless countries like Poland that saw this shit for what it was. About immigration, Charlie Munger said Angela Merkel ""Thought she was leading a parade until she looked back and saw no one was behind her.""",OliverMonster1,2025-04-15T08:30:23,204
"More like ""experiment"" and we don't need the likes of Telegraph to tell us what we've been saying for decades. That's why you only see Islam even mentioned in the **comments** of the article.",Right_Archivist,2025-04-15T05:43:05,240

"A slow-motion cultural suicide. Sweden is barely recognizable today. How will it look in another 25 years? The elite would rather no one ask the question. The Swedish Democrats, routinely vilified as ""fascists"" by that same elite, are desperately trying to save what's left of their country.  Just remember folks, Sweden is a microcosm of the rest of western Europe. They're just a little further along in their experimental quest for a multicultural ""paradise"" than France, Britain, Germany, Holland, Belgium, Italy, and Spain. But the writing is surely on the wall. The only thing these countries will have in common with their once rich cultural heritage is language and geography....and perhaps not even language.   If you look at the migrant communities in Holland for example (mostly Moroccan), they all have satellite dishes pointing to the Persian Gulf so they can watch Al Jazeera or Al Arabiya. Many are entirely uninterested not just in Dutch culture, but in learning to speak Dutch. What does that tell you about the future? At what point will Holland bifurcate into a dwindling and aging, Dutch-speaking, soon-to-be minority and a young, fertile, growing, Arab-speaking, soon-to-be majority? It's literally happening before our eyes.",Vessarionovich,2025-04-15T05:13:55,195
Who could've possibly seen this coming? Tossing in a bunch of foreigners with radically different cultural values to you could cause a problem? No way... üôÇ,____IIIII___ll__I,2025-04-15T06:24:44,183
Sweden is feeling the cultural ‚Äúenrichment‚Äù allright.  Constant knife crime and at least one grenade attack every few weeks.,Royal_IDunno,2025-04-15T09:21:26,59
"""When I moved to Sweden, I knew only the drug trade. I moved there for a new start. I embraced being poor, got roommates, worked at a metal shop for a decade and despite being broke and my health failing, I was glad to leave the ease of money as a criminal."".   said no one ever, okay maybe one.   The rest immigrated their ways also, so why shocked Pikachu face?",MaliciousTent,2025-04-15T21:08:51,7

"I guess you haven't watched the news about Poland recently. Ukrainian/Georgian gangs killing people, Germany smuggling in refugees late at night, 40-50 migrant centers opened and the incoming migration pact. If conservatives won't win the 2025 elections then Poland will be fucked.",Beautiful_Crow4049,2025-04-16T00:18:37,7

"Sometimes the ""there"" is fine to bring here....it all depends on the ""there"". That's what neither the multiculturalists NOR the xenophobes seem to understand. The blending of peoples and cultures can be a beautiful thing.....or it can be an unmitigated disaster.....depending on the relative compatibility of the cultures in question. Quite evidently, Islam is NOT compatible with our culture of freedom.",Vessarionovich,2025-04-15T15:15:37,21

Wanting to preserve your culture and traditions and maintain the sovereignty of this culture does not make you a xenophobe or any other ‚Äòphobe‚Äô.,Delicious_Physics_74,2025-04-15T16:31:07,22
A day? Did hear something like once a week but a day!? I bet the mainstream news didn‚Äôt touch things like that.,Royal_IDunno,2025-04-15T14:03:57,14
The mainstream news media is heavily left wing and because of that they lie all the time about things and don‚Äôt report on crimes being committed by non natives so to speak.  It happens all the time in my country they won‚Äôt even bother to report on the mass Muslim rape gangs going about the country.,Royal_IDunno,2025-04-16T06:06:30,5
"I agree.  On the other hand, fearing contamination from other cultures for no rational reason IS xenophobic. If one believes in human freedom and the equality of all before the law, there are plenty of rational reasons to fear Islamic culture. The same does not apply to Hindu culture or Buddhist culture. There is nothing in these cultures that are innately antithetical to human freedom. Too bad the same can't be said for Islamic culture.",Vessarionovich,2025-04-15T18:38:55,10
