"[Victor Davis Hanson](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/victor-davis-hanson) reviews the current state of higher education and the Trump administration's push to advance campus reforms. Citing issues of ballooning administrative costs and tuition, politicization, and civil rights, he argues that ""if there are protracted standoffs \[between the federal government and university leaders\], our elite campuses will be hard-pressed to defend the indefensible. This effort will be difficult because public confidence in higher education has already plummeted to historic lows in the most recent polls."" Hanson also faults elite institutions for deviating from ""their ancient mission to teach students the ancient, disinterested, and inductive method of pursuing knowledge."" Looking toward possible resolutions to the current tension between institutions of higher education and the federal government, Hanson counsels, ""If universities were smart, they would accept federal conditions to follow the law and protect the safety and interests of their own students.""",HooverInstitution,2025-04-22T12:37:42,6

"Indeed. It's a badge of ideological honor to fight a federal gov't led by the ""fascist"" Donald Trump.   Anyone who believes money is more important than ideology to academia doesn't know what kind of animal they're dealing with.",Vessarionovich,2025-04-22T13:20:55,1

"It's just such a weird hill to die on. Even if you buy into their underlying thesis of academic freedom, making your stand by refusing to fix your anti-antisemitism problem is not a good look.  However, the Dems have a several hundred year history of vigorously, and oft violently, defending racism.",Kahnspiracy,2025-04-22T17:20:42,2
