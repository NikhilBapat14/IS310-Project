Just saying it would be much easier to deport people with due process if Republicans did not keep blocking funding to additional immigration Judges. Additionally putting them in prison in a foreign country makes that more difficult.,sedatedlife,2025-04-21T22:23:58,25

Does anyone know what the thought process or goal is for why this administration is targeting hispanic/latino immigrants?  Is it just that the hispanic/latino immigrant community is the biggest and they want to get rid of as many people as fast as possible? And by calling them gang members it might let them get away with skipping due process in the public eye?  Who does it benefit?,matt800,2025-04-21T22:31:23,4

"The cons are currently rallying around the “wife beating MS-13 member” as another sign that the dems keep backing culture war issues.    What I seem to notice is that they’ve seemingly just forgotten the law.   Up until the man is tried and convicted, he is innocent. Period. That is the one of the basic bedrock principles of this country.   It doesn’t matter how horrid of a person, how blatant the crime, or how badly the cops want to take them down, everyone is innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.   But then again can we really expect anything except vitriol and a profound rejection of basic American principles from these people?",lurkandnomore,2025-04-22T08:18:36,2

Right? Maybe institute some sort of amnesty for really low level cases if there are too many. Something like that. Maybe move towards immigration services focusing on helping new residents acclimate and follow the legal path the Republicans were so emphatic that they were ok with instead of destroying the tools for that path and dragging people off the street.,Opheliagonemad,2025-04-22T12:27:32,3

Yeah but it is interesting the groups they have chosen. At first glance hispanics/latinos are the largest undocumented immigrant group so they make sense to focus on for deportation. But Mexicans are by far the biggest group. So why are they focusing on El Salvador and Venezuela? They talk about gang crime but the gangs they are targeting are not large. They commit something like 1% of US gang crime. So seemingly there would be other reasons for why they are so focused on people from those countries and claiming it is about stopping gangs.,matt800,2025-04-21T23:15:10,6
"Yeah but the focus has specifically been on El Salvador and Venezuela. The 2 gangs they labeled as terror groups are not large. They commit something like 1% of US gang crime. So why them? My guess is the US has a deal with El Salvador to hold prisoners, so targeting El Salvadorians is easiest. Venezuelans might be second easiest because they have had so much bad press.   If the goal was just racism in the form of getting rid of immigrants the biggest group is Mexicans. But we haven't seen much propaganda against Mexicans.",matt800,2025-04-21T23:08:27,2

"There doesn't have to be a reason except chance or convenience though, as this is emotional rather than rational. They hate everyone who isn't them, so it doesn't really matter whom they target first as they will make themselves believe they were an imminent threat and particularly evil regardless of reality. The ""reason"" is simply invented to justify the emotion. They could have just picked them because they were easy to scapegoat and target at that particular time. Eventually, they will come for everyone, so it doesn't really matter in what order they do that.  And once they picked a target, they can't back down because they can't admit mistakes or wrongdoing.",barryvm,2025-04-22T01:04:43,5
