"Trump is destroying himself. He could have ridden the economic wave that Biden generated, but chose not to.",ranchoparksteve,2025-04-24T11:27:59,18
"A tumbling, tumbling dickweed",frankiestallone,2025-04-24T11:23:19,5
It will never drop below ~35%.  Ever.  That's how many of his psychotic followers exist in our country.,ERedfieldh,2025-04-24T11:29:15,9
45% approve is still way too high.,beatleface,2025-04-24T11:32:49,4
"The problem is can this trend last? This happened on his first term, and then eventually it got stable and people be like ""oh seems he is not doing anything crazy for now"" and then tick back up.",nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-04-24T11:52:38,2
"even when ""reporting"" bad news for dumbass, the Times pulls its punches; ""falling *steadily*"", really? Like a falling fucking knife, NYT, ffs",realancepts4real,2025-04-24T11:39:14,2

Trump looks like a bloated fish in this picture. Like one of those goldfish that somehow always got away.,letsgetregarded,2025-04-24T16:03:02,1
Trumps a dictator. Why should he care?,hobopopa,2025-04-24T16:48:16,1
"IT DOES NOT MATTER.  Election been and gone.  He sits in the seat of power and pulls all the levers of a compliant system.  The people who change their minds NOW are stupid. Anyone who did not see this all along is stupid.   They will change their minds again when the next propaganda wave hits.  And this is why a democracy over the long run is self defeating: Bc the vast majority of ppl are stupid and easily manipulated. Also, most ppl do not care for anything outside their personal sphere. This has been known and talked about since antiquity. Humans have not changed since then.",Alaishana,2025-04-24T17:41:52,1
Parading around polls of like 3000 people in an area of the pollsters choosing is pointless. The guy shouldn’t have 1 single supporter but these polls can be heavily influenced by who they choose to ask.,Ryanlester5789,2025-04-24T12:11:56,0
It’s a story when it dips below 35%.,TrailerParkFrench,2025-04-24T12:43:32,0
He said he was gonna “run it like a business”,Slibye,2025-04-24T19:18:53,1
"He doesn’t care about this at all. He’s already making 2028 hats. We don’t matter at all. Now with immunity and the destruction of the extant structure of government, all he cares about is power and money at any cost.",mcmonky,2025-04-24T22:40:47,1
"That was his floor the first term, but second term presidents have a lower floor. Beyond that, trump had the economy going well as a bolster to his popularity. It doesn’t seem like that will be the case this time around.",Disgruntled-Cacti,2025-04-24T11:58:29,3
"I'm almost inclined to agree, but I suspect only like 10% are on board with this shit, with the rest just ""not following politics too closely"" and coming from a family that ""has always been conservative"". Once the facts become impossible to ignore other than in the dark corners of the far right, republican support will crater. I hope, at least.",erocuda,2025-04-24T11:52:16,3
McCain was dragged down by Bush and Republicans who have to run in the midterms have to take a hard look at the numbers.  It also gives him less capital to get things done.,aslan_is_on_the_move,2025-04-24T11:55:23,3
Even then it isn’t a story. He won’t be removed.,BlondeBorednBaked,2025-04-24T12:56:15,1
"Trump is a Trojan horse.  He absolutely will be removed, but not by any official action.",Caraes_Naur,2025-04-24T13:19:08,2
