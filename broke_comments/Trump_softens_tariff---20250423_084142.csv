Tariffs are still in place and all we have is hearsay    People legit have the memory of goldfish,AssociateGreat2350,2025-04-23T08:47:15,77
">""The CEOs of three of the nation’s biggest retailers — Walmart, Target and Home Depot — privately warned him that his tariff and trade policy could disrupt supply chains, raise prices and empty shelves,”   >Said one administration official: “The big box CEOs flat out told him the prices aren’t going up, they’re steady right now, but they will go up. And this wasn’t about food. But he was told that shelves will be empty.”  >Another official said the CEOs told Trump disruptions could become noticeable in two weeks.",rapidcreek409,2025-04-23T08:45:13,21

"His words and tone are worthless. Tariffs are still in place, as expected no deals have been made, and fractures with former allies  growing by the day.",Sarcasmgasmizm,2025-04-23T08:52:07,16
"I doubt the threat of empty shelves was what caused this billionaire cabinet to reverse course. However, it’s easier to say that than “We made a stupid choice”.",gygbrown,2025-04-23T08:51:39,6
"Already happening in grocery stores here in LA. Average $2-$3 increase on all food items, haven't seen eggs in 3 weeks. My gardener said the farm his brother works on in Ventura had ICE show up and take 200 people and said the farmers were crying. He said its not just the picking crops, no one is there to plant the new ones. He said ""You wait and see"" Next year there wont be any food.",katiescasey,2025-04-23T10:43:27,6
"You all have to understand... I men HAVE to understand... that Trump never stops in his goals.  He retreats to calm you down and distracts, but he will return again.",TintedApostle,2025-04-23T09:16:59,4

Trump wanted to see who blinked first in this trade war. It was he who blinked first. China called his bluff and he looks like an idiot as usual.,grimace24,2025-04-23T09:46:50,4

Until his next rant over the weekend which will cause the market to drop again. Such a stable genius!,masstransience,2025-04-23T11:44:27,2
"He’s juicing the markets for his own profit margin. It’s insane to imagine he wouldn’t. He’s a *criminal*, released from all legal consequence. ",clickmagnet,2025-04-23T13:44:51,1
"Not only that, but if the tariffs go away, right under it is a food dye ban, which again will empty shelves for a time. Granted that’s their most understandable ban but is this cabinets goal to rob people of groceries and essentials.",gygbrown,2025-04-23T08:56:52,21

">Tariffs are still in place and all we have is hearsay  Yes, but much lower rate than Trump initially said/wanted. Trump is also quoted saying he is going to substantially lower the tariffs on China.",grimace24,2025-04-23T09:49:19,2

"Telling him it would happen ""in two weeks"" was a big mistake. For Trump, ""two weeks"" means ""never"".",def_indiff,2025-04-23T08:49:59,7
"The problem with that is China will just wait him out again, and pretty soon there will be empty shelves for Christmas.",rapidcreek409,2025-04-23T09:49:06,2
China had nine years to prepare for this scenario perpetrated by a bumbling moron without even a concept of a plan.   Meanwhile Trump stick in the past sits by the phone waiting for a call that isn’t coming.,ciopobbi,2025-04-23T10:20:05,2
He hasn’t folded yet as tariffs are still in place. Today he might say something completely different. How can businesses plan with such inconsistency?,TomatoesB4Potatoes,2025-04-23T09:29:42,4
That's not true. Canada has a food dye ban but there are natural dyes. Look at Canadian Footloops cereal vs. American Foodloop cereal and you'll see the food dyes Canada uses.,Throwawayiea,2025-04-23T09:02:54,8

"I just don't think anyone should trust what he says because he's been saying things like this a lot. Deals coming, tariffs dropping.   The last time it pumped the market. Which means the market is about vibes lately and not based on the economical data that is still very much in play",AssociateGreat2350,2025-04-23T09:51:02,5
I just hope it will happen just for what you've done to our world... Suffer American Suffer!,proypat,2025-04-23T11:56:04,0
Exactly there is no fold until it’s in the federal registar and even then he can change his mind at a whim,rawrisrawr,2025-04-23T10:06:44,1
True but I guarantee these food and beverage corporations are far more willing to bend a little for Canada’s administration than the US’s right now. They will argue and who can blame them?,gygbrown,2025-04-23T09:10:25,7
The US can't even get rid of the penny even though it costs more to make it than it's value. I think the bigger picture is that the US needs to regulate lobbyists and lobbying activities. These groups are who really run the USA Gov't. It's sad but it's true.,Throwawayiea,2025-04-23T09:33:48,2
