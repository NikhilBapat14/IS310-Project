>Biden created the CHNV program in 2023 via his executive parole authority.   So Trump can't stop an Executive order? Just because people have been told they can come in for 2 years doesn't mean they get to stay forever.,lets_shake_hands,2025-04-14T22:09:48,178
"So, the migrants can legally be given status by executive order (Biden), but it can’t be removed by executive order?  Fascinating. Asymmetry in executive power like this doesn’t seem to be particularly logical to me. Almost seems like this is just more pure partisanship from judges ( which is an oxymoron ).",jcr2022,2025-04-15T01:20:37,110

The courts are not allowed to do this. They have only seized this power recently. This is a violation of the separation of powers. If there is no congressional law blocking Trump from doing this then the courts have no power here.,kaytin911,2025-04-14T22:28:02,64
"500,000 migrants can be brought into America with the stroke of a pen, but they can't be remigrated with the stroke of a pen? That doesn't sound right. Seems like this judge is confused.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-14T22:44:00,28

Deport them anyway. Fuck these judges who don't have to live with the consequences of these shitty rulings.,Fact_Stater,2025-04-14T23:40:14,5
"""help reduce illegal crossings at the southern border and allow better vetting of people entering the country""  Bullshit, theres been plenty of reporting, theres no checks on the system at all to prevent lying, and the app can be filled out in literally under a minute and instantly give access to the US. All of these people are illegal immigrants, deport them, no further discussion needed.",ultrainstict,2025-04-14T22:34:26,3

>i believe biden vastly exceeded his parole authority  I don't think Dementia Biden had the braincells to comprehend even  what authority he had.  It was probably his chief of staff with the auto-pen signing these EO's.,GiediOne,2025-04-15T07:05:16,8
