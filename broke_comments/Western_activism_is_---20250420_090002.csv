It doesn’t need to make sense as long as the protests pay,Xander_hades_,2025-04-20T17:10:00,140
They still haven't topped the LGBT rainbow burkas that were all the fashion at protests in the UK some years ago.,ChristopherRoberto,2025-04-21T00:55:52,30
"At this point it's all either just one big psy-op or like a Nigerian Prince banking scam.  Anyone who still stands behind this crap either has zero brains or zero moral fiber.  Either way, you know a lot about the people when they virtue signal.  They are only recruting either very stupid or very naive people, which works out for them because they don't want any big brains asking questions.  Scams fall apart when even slightly intelligent people start asking questions.  Can't have that, enter virtue signaling half-wits championing people who would execute them.",Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-04-20T15:57:36,90

That’s not “western” activism.  That’s leftist activism.,Narrow-Trash-8839,2025-04-21T16:09:39,4
The Coalition of the Disaffected might want to pass on this particular disaffected entanglement. It won't end well. Please study Shari'a Law and get back to me ...,Schwanntacular,2025-04-20T22:26:46,3

"Yeah, I don't buy it either.  Of course, I was always amazed seeing young women at the Free Palestine tent encampments.  Do they have any idea how women are treated under sharia law?",LK_Feral,2025-04-20T16:01:42,121
"It's real, but the censorship is also real, and it doesn't let me post links.  It's annoying. The photos are right here, on my phone - I live in Boston - but I can't get them to you! They really do fly the same banners, side by side.",Right_Archivist,2025-04-21T05:39:20,15

Yeah I know. I constantly check my profile because of the damn keyword filters. Thanks Reveddit.  I just looked up the phrase and found a ton of videos on Twitter. These people are certifiable. If someone told me circa 2015 that this was end-stage leftism disease I wouldn’t have believed it.,zip117,2025-04-21T06:09:16,10
