Never heard of it even from my grandparents who were born around 1900.,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-22T17:44:28,24
A potato is more expensive than an egg. Don’t tell lefties though. ,Reuters-no-bias-lol,2025-04-24T03:28:51,2
"\#1 cheap starch, kept me going when I was dirt poor.  Dyes were expensive before synthetics became the norm, likewise people were far poorer than today.  Playing with lots of dyes for giggles and then forgetting about it the next day is a modern invention. The left hoaxed again when they pretended they had the true ancient traditions of messing with dyes.  Last but not least, anyone lurking here who is still holding onto the idea of coloring potatoes *can just go freaking try it.* They might stain a little, but their existing deep coloration means they don't make a good canvas and the dyes aren't great at sticking to things on their own with nothing to bind them. Maybe if it were boiled in salty dye for a while it might stick, so time and power can be wasted on top of food and dye. Salt was also expensive in the past (and dyes typically counted on it to work.)",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-22T23:46:42,5
That’s probably because it doesn’t happen.,dottedoctet,2025-04-22T18:05:21,21
