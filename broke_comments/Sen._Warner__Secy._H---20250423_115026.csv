"If he had an ounce of self awareness, he wouldn't have taken the job in the first place because he is woefully unqualified.  He'll never step down unless Trumps orders it.  They could film him lying in a ditch with a liquor bottle and the Signal app open while sending classified information to Putin and it would be excused.",Accurate-Guava-3337,2025-04-23T11:59:50,11
Whiskey Pete is a trainwreck from a leadership and security point of view.  He is at best incompetent and at worst drunkenly and dangerously arrogant and reckless.  He needs to be fired and charged with the crimes he committed.,MrPantsyFlants,2025-04-23T11:56:14,11

"Neither will happen because the current leader of the Senate would rather work with the GOP when it comes time to take action for the average American.  Mark Warner is the richest Democrat in the Congress, he doesn’t really care what’s at stake if he can’t give tangible actions that he is taking to build public pressure against the losers in office. And no, cable news appearances talking to the same group of people all the time does not count. ",wdymxoxo69420,2025-04-23T11:53:29,3

If I had been in his place I would have turned it down. I’m not qualified for that position and I know  it. It’s not  learn on the job type of position.,Outrageous-Pause6317,2025-04-23T16:13:12,1

"About 750,000 people watch the Situation Room.  So in this one interview Warner has spoken to 3 times more people than all of millionaire Sanders' rallies combined.  Informing the public is an important part of building pressure against the administration.",aslan_is_on_the_move,2025-04-23T12:48:05,1

"It’s still just the cable news audience. The rest of the country has moved on to new media, as evidenced by Dem’s increasing voter share of the elderly.  Outreach is important, Dem’s don’t do it in meaningful ways to get new voters  who can stomach checking a box next to a D. People don’t want to return to the old Democratic Party, but when they do out of disgust for Trump and see nothing has changed, we’ll have a hard time winning in 28.",wdymxoxo69420,2025-04-23T12:56:00,0
