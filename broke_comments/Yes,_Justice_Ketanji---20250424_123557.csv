Just send your kids to another school? Um... that's a problem if every public school teaches this shit.  Not everyone can afford private school and it's a ridiculous alternative when the parents already pay for public school. Why is it so hard to just teach basic skills without political indoctrination?,purplebasterd,2025-04-24T13:14:21,117
It’s funny how Leftists fight tooth and nail against school choice but then use it to explain why it’s okay for public school to be trash.  “Oh you don’t like us brainwashing your kids with our political and sexual ideology? Spend your own money and time to pursue a private education that we intend to take away from you if we ever get the chance.”,MrJohnMosesBrowning,2025-04-24T13:00:03,122
KETANJI BROWN JACKSON: “I’m struggling to see how it burdens a parent’s religious exercise if the school teaches something the parent disagrees with. You have a choice. You don’t have to send your kid to that school.”  .  How did she ever become a SCJ?  One of life's greatest mysteries.,Ironman650,2025-04-24T13:23:27,110
"Most commentators and observers are, understandably, standing slack jawed at Brown-Jackson's apparent belief that teaching objectively false political propaganda (that a kid can change his/her gender just by wishing it so and playing dress-up) is the public school's prerogative.  It is difficult to take her seriously as she is a woman but can’t define what a woman is. Yet she sits on the USSC!    What insanity!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-24T12:56:23,64
All I took from this is Jackson is pro-school choice.  She unequivocally wants voucher programs.,jimmy4889,2025-04-24T14:47:02,17
So why does this argument not apply to the Ten Commandments in classrooms? And she really just destroyed the leftist argument against school choice/voucher programs that are becoming popular around the country.  Also easy to argue LGBQI is basically its own religion at this point. What happened to the Leftist idea that no mention of God or faith can be in the classroom?,slagathor_zimblebob,2025-04-24T14:39:55,21

"This is what DEI gets you, Morons with the megamind syndrome!   All the liberal justices make idiotic arguments most the time, But at least the other two have the intelligence to pass themselves off as real jurists sometimes!

"paul ryan supported her confirmation for judgeship under obama and SCOTUS under biden because she was family. im sure KBJ gave plenty of speeches supporting Ryan for VP in 2012. I mean, she probably voted for the Romney/ Ryan ticket in 2012 right?",CalmHabit3,2025-04-24T13:53:49,9
That thing is a SCJ.  It probably couldn't even take my food order correctly.  Straight up dumb ass.,BohdiOfValhalla,2025-04-24T13:23:53,11

"Of all the liberal-appointed SCJs, KBJ usually is the one with the best dissenting positions. She usually presents a reasonably compelling literalist/textualist argument for why she disagress with the more conservative SCJs (versus Soto who entirely makes her jugements based on feelings of how she would prefer the world to work). KBJ's positon here is really  bizarre given her usual perspective.",deciduousredcoat,2025-04-24T14:10:36,-4

Beggars can’t be choosers. It has been a long standing conservative viewpoint to have school choice. Glad the left is finally seeing it. If you can’t afford private you should homeschool or find a pod that meets your needs.,FlimsyInitiative2951,2025-04-24T17:48:13,-11
