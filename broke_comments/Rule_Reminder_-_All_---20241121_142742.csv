"you should define what a ""top level comment"" is.  After reading your rules, I wasted an hour writing a comment recently only to have a bot delete it.  I'm reading this post and now understand what you mean but I promise there are a lot of other people who will never see it and also just think, ""wow, ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/Ask\_Politics/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/) I did the thing) is kind of an abusive and exclusionary place that I don't want to interact with anymore.""  Given that Reddit is being pushed out to a lot of content aggregation services you'll find many more people are coming in and not knowing the lingo but having potentially valuable insight to provide.",ricksanchez__,2024-11-23T08:41:46,4
Virtually none of the top level postings are sourced. Comments should not require anymore sourcing than the original posting. You should better define the term sourcing. Iâ€™m about ready quite this app.,redrawman,2024-12-19T11:54:32,2
"Hello I am unsure as to why my Submission continues to be automatically removed, here it is:  Title: **In a Fixed-Term Parliament, should there be time-limits for dissolution?**     Assume the parliament works on **a fixed-term election basis every 3 years,** meaning that **calling new elections does not reset the election cycle.** With that in mind:   1. Should there be time limits for dissolution be it: Discretionary (PM Calls early Elections), Double Dissolution, or Regular Vote of No Confidence?     1. By Time-Limits I mean, rules like ""A motion for dissolution of Parliament cannot be called within 100 days of the fixed-term election"". 2. How long does it typically take for new governments to take office from the time of dissolution? Does it vary wildly? What is the typical range?  Thank you all",Samborondon593,2024-12-05T16:23:18,1
"I just looked at the comment that was removed and if that took you an hour... wow.  Top-level comments are the first replies to a question posted here.  That's a standard term across of reddit, so much so that the auto-moderator functions have specific rules for it.  >Given that Reddit is being pushed out to a lot of content aggregation services you'll find many more people are coming in and not knowing the lingo but having potentially valuable insight to provide.  If they can't be bothered to read the rules, they're not going to give the types of answers we look for here.",AuditorTux,2024-11-23T16:15:11,1

"Where the heck are you pulling that from?  Because on the sidebar, you can see:  >3. Top-tier comments should be good-faith, fact-based efforts to answer questions. **In almost all situations, you should cite at least one reputable source for top-level comments.**  And in the expanded guidelines in the link on the sidebar, its not an absolute requirement but the exception is:  >at first if the comment is sufficiently comprehensive  There might be some other space that hasn't been updated, but its pretty clear.",AuditorTux,2025-02-20T20:37:54,1
