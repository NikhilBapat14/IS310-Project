"So Trump can tell the UK what to do, but can't tell El Salvador to release one guy?",clquake,2025-04-17T08:10:15,143
"Yes, Idiot Trump thinks he can tell other countries what they can do. the world needs to make it clear that Idiot Trump is pulling us out of the ""Family of Nations"" and aligning us with horrendous dictatorial regimes that thrive on human rights violations.  Just as our foreign policy has supported regime change from within a country rather than external military force, our allies need to remind us what an aberration on the world stage this moron is.",YallerDawg,2025-04-17T06:43:24,88

"From an American - let the Trump deal lapse. Screw him and his racist, homophobic, asshat billionaire friends.  You can find better goods, cheaper, in Europe.   When America has regained her senses, then we can talk about a new deal, if there are any partners left in the world who would want to trade with us at that point.",Ayste,2025-04-17T08:04:19,65
"There it is. Saw an article last week that the EU still didn't know what Trump wanted, because they already offered 0% tarriff and nobody bit.   Of course this is what he wants - first and foremost - you gotta be willing to hurt the right people. üòî",yebyen,2025-04-17T07:07:58,62

"What do you mean ""another Republican president"" - the Republican party is fading extremely fast and is likely going to have to rebuild from the ground up. No one trusts them anymore but the die-hard loyalists.  The Democratic party is setup nicely for probably the next 20 years if Trump keeps on doing what he is doing.

"As an American, I think we should be rejected for these expectations. One of the tipping points that plunged the American right into what it is today is the deregulation of protections for marginalized people. Bigots will always exist, but emboldening them gives them power. Take away their freedom to commit hate crimes against people and they no longer hold any power. Free speech is not absolute.

"No one, and I mean no one, is waiting around on the freaking Republicans to do anything. They have shown their colors and they are red and gold with orange accents.  I will throw my lot in with Democrats who are trying to do something at the state levels, all across the country.  The Democrats in DC need to be overhauled, people like AOC and Crockett needs to be pushed to the front.   Honestly, eff all the Republicans. They are complacent and collaborators of this regime.",Ayste,2025-04-17T13:36:06,6
