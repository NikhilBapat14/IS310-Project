You mean he wasn't satisfied with just the Sudetenland?,putin_my_ass,2025-04-22T10:04:34,3
I read that as “insufferable” while scrolling and it still made sense obviously.,Stranger1982,2025-04-22T09:41:06,7

The answer is simple:  Trump's goal (like some several of his other business ventures) is to drive the country into bankruptcy.  He thinks he'll then be able so settle the US debts in some court for pennies on the dollar and we all live happily ever after.,ArcOfADream,2025-04-22T18:54:31,1

"maybe try reading the actual piece instead of ranting about the headline, I shared it so there's no excuse not to read it. there's no confusion at all.  here, I'll give you the beginning since clicking it seems so difficult:  >As President Trump’s assault on America’s civic institutions approaches its 100th day, the question is whether those charged with maintaining the integrity of Congress, the law, the courts, the media, academia and the civil service recognize the seriousness of the threat they face.  >With the exception of Harvard, three law firms and a small set of federal judges, the track record so far does not inspire confidence.  >A crucial tactic adopted by Trump in his second term is to isolate a target. Justin Gest, a professor of public policy at George Mason University, elaborated on that point in an email:  >Trump’s key method is to, one by one, eliminate as many independent institutions as possible that are free enough to resist or criticize him.  >In the private sector, Trump has cowed otherwise independent companies by threatening them with arbitrary penalties. Rather than collectively resist Trump’s extortive tactics, companies from law firms to tech giants have sold out the long-term stability of a democratically governed free market to protect their earnings in the short term.  >This collective action problem extends to universities, which are independent from government control but rely on governments for research funds, tax-exempt status, and the admission of international students and scholars.  >In each case, the president isolates key targets and threatens them, and seemingly them only, if they don’t bend to his will. And for each target, the calculation is simple: Resisting entails concentrated costs to their organization and diffuse public benefits to American democracy, whereas capitulating transfers diffuse costs to American democracy and concentrated benefits to their organization.   does that sound 'confusing' to you? the author is clear that trump is an authoritarian threat to our country and congress isn't doing it's job to prevent it.",corrector300,2025-04-22T10:50:13,3
"The article clearly is not talking about ambition or a dedication toward what a leader might see as progress but rather Trump’s moving goal posts. Even after companies, universities, and some countries have vowed to him and agreed to the administration’s requests it is never enough and trump has come back each time wanting something more. Most presidents have upheld their word and let agreements stand, hence why they have not been called “insatiable”.",Ok-Carpenter2983,2025-04-22T09:54:37,3
