Imagine thinking you can’t write a strong female character without it being political,snookyface90210,2025-04-13T15:19:24,73
Disney appears to enjoy losing money over political posturing and virtue signaling.,RandolphE6,2025-04-13T22:10:11,17

I mean the movie has Pedro Pascal in it. A man version of Brie Larson. Not looking forward to the movie at all.   Imagine how many more amazing superhero movies we could have had if it wasn’t for women activists. ,Reuters-no-bias-lol,2025-04-13T17:31:36,28

There's a wide gulf between not being a doormat and being a mindless vehicle for leftist politics.  John Byrne's run in the 80s showed how to actually further empower a character like Sue Storm.  He did great things with Sue.        But Marvel Studios would never go to the actual comics when they can just hire some activist hack who probably knows nothing about the history of the FF (and might even be contemptuous of it) to butcher their IP more in order to appeal to an audience that hardly exists.,ConceptJunkie,2025-04-13T19:58:41,4
"This isn't political.  Sue Storm *was* a doormat in previous iterations.  Each of their powers is loosely based on personality traits - and Sue becomes invisible *because she felt invisible.*  So yeah, I'm cool with making Sue Storm a more modern character.",LatinNameHere,2025-04-14T07:46:21,-3
Womp womp.  Marvel once again letting F4 drop like a bowling ball in a swimming pool.,squunkyumas,2025-04-14T05:33:51,0
"And yet they then write the most annoying and despised woman character to prove their point.   I wish movies would go back to being entertaining regardless of who the lead is, instead of garbage that nobody wants to see. ",Reuters-no-bias-lol,2025-04-13T17:33:35,27
"IMO the Fallout TV show did this extremely well. The female lead is definitely what I would call a strong character, even though she gets beat up physically, mentally, and morally.",Alpha-Sierra-Charlie,2025-04-14T06:34:49,5

"> I mean the movie has Pedro Pascal in it. A man version of Brie Larson.  What?  Pedro Pascal is extremely well liked, charismatic on screen, and not comparable to Brie Larson in any way shape or form.  He was incredible in Narcos.  He steals the movie - from Nicolas Cage - in Incredible Weight of Massive Talent.   His character in Game of Thrones was a fan-favorite.  He gets raves for his portrayal of Joel in Last of US.  Lets not be so ready to jump on the woke-broke bandwagon that we  start disparaging people who have done nothing to earn that.",LatinNameHere,2025-04-14T07:49:05,3
"I won't even consider it until hearing reviews from people I trust.  If it turns out to be good (and I hope it is, against odds), I'll probably just buy it on Blu-Ray.   I've been waiting for someone to actually capture the spirit of the FF in cinema.  The early 2000s movies weren't awful, but they sure weren't great.  I never saw Fanfourstic because it looked awful.          So far, the only person to do it with any authenticity was Roger Corman, and he was working on a shoestring budget.",ConceptJunkie,2025-04-13T20:02:10,1
I'm sick of the bad superhero movie trend.  I'd happily go back to more of what they were making in Phase 1 through 3.,ConceptJunkie,2025-04-13T20:00:23,9
He earned it 10 fold. And he is not a good actor either. ,Reuters-no-bias-lol,2025-04-14T11:08:38,2
"Even if it does turn out to be decent, I probably wouldn’t even stream it. I wasn’t very interested in this movie to begin with, and shoehorning gender politics bs into it killed whatever interest I had in seeing it.",Wolf687,2025-04-13T21:52:01,-2
