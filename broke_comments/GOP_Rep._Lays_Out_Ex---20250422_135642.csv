">House Republicans are trying to drastically cut Medicaid coverage and blame it all on the states.  >When Democrats expanded Medicaid coverage under President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act to include adults with incomes of up to 138 percent of the poverty level, states that implemented the expansion received a 90 percent federal medical assistance percentage, or FMAP, from the federal government. That means the federal government covers 90 percent of the costs for those enrolled in the ACA expansion, and the state covers 10 percent.  >The GOP wants to drastically decrease the federal match rate for the ACA expansion and shift more financial responsibility to states, Republican Representative Austin Scott told Fox Business Tuesday.  >“What we have talked about is moving that 90 percent level of the expansion back towards the more traditional levels of 50 to approximately 80 percent instead of the 90/10,” Scott said.",thenewrepublic,2025-04-22T13:57:15,15

So how are big pharma and insurance companies not classified as terrorist organizations at this point?   In what way is ok to bank roll polticians to make life saving care as expensive as humanly possible while knowing that they are going to kill hundreds of thousands of people every year with these policy changes just so the world's richest of the richest oligarchs can get even more rich?  All of this is just objectively unnecessary. All so people who will never be able to spend all their money currently can have even more money?  Stuff like this really makes it hard to believe there's a God.,Minute-Individual-74,2025-04-22T20:36:51,1
