"My response doesn't cover every issue that the right and left argue about, but there are a number of issues that conservatives simply have a simple answer to which they can easily coalesce around. Being conservative inherently means you would like to conserve the status quo or possibly revert back to a known quantity.   So if you take health care, for example, conservatives simply have to say they don't want anything to change and come together on that. On the progressive side, they might all agree that the current situation isn't good, but that's about all they'll agree on. Once you get to the point of actually coming up with a plan, you'll find that some progressives want a single payer system, some want insurance company regulation change, and some want something else entirely. So it's hard to agree on exactly what progress you want to make, but it's easy to simply say ""no"" to proposed changes.   In my opinion, that's why it appears that the left is all over the place and the right is lock step together in everything.",Head_Nerd_In_Charge,2025-04-09T17:42:58,76
"My view is that right wing ideals offer simple solutions to complex problems. Leftist views are often more nuanced and are a bigger societal lift.

Senate Republicans have literally said to reporters that they fear for their lives over Trump‘s unhinged minions. That’s why they don’t dare break with him.  Because republicans severely punish disloyalty.   It’s also why Republicans have idiotic policies.

"No. Recency bias has made people forget that there have been many times in the last two decades where the narrative was ""Democrats are united. Why can't the Republicans have party discipline like the dems do?""   Genuinely as early as the last midterms, where the GOP got crushed after expecting a red wave, this question was being asked.    What it comes down to is that parties want to win, and so they will rally around whoever they think has the best chance of winning. When their champion falls the party goes into disarray for awhile while trying to figure out what the new strategy is.    The GOP has gone all-in on MAGA as a winning ticket. Neoliberalism has failed the Dems twice in 3 elections so now they're trying to figure out whether to keep the strategy or try something else.

"Right-wing ideology is more authoritarian, meaning they force the lower rungs to obey the top rungs, and they do it by telling the lower rungs that they will have more control over their lives if they obey. Essentially a pyramid scheme of ‘do as I say and you will be rewarded’.   This isn’t always the case though, usually the lower rungs just get screwed over because the top rungs didn’t really care about them.

"> Could it be related to psychological traits, such as a stronger focus on loyalty, tradition, and group identity? Or is it more about the moral foundations that conservatives tend to emphasize, like loyalty and authority? Perhaps it’s about how left-wing movements often involve a broader range of causes, which might make coalition-building more challenging?  It's none of these.  The infighting usually happens before the final product on the right, while the left prefers to air theirs out as part of the formulation period.  It's just a style situation at the moment, and one that would have looked completely different 15 years ago when the left was firmly behind the Obama administration and the right couldn't coalesce.  > I also notice a lot of left-wing infighting, which could be contributing to this dynamic. I'm curious what others think. Why do you think one side seems to unite more easily than the other?  I'd argue that the right has needed to compromise with itself for decades because of so many competing interests that are actually in opposition to each other, and it's the left that tends to fall in line seeing as the disagreements tend to be more on the degree of change rather than the foundation.",ClockOfTheLongNow,2025-04-09T16:45:09,6

"It's something psychological, yes. I used to identify as a socialist, and because of personal circumstances, I've oftentimes been invited to overwhelmingly left-wing spaces.  There's no side-stepping the obvious problem that -western- left-wing communities are full of severe dysfunction, backstabbing, and melodrama. I don't even see a lot of people on the left deny this, they just begrudgingly accept it and ask ""well, what am I supposed to do, abandon my beliefs just because the people around me are annoying and bad friends and can't do optics?""  And honestly, at some point, it may be worth updating the priors. I think there is a through line that has to be acknowledged. At the very minimum, it means that the people on your side are not able to effectively organize to turn your ideas into policy and you have to go back to square one.  There's really no equivalency that can be made on the right, because right-wing infighting happens at a higher level and is primarily about politics. The kind of unrelated infighting that happens in left-wing communities is literally unbelievable to people who aren't involved in them. There's struggle sessions on niche issues nobody's even heard of before.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-09T23:09:15,2
"The answer is pretty straightforward:  Republicans tend to want *less* federal government intervention and programs, and more governance deferred to the states.  Everyone agrees.  The Democrats want redistribution which means alignment on (a) who to take it from and (b) who to give it to.  That’s a problem because only thing people can truly agree on is “tax people who make more then me, nor me” and “give it to me or my community”.  So when the democratic base is hugely varied identities and income levels, they just can’t agree on either of those things.  All they can agree on is that the billionaires are bad. Which is perfectly true enough from a fairness perspective, but billionaire level tax isn’t enough to pay for what they want, it won’t even close the deficit.   The Democrats could credibly roll back Bush and Trump era tax cuts which would cover maybe half the deficit while risking it slowing economic growth / jobs, but it wouldn’t pay for net new stuff. Which is basically high risk / low reward for them - so they don’t.",Kman17,2025-04-09T18:53:20,2
"They conform to a group standard that makes them more similar. The more similar people are, the more uniform they are, literally. While that uniformity means they lack adaptability and can't handle change as well, their greater similarity means a stronger extent of unity. They can succeed at fewer situations than the diverse, but they succeed to a greater extent when they do because they all think, feel and act the same, so it makes a more efficient system.  The left values diversity, which makes unity more difficult and creates a limit of unity. They can only unite to the extent they are similar and can agree. Diversity can succeed in a wider range of situations, but succeed to a lesser extent in any given situation because they don't all think, feel and act the same, so it makes a less efficient system.  Diversity is strongest when things are dynamic and complex, uniformity is strongest when things are static and simple. The right doesn't need to account for everyone's unique perspectives, thoughts, feelings and values. That is genuinely costly for a society to do, being inclusive. The right doesn't carry that cost because there is far less diversity of perspectives, thoughts, feelings and values.",news_feed_me,2025-04-10T01:10:25,1

"Ultimately, and very generally, the right wing actually wants to win elections and succeed in their goals.   The left wing seems unable to see past their nose, and so instead of doing things that might actually win them elections and achieve their goals, they engage in purity tests and circular firing squads. It seems like the left wing, especially the more vocal aspects of it, are more interested in feeling good about themselves than actually getting things done. Lots of virtue signaling, etc, with no real substance to their actions. Ironically, much of what these people do actually harms their goals and alienates potential allies, more than it helps their goals and attracts new allies.  The right wing's goals are generally easier to achieve, and often amounts to eliminating things, destroying things, dismantling things, etc. It's much easier to dismantle than it is to build.   The left wing's goals require structure and nuance, which the left wing is simply unable to unite around.   The most vocal aspects of both wings want to see the world as a black and white place, with no room for nuance. While this sometimes does, and sometimes does not, work to the benefit of the right wing, it almost always works to the detriment of the left wing.   Republicans would be happy with a 5% tax cut, and even happier with a 10% tax cut.   Meanwhile, the Democrats might propose a 5% tax increase (to, say, fund social services), but the hard leftists (that may not even vote in the next election, anyways) will claim that 5% isn't enough, and that the mainstream Democrats are fascists for not proposing a 20% tax increase.

"There’s actually some history behind how this divide started, at least in the US. A guy named Richard T. Ely in the late 1800s had this idea that you could combine Christian good Samaritan values with government. Instead of hoping people helped the poor, why not just mandate it? Use taxes, laws, and policy to make people be good. That mindset kicked off a shift in American politics where “compassion” got tied to state power, and that’s pretty much the root of modern progressivism.  Psychologically, the left builds everything around empathy. That sounds good on paper, but the issue is that they’ve moralized their empathy to the point that any disagreement looks like cruelty. They’ve framed every issue through a narrow emotional lens. Everything becomes life or death, oppressed or oppressor, ally or enemy. That doesn’t leave room for nuance. And when that empathy is weaponized, it justifies things like censorship or violence because they’re “protecting” people. But if your empathy only works when people agree with you, it’s not really empathy, it’s control.  The right looks at things differently. We value freedom, even if that means people fail. That gets us painted as heartless, but it’s not that we don’t care, we just think helping someone means giving them tools, a hand up, not a handout. We also don’t expect everyone on our side to think exactly the same. We can argue about policy, religion, economics, and still respect each other. So, it might look like we’re more unified, but really, we’re just more comfortable with disagreement. We don't have to kick people out of the tribe for not towing a line. We value disagreement and open dialogue.   So when you ask if there’s something more inherent to right-wing ideology that resists infighting, I’d say yeah, because we never assumed everyone had to be the same in the first place.

You can be firm in your conviction that there should be no compromise on human rights and democracy, without believing human rights and democracy are ""objectively"" moral.  You can be firm in that conviction simply because autocracy has more bad outcomes for more morally interested subjects and because you are empathetic to oppressed people.   The essence of democracy and self-governance is moral relativism. Jesus himself coined the golden rule, which is the nucleus of moral relativism.

These two categories could be argued over because all elements are not always there for either. For instance, socialism and communalism and proletarianism generally aren’t practiced by democratic politicians today, but that is because the party is closer to centrism than L-wI’s.   You can have authority and not practice authoritarianism. 1.

"It sounds like hair-splitting to distinguish between authoritarianism and authoritative. I’m not really seeing a difference.   Throughout many administrations we have seen executive agencies push policies disguised as laws, complete with arbitrary penalties and none of this went through the democratic process beyond the initial creation of these agencies by Congress. Congress just creates an agency and denies any responsibility after that. Department of Ed., ATF, EPA, DHS, etc. just arbitrarily make rules and penalties for many, many things. This is not democratic and the blame belongs with both parties. SCOTUS kind of put a damper on that last year, I think, but who knows how that will eventually play out.   I know Biden and Trump have both signed numerous executive orders, but it certainly didn’t begin with them. I’m really pressed for time lately, so I can’t compile lists. My opinion is that Congress created much of this by essentially writing the current president (whoever that might be) a mostly blank check by creating executive agencies and then saying, “Go and do whatever you need to do in order to complete your mission.”  Well, the mission could potentially be redefined with each administration if adequate controls were not put in place originally.",thegarymarshall,2025-04-14T14:59:45,1

"I looked up a Reddit eli5 about liberalism vs neoliberalism, and it said neoliberalism was supported by Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, so calling it left-wing seems odd to me in that context. I saw elements of it being left-wing, like denying someone the right to not sell their cake to someone they don’t want to, but it very much otherwise seemed sort of right-wing with opening up markets (tho I don’t necessarily see that as right-wing). Liberalism, or classical liberalism also had elements both favored by both wings.   So I can agree that multiple isms can and have been used by both parties (Trump for instance used populist sentiments to grow his base without fully holding any position after in office). In light of that I took to Wikipedia, and I’d ask if we continue this conversation we both read this wiki page’s https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left–right_political_spectrum top portion, contemporary terminology, and criticism sections (I read them and thought they’d be useful enough).   I think with that as a grounding for left vs right wing we can then further keep discussing.

"I would say it’s not hair-splitting, but I could understand why you feel that way.   Authority can give reasons (and evidence) for suggestions/orders. Authority is aware of the power differentials between the expert and layperson and makes every reasonable effort to eliminate or minimise them. Authoritarianism means hiding behind the cloak of ‘respectability’ and hierarchy, wanting blind obedience; government by technocrats, dismissing dissent as ignorance. Some of the obvious smear words used by authoritarians against opponents they don’t want to engage with are: luddites, anti-progress, “selfish Westerners.”  There is a difference if you look into the meaning of each. Language is complex, and it’s only gotten more complex with the advent of written history.   The agencies you speak of were created to deal with matters that require experts to use their authority in said fields to make sure laypeople aren’t trampled over, versus congress needing to be experts in all areas and make specific rules. A good example is RFK Jr. spreading propaganda about autism and safety in regard to vaccines. He is using the Trump administrations authority to promote skepticism in sound science, thus turning it authoritarian. A healthy agency uses their expertise and labor to produce reasonable policy in better ways than congress could.   We have seen experts in their own fields become complete fools when assigned to agencies they had no right to run, Ben Carson being a good example. Brilliant surgeon by all standards I’ve heard of, but terrible pick for HUD (housing and urban development) (see wiki for more info, it has a good section).   I guess from what I’m reading you want congress people like Majorie Taylor Greene directly leading agencies, rather than nominating experts to lead said agencies?

"…Anthony Fauci, Alejandro Mayorkas, Pete Buttigieg…yeah, I understand.   This is an inherent problem and I’m not sure what to do about. Political appointees tend to become political, or at least influenced by political entities. Maybe Congress needs to find a happy medium. They could narrowly likit the scopes for these agencies.   You and I might disagree about things like bump stocks, barrel length and other firearm rules, but do we want an individual who is appointed to lead the ATF (or any other agency) to just make (or remove) rules that carry the weight of laws, complete with penalties without Congress weighing in?  I understand that Congress doesn’t have time to vote over every minute detail, but any new burden placed on the people should at least have some kind of vote by those who have been elected.  These changes could be submitted for a simple yea or nay vote at the very least, especially where penalties are involved.   Sound science is not truth. I am a firm believer in the scientific method, but brilliant scientists frequently disagree. Science is also constantly changing its mind, which is one of its strengths. Science should be considered when making public policy, but it’s not a monolith and shouldn’t be viewed that way, even when a majority of scientists in a particular field agree on a particular theory because it is still a theory. How many times during COVID did the science change during both administrations?  Some policy makers were getting whiplash from making direction changes so often. Others locked onto the first thing they heard and refused to change course. In these situations, it might be best to publish information as quickly as it becomes available and then let individuals make their own decisions.   Government agencies are not nimble. Once they collect what they believe to be the facts, they are very reactionary until they decide on new rules. Then it can be nearly impossible to get them to change course. They have either moved on to other things or they don’t want to be seen as indecisive, so we end up with rules that were created in a knee-jerk response to something that made headlines.   I don’t want individual congress members to run executive agencies.

"Well, from wiki on authoritarianism: Authoritarianism is a political system characterized by the rejection of political plurality, the use of strong central power to preserve the political status quo, and reductions in democracy, separation of powers, civil liberties, and the rule of law.[1][2] Authoritarian regimes may be either autocratic or oligarchic and may be based upon the rule of a party or the military.  Any L-wI can be implemented since L-wIs aren’t to reject political plurality, they aren’t stifling democracy, they respect the separation of powers, civil liberties, and the rule of law. L-wIs gain their power from the legitimacy of their votes through honest discussion rather than lies, fear, hatred, and overall not pushing authoritarianism. A state that has willful participation doesn’t require force to get its way.   I’m not an avid historian, but the USSR decided to put loyalty to a single-state party rather than a plurality of parties or factions. You were either for the party or you were working against the party. The call to authoritarianism to get your way is easy, but educating the masses that will then willfully and actively push back against such calls is always an important policy.   We have right-leaning politicians dismantling the department of education, putting in incompetent leadership to facilitate that dismantling, cancelling lead pipe removal in WI schools bc they fired all the staff that would help with that at the HHS which hurts all generations of youth, FL and TX re-writing history textbooks to call slavery “not so bad”, the Trump administration re-writing history by calling everything they don’t like DEI and hiding or removing it, etc.   L-w parties can descend into authoritarianism, but we’ve generally seen R-w parties glorify in it time and again, we’re in fact seeing it now, so maybe consider laying criticisms on all parties when they do it and not giving our favored parties leeway to commit such atrocities as authoritarianism.

"Do you think that instead of appointed bureaucrats for agency positions, elected bureaucrats would do better? EBs for short. Though tbf appointed bureaucrats are already chosen by the current administration and voted on by the senate, so they sort of are EBs. So to make them more electable, EBs would have to be voted on by citizens, maybe 3-4 weeks after the presidential election, and 3-4 weeks after any agency head drops out during an administration.   If EBs were to happen I’d say that the president chooses 1, the agency in question can put up 1 internal name, and outsiders can apply by getting a 20 senators or 90 house members to vouch for them (with limits to 2 per chamber). No real election season, the EBs get their info put up in a central location/website for people to view and comment/complain. Any EBs tied to lobbyists should have their clear loyalties displayed rather than hidden, and any uncovered subterfuge should disqualify them or get them fired.   As for limits to agencies, would you then be okay with more smaller agencies with specific goals? Would you be upset if bureaucracy grew to accommodate more agencies? What do you say to the fact that agency policy making already has judicial and congressional review?  I feel like your take on science is mainly correct but also a bit off. Saying that scientists frequently disagree without saying what they disagree on isn’t a claim on anything. Scientists could disagree on what’s for breakfast, or they could disagree on E=mc^(2), and without clarifying it’s just obfuscating what you’re trying to tell me. There are many different fields of science, so when a quantum physicist disagrees with a paleontologist on the paleontologist’s findings the quantum physicist is out of their knowledge comfort zone. Same with a quantum physicist disagreeing with another quantum physicist on a scientific hypothesis that’s new in their field, it’s new frontier so them disagreeing is different than them disagreeing on breakfast.   And a scientific hypothesis is rigorously tested and reviewed before it becomes a theory. Theories are generally held as the best approximation to fact that we have about such topics. No one doubts the theory of gravity for example, so I don’t know what theories you are talking about that people don’t trust.   Covid was a new and emerging disease in 2020, there were no theories about it besides the best ways to combat most diseases, which were updated as new limited info came in, but were also constantly pushed back against by people that believed they could prevent the disease through faith or politicians that wanted to score easy points with fearful constituents. Everywhere was afraid of coronaviruses before 2020 bc of SARS-cov, and while the COVID virus was relatively defeated as of now, it killed millions in a few years and left many with long COVID, something we still haven’t solved.   I’m just going to stop on science and say I disagree with you, as it can be its own talking point (science as well as covid).

"Making major changes to the scopes of individual agencies or creating a bunch of new ones is unlikely to happen and no, I’m not in favor of more bureaucracy. When forming these agencies, Congress should limit their authority. They could implement some policies, but should not be allowed to create law or penalties. They could make recommendations and Congress could just have an up or down vote. They have to answer to their constituents. Unelected bureaucrats don’t.   Scientists within the same discipline frequently disagree on theories within their fields. For example, the 97% agreement number we constantly hear about climate change is *only* in regard to the statement that temperatures have risen by 1° C (or whatever the exact number is) over the last X number of years. It also includes scientists who aren’t climatologists. They do not agree on the amount caused by humans (some is) or the implications of the warming. I’m not trying to start a climate debate here, just pointing out that the science isn’t “settled” as some people keep saying. Much more research is being done and needs to be done. Knee-jerk policies and associated penalties should not be subject to the whims of whoever is running the EPA at the moment.   COVID was a huge unknown, but that didn’t stop many policies from being unequally implemented at  various levels of government out of panic. Millions died, but COVID was blamed for many that it should not have been. Hospitals were financially incentivized to make COVID the cause of death, even when it wasn’t. People who died *with* COVID were lumped in with people who died *from* COVID. Deaths from influenza mysteriously went [down](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1124915/flu-deaths-number-us/) during those years. The reactionary policy-making caused companies to go out of business. Many people lost jobs. And nobody should ever be forced to have any substance injected into their bodies against their will unless they are being put to death for capital murder. I am specifically taking about unelected people unilaterally creating policy and implementing penalties out of panic. People were literally thrown in crowded jails for participating in an outdoor church service. How does that make any sense?  RFK, Jr. should be able to express his opinions and make his recommendations, but he should not be able to take away the opportunity for people to be vaccinated.

"What’s the point of making a policy that says you can’t dump polluted waste water into the river if you can’t make a penalty for breaking the policy?   Congress does not need to actually answer to its constituents. It’s why so few town halls are actually held, and why when they are most of them are tightly controlled and turn into rallies for the congress critters rather than actual town halls. We can see with current events that virtual town halls are being held instead of physical ones bc of all the backlash congress has been getting from its constituents, and even then not a lot of virtual town halls are happening.   Highlighting one scientific field that has a 97% consensus on climate change happening and being man made, but disagreeing on impact and amount is hardly disagreement, but I agree to stop having this part of a debate since it can’t go much of anywhere.   If you had Covid+something else and you died, Covid is one of the leading factors for death, is it not? If a person is shot and the bleed out to death, the bullet is still the main reason they died even as blood loss is culprit. I don’t understand why you think deaths related to Covid in that way wouldn’t also be counted as Covid.   It’s also not a mystery why influenza went down during this period if ppl were taking safety precautions that would prevent the spread of all diseases. Wearing a mask was as likely to protect from influenza particles as much as it was Covid particles. Distancing is good for the prevention of all diseases. Isolation is good for the prevention of all diseases. It’s not really a mystery unless you don’t know what types of things were done to prevent the spread of disease during the time period.   Most companies or whatnot survived around me. I started a business, that’s still going strong, in 2020. If some companies went out of business it’s likely that they were struggling before it and would have struggled even if COVID didn’t happen.   Defying mandates and emergency orders will get people thrown in jail. A quick search said a pastor did, but I didn’t look farther than article titles. This seems a like a whataboutism.   RFK Jr. is the head of HHS, his unique position means he should not be saying outlandish claims without backing it up with vast amounts of data his department likely has. Instead we hear that autistic ppl will never find love, never have a job, never pay taxes. He’s an unqualified conspiracy theorist whose opinion should not be heard and recommendations ignored. He thought dumping a bear carcass in a park was funny. He is likely not a sane individual and in no way did he merit his position.",etoneishayeuisky,2025-04-19T08:52:31,1
"Fair enough.  If you understand this I’m sure you would agree that the US is less socialistic than just about every other OECD nation.  Just look at healthcare. So much profit being skimmed off the top in the US by private entities or just being wasted by healthcare staff having to spend hours chasing payments and government funded health only being available to a small proportion of the population.  I live in Australia.      Other than the 1.5% tax I’ve paid my entire working life the only out of pocket money I’ve spent on healthcare including ambulance trips has been a couple of hundred dollars for specialists over the last 5 years. I visit a doctor 3-4 times a year 1 or 2 blood tests a year.  How much would that have cost in the US even if you had health insurance?  I’m old and out of shape so I take medication for type 2 diabetes, depression and cholesterol it costs me about $40AUD or about $26USD a month or about 2-3 hours  work at minimum wage after tax is deducted.  You know why? Because our government stops companies from profiteering (and please note I said profiteering as opposed to profiting) on something that is a social good.      This is a social democracy here, I like it as does most of the voting population, which by the way is everyone, it’s compulsory.",au-smurf,2025-04-12T08:53:19,1
"Congress answers to its constituents every two years for the house and every six years for the Senate. Unelected bureaucrats cannot make law.

They did not agree on cause and they were scientists from multiple disciplines, not only climatology.   If the flu dropped so dramatically, why didn’t COVID?  You said ALL diseases. You mean ALL diseases but one.   You started a business and it’s till going strong, so that automatically applies to everyone?  Being outside and socially distanced (something they pulled out of their asses because there was no science behind this decision) is not against the law. Point to a law if you think I’m wrong.

"American health care is a disgrace. I am old and disabled but luckily I live in the best state in the country for socialized health care. Since I am on social security disability and have no resources to speak of all of my healthcare is 100% free. Doctor's appointments, medications, even surgeries and mental health visits are 100% covered. My arthritis medication alone is over $100,000 per year. I think everybody should have the health care that I have. I am extremely disappointed in this nation's performance when it comes to health care and voting also. It's an embarrassment. Americans tend to be uneducated and conceited which is a dangerous combination. It looks like we are quickly becoming a failed democracy which is probably the correct outcome considering the stupidity and apathy of the voting population.

"RFK Jr. said autistic people will never find love, will never have a job, will never pay taxes, and yet we have ample examples of autistic people doing all those. As a prime example Elon Musk is autistic and still managed to greed his way to a huge fortune.   I have no idea about your luggage or bathroom claims.   The city settled with the litigants. The police acted excessively wrong, like they usually do. If lockdown mandates were present to prevent disease spread and people violated them, even if it’s within their 1st amendment right to assemble in a safer manner, it’s still defying mandates out of imagined special privilege.   You missed the mention that most companies/businesses around me seemed to have stayed in business throughout the lockdown and covid. I wasn’t claiming that just my business is representative of every business. There’s also the fact that 10-20% of business startups don’t make it and that restaurants have particularly slim margins and likely would have a hard time surviving during early covid.   Covid particles are smaller and thus more likely to slip through masks, so whereas a mask can give some protection it isn’t foolproof. Flu and other diseases are bigger particles so they are likelier to get stopped by masks. Not to mention that people were warned and were better with their sanitation methods during early covid so it was eliminating a lot of common vectors that common diseases took to infect people. Considering rates rose again as efforts to prevent spread waned, it would indicate that prevention helped. Heck, the initial lockdowns were to buy time so that the healthcare industry wouldn’t be overwhelmed as much and could acquire more robust ppe gear supply routes.  Scientists agree on more than your one data point. They agree on the theory of gravity for instance. They agree on the human anatomy models. They agree on how math works for their various fields. If you pick up any current field and go to its outer bounds of understanding you are sure to get disagreement for now as data still comes in to support or disprove hypotheses in said fields. Talking about the outer boundaries of climatology like it should be settled science by now is ridiculous. Pretending that scientists are not in general harmony with each other is ridiculous because you’re trying to point at wedges and call them mountains.   Scientists from fields outside of climatology can still use their critical thinking skills to form basic opinions on fields (like climatology) they are not well versed in.   Congress only “answering” to its constituents every 2 or 6 years is a ridiculous statement. They should be answering to them monthly when big events are happening and legislation is getting debated. If congress gave agencies authority to make policy and hired competent agency heads there wouldn’t be a problem. Regulations save lives, regulations keep people employed, regulations keep companies in check. Unelected bureaucrat agency heads are elected through congress. If every government employee needed to be elected by the citizens or congress you’d be essentially asking for more bloated bureaucracy, but you said you don’t want that.   I assume you want a functional government, but the policies you are demanding would make government dysfunctional. Congress would spend all day hiring bureaucrats instead of ever passing laws or running the country further.",etoneishayeuisky,2025-04-20T02:41:36,1
"Executive branch agency heads are unelected. Every two to six years is infinitely more often than when they face voters. You’re also arguing for their continued ability to unconstitutionally create laws and penalties and against RFK, Jr. doing it.  He should not be able to make these laws just like all the rest. You’re arguing with yourself.   Google [“Sam Brinton”](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Sam+Brinton%22) or [“Rachel Levine”](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Rachel+Levine%22) for starters.   The U.S. Constitution and all of its amendments are the final law in this country. They supersede ALL other laws, ordinances, mandates, and any other form of legislation or government policy-making at every government level. There is no special privilege. The imagined part is the authority *anyone* thinks they might have to pass laws that violate the Constitution.   Viruses are incredibly tiny — *all viruses*. COVID viruses are 50-140 nanometers in size while flu viruses are 80-120 nanometers, which falls entirely within the range for COVID. Even if COVID viruses were smaller, they would obviously not be stopped by masks, making that mandate stupid as well as unconstitutional.   97% of scientists do not agree on all theories about climate change. The only climate-related theory that they agreed on in *a single survey* in the 90s is that average global temperatures had raised approximately 1° C since we had started measuring. Furthermore, show me any survey ever where 100% of scientists were polled on any topic.  The 97% was from a select set of names who were sent the survey. 3% still disagreed. Galileo, Newton, Einstein and many others disagreed with conventional science in their times and were proven to be correct. This is how science works. Disagreement is how it advances.   Hit dog vendors and pole dancers might also have critical thinking skills. You do not have to have a degree in any particular field to understand a topic if you have a brain and can read. My point is that the climate has become more a political topic than a scientific one.   Congress wastes an enormous amount of time. They should focus on topics that actually matter and take fewer vacations. Regardless, executive agencies do not have constitutional authority to create laws and penalties. The Constitution is very clear on this topic. Read it. If you don’t like what it says, then try to get it changed, but it is the final authority in law.",thegarymarshall,2025-04-20T10:27:52,1
"Agencies were created by Congress. Congress explicitly gave them the power to use agency expertise to craft policy, and it’s a good system when not abused. Agency heads are elected by congress, specifically the senate, and bad agency heads wouldn’t be a problem if Congress was functioning as intended, instead of the extreme partisanship and wealth accumulation that happens today. When I harp on RFK Jr. it is bc he is a politician and a lawyer, and his anti-science stance shows that he doesn’t understand nor deserve his position at all.   Saying Congress is beholden to voters every 2 or 6 years is infinitely more democratic is pretty close to nonsense. It is more, but once every 365x2 or x6 days is a pathetic comparison. We may have RFK Jr. and Hegseth now, but they will be pushed out sooner than later by mass amounts of citizens decrying their stupidity and incompetency at their jobs. We citizens have no means to kick federal congress members out of their positions if they screw up, only Congress does, and Congress is highly partisan right now.   I clicked your links for Sam Brinton and they are a nuclear engineer, and Rachel Levine has been in the armed services corps a long time and is a pediatrician, so what are you trying to say? Were you trying to highlight that both are queer, and that somehow shows incompetence?   The constitution is the foundation of our laws, but we have a legislature and judicial branches for many reasons. We had a civil war bc of the constitution, bc it wasn’t good enough, bc it allowed slavery, bc it allowed discrimination based on skin color or gender. It’s also why we have amendments to the constitution. I support the constitution but we have more laws today that aren’t in the constitution for multiple reasons.   There are plenty of studies a basic documents out there that show if and how masks protect against covid and other diseases. And just like you complained that the vaccine doesn’t stop you from getting sick, you don’t seem to know how vaccines or covid are supposed to work. When a sick person breathes out disease travels out of their body through respiratory fluids, droplets and aerosols. If they are wearing a mask their respirations don’t travel far, and thus there is less likelihood others around them get infected. If others around them also mask (and distance too as is needed) it creates a barrier(s) to entering their bodies too. Vaccines give the immune system the understanding of how to fight a disease. The immune system doesn’t turn on and start fighting the disease till it detects it, so a person is still going to get sick if they breathe in/catch the disease, but they’ll be better able to fight it off. And bc covid was a new disease not many ppl had a chance to build an immunity to it, and so it was easier to have worse symptoms from catching the disease. That’s why masking and distancing and practicing good hand hygiene was important before the vaccine. You’re railing against vaccines and masks out of ignorance and misplaced anger.   I’m not going to respond to your further talk about 97% agreement or Galileo, Einstein, etc. bc you’re trying to make some inane point. Saying science progresses through disagreement is also inane. We could replace disagreement with lots of words, including collaboration, hypotheses, competing hypotheses, work, study, research. So yeah, science can progress through disagreement, but it’s all but a useless truism unless you actually back it up with more information.   The climate becoming more of a political topic than a scientific one is because of politicians not wanting to accept science and scientific facts and theories on the topic. I agree that critical thinking skills can be enough for some stuff, but knowing the lingo of a field, knowing equations of a field, knowing how to read charts thoroughly and correctly or being able to link various information together is more of an expert’s ability than the common laborer’s understanding. We have car mechanics fix cars bc they’ve trained to be experts at it, and we have airplane mechanical engineers determine how to build a more efficient engines bc they’ve trained to work and understand airplane engines. The common laborer probably isn’t keeping up with the latest findings in their hobby interests in the same way an actual physicist does.",etoneishayeuisky,2025-04-22T23:34:47,1
"The Constitution says:   *All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.*  The agencies we are talking about are in the Executive branch. They can exist, but they cannot create laws or impose penalties. They *can* enforce laws and execute the penalties defined by Congress.  *All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills.*  These agencies also cannot impose fees. They can collect fees as designated by Congress.   Last year, SCOTUS reined in the powers of Executive agencies because they have far overstepped their authority. We’ll see how things play out after that decision.   Citizens can kick members of Congress out by voting for someone else. Tell me how citizens can push RFK or Hegseth out. They stay until the President says they are out. It is his sole discretion.   I generally think vaccines are a god thing, COVID vaccines included. However, individuals must be able to decide for themselves. I got COVID early on, so I chose not to get vaxed. I can always reverse that decision if is choose. A close family member died of COVID five weeks after her second booster and she was infected by another vaxed person. We know that the COVID vaccine has killed people. Everyone should gather information and use their judgement to make their own decisions about what goes into their bodies.  You can’t compare cars or aircraft to the universe and the world in which we live. Cars and aircraft are made by men. We understand exactly how they work. Climate has countless variables and we are still learning about it. I’m not arguing climate change one way or the other here. I’m just saying that the science for climate change will most certainly change for such a complex topic that we have only been studying for a few decades. It is not settled.   In the 1970s, scientists predicted a coming ice age. Was it settled then because many scientists agreed on this prediction? We have also been told that we have X number of years before the world becomes uninhabitable. We have passed several of those predicted time periods Temperatures have gone up *and* down during that time. We are still learning and it is good that we continue to study this topic, but it is far from settled.",thegarymarshall,2025-04-23T09:38:22,1

The problem with this statement is that we have about 100 years (at most) of accurate temperature data for a 4.5 billion year old planet.
