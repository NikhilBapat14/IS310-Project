Republicans have been running Texas forever.. are they saying Republicans haven't been running the state efficiently?,Grandpa_No,2025-04-23T15:03:33,98
So Texas is going to go from a shithole to a shithole with no toilet paper.,AmrokMC,2025-04-23T15:06:19,18
"Ah of course, the Republicans that have been running the state for 30+ years allowed fraud and waste. I agree.",sugarlessdeathbear,2025-04-23T15:08:31,18
So the Republican Governor with a Republican controlled legislature formed a panel to (checks notes) curb the spending of the Republican Governor and Republican controlled legislature.,YesterShill,2025-04-23T15:11:10,16
"And that‚Äôs OK, since it was a bill proposed in the Texas Legislature and voted for by the Texas Legislature.  Now show me the federal authorization for Elon Musk‚Äôs team.",Grand_Stranger_3262,2025-04-23T15:11:30,9
He wants to cut waste in his own programs that he oversees in his own republican stronghold?   So he‚Äôs admitting that they have been wasteful and fraudulent?,softConspiracy_,2025-04-23T15:11:51,7
Right. Because the Texas Legislature is insufficiently pro-business.,Johnsense,2025-04-23T15:35:55,3
"This has nothing to do with spending.  It‚Äôs all about regulations.  Those nasty old regulations clogging up the system.   Nevermind that Republicans created most of those regulations.   This is even dumber than Musk DOGE.  Let‚Äôs bring in outsiders to decide which regulations are good and which are bad.  They‚Äôll know, right?  A recipe for disaster.",Fordinghamster,2025-04-23T15:38:27,3
Is this the handicapped governor that stopped funding all accessibility aids except wheelchair ramps? Lol,ColeBeasleyMD,2025-04-23T15:09:05,2
"GOP has run TX for decades, since 1995. Why did they wait so long to get rid of fraud, waste and abuse? When i bet each one ran on getting rid of fraud, waste and abuse to justify tax cuts. Ps. There wasn't much fraud, waste and abuse, just excuse to cut taxes.",No_Pirate9647,2025-04-23T17:10:00,2
Couldn‚Äôt they just use a list of Texas employees and a magic 8-ball?,ddr1ver,2025-04-23T15:47:21,1
"This gives them carte blanche, now anything that he deems wasteful is now gone. Pay attention folks! This is happening in real time!",nopulsehere,2025-04-23T15:49:38,1
There‚Äôs a non zero chance that republicans don‚Äôt touch a gavel or pen in any meaningful way for the next 50 years when all this smoke clears. They‚Äôre so utterly callous and incompetent. This will bite them in the ass sooner or later,No_Algae1379,2025-04-23T16:03:36,1
Fuck texas. Fuck wheel chair willie.,Exotic-Debt-8706,2025-04-23T16:40:35,1
Adios Texas,NorCal_commie,2025-04-23T20:39:30,1
Almost like it's first move could be to nip school vouchers in the bud....,Ok-Fennel-4463,2025-04-23T22:55:33,1
‚ÄúI‚Äôve done such a shitty job leading this state that I now need to hire a team of broccoli haired teenage cyber criminals to fuck up my mess beyond anyone‚Äôs wildest dreams and we‚Äôre gonna use your tax dollars to pay their salaries‚Äù,Ok-Delivery-9032,2025-04-23T23:14:39,1
Wheels up suckers!,mister_record,2025-04-24T12:59:41,1
Don't try to use logic here. You'll just confuse them even more.,dbkenny426,2025-04-23T15:05:23,45
"Exactly. Every savings they claim is waste they either created or fed, just like Floriduh.",USAFGeekboy,2025-04-23T15:05:27,15
Elon successfully managed to force doge into existence as a new fascist buzzword.  So now we'll never stop hearing about it.  It also showed Republicans you can mug their constituents in broad daylight and call it doge and they'll ask even fewer questions than normal.,Professional-Buy2970,2025-04-23T15:14:29,12
It‚Äôs probably to weed out all the non MAGA Republicans.,heismanwinner82,2025-04-23T15:06:15,10
They are currently a leader in green energy production because it is so cost effective. The GOP leaders say that needs to change. And they also learned they can cut all ethics boards and eliminate any ethics rules they have and claim they are cutting government waste.,Captain_Aware4503,2025-04-23T15:10:26,10
They just want an excuse to hurt people who did nothing wrong. It's a gang of criminals and in Texas it's absolutely a bunch of criminals for sure.,Actual__Wizard,2025-04-23T15:20:57,4
I doubt most Texas Republicans would admit that. They'd cling to the idea that dems are somehow destroying the state.,Kindly_Ice1745,2025-04-23T15:26:39,2
My MAGA friend was literally complaining about how immigrants negatively affected her when growing up to justify voting for Trump.   Republicans have controlled Texas since she was born. Lmao,Odd_Perfect,2025-04-23T16:01:58,1
Everything they do tells on themselves! Shock the idiots who can‚Äôt figure out how to motivate people to have kids or stop mass shootings what do defund an already bare bones government.,h8hannah8h,2025-04-23T17:30:48,1
A shithole without toilet paper‚Ä¶and they forgot to dig the hole,New-Development8565,2025-04-23T15:24:06,3
Don‚Äôt worry. They‚Äôll just use this to go after Houston.,ExZowieAgent,2025-04-23T15:15:52,7
"So, Texas saw what an utter shit-show DOGE was, how much damage it caused and that it cost more then it saved.\ And there reaction was ""Man, I want me some of that!""   Jeeszh, Texans are _weird"" even for Republicans.",Brokenandburnt,2025-04-23T15:47:40,3
I'm sure this is somehow Biden's fault.,BadgeOfDishonour,2025-04-23T17:38:31,1
Isn't Houston's mayor kind of doing that for them at this point?,Kindly_Ice1745,2025-04-23T15:27:43,3
They're just going to try and fuck over Democrat led areas because they're that fucking cruel. It will end up hurting their own voters too but they don't really care.,2_Spicy_2_Impeach,2025-04-23T15:16:40,2
It's to go after all of the major cities in TX.,Udjet,2025-04-23T15:51:31,1
Of course. Maybe even Obama‚Äôs. üòâ,New-Development8565,2025-04-23T18:35:42,1
Apparently so.   https://abc13.com/amp/post/houston-mayor-john-whitmire-enforces-citywide-hiring-freeze-response-citys-350-million-budget-deficit/15981151/,ExZowieAgent,2025-04-23T15:31:42,2
And fighting public transit. Isn't he also going to campaign with Crenshaw?  How long until he does what the Dallas mayor did and switch to republican?,Kindly_Ice1745,2025-04-23T15:32:43,2
[He basically did in 2003](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Whitmire#Redistricting) by defecting against his own party.,DontCovfefeMyHeart,2025-04-23T16:13:46,1
