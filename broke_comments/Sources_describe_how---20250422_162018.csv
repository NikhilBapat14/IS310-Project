I genuinely don’t understand how an official government communications phone was stolen and not tracked/recovered within minutes.,Casual_hex_,2025-04-22T16:26:27,22
"*“Her entire family was in town including her children and grandchildren – she was using the withdrawal to treat her family to dinner, activities, and Easter gifts.”*    Now, all you normal Americans: who of you, knowing the convenience, ease, and security of credit cards, chose to 'pay cash' to the tune of $3000 with none of the protection that credit cards provide?   I call bullpucks*.  *: not 'bullpucks'.  Edit: BTW, if you were to try to procure a hotel room for even **one night**, solely with cash, you would incur a rash of resistance: need of a credit card, anyways, a sizeable cash deposit, outright denial, simply because the risk (thousands of dollars in potential damage to the room with no restitution for the hotel) far outweighs the cash in hand.",Stellar_Stein,2025-04-22T16:34:45,18
This is the person in charge of protecting the homeland,gradientz,2025-04-22T16:21:32,25
wonder if she arranged the purse with the phone to be stolen by a Russian agent? everyone thinks this is incompetence but it could have been w way for her to get one of these phones into Russian hands.,JaVelin-X-,2025-04-22T17:19:07,11
Nobody carries $3k cash in 2025.   You can’t convince me that you don’t know how to use a card.,MeatPrestigious3597,2025-04-22T16:56:22,8
So Ms. Homeland Security cant secure her own purse? Huh.,Independent_Fun_2708,2025-04-22T17:09:38,7
"Honestly, in the case of rich people's problems like this one - I am kinda rooting for the thief.  I mean who carries that much money around without keeping an eye on it?  And what does that say about her obscene level of wealth and her gross carelessness - I'm not sure which one I find more repugnant - but together they make me lose all sympathy with her.",Truthisnotallowed,2025-04-22T17:23:03,7
"Rookie.  Non puppy killers always put their purse on the seat where they can see it.  Edit: Also, you never put your money on the floor. It’s like these “non coastal elitist folks” never even folked before.",LuvKrahft,2025-04-22T16:23:02,7
The point is the leader of Homeland Security is not secure and extra stupid besides.  I would focus on the badge being stolen and the phone(s).  Under her chair?  Idiot.  The money is secondary except that they grilled Fani Willis over having cash on hand,spotmuffin9986,2025-04-22T20:33:13,3

"When Secretary Noem arose from her chair, she discovered that the thief had also stolen her panties. The secret service was unable to explain how the thief accomplished this while she was seated at the table. One agent commented ""I guess he's really good at what he does.""",FitWrap1959,2025-04-22T18:39:01,1

"Agree on safety for large purchases, but if you care about local businesses (so, small mom and pop outfits, not Target), use cash when possible. The credit card company takes like 3% or something from the transaction.",erocuda,2025-04-23T08:54:49,2

"This is correct. Many smaller eateries and bodegas have a cash-only policy (with a nearby ATM that they get a cut from) to help their bottom line by bypassing those 3% (2% for Discover! ha, ha) surcharges and being tied into the credit card system. *Some* allow debit cards but most I have seen just state **cash only** to, I guess, sidestep any 'why don't you take credit cards if you have a card reader, right there' confrontations. More power to them.  That said, I don't see Noem patronizing any bodegas or halal trucks on Easter, even if they were the only businesses open, at the time. Maybe, I am missing something but, I don't think so... 😕  Have a happy!",Stellar_Stein,2025-04-23T12:03:07,2
