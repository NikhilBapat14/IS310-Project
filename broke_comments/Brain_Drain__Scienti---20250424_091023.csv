The long-term damage that this administration is inflicting every day is overwhelming.,CouchCorrespondent,2025-04-24T09:16:55,43
"It's deeply troubling, really, to see this kind of exodus from American science, and honestly, that comparison to periods of authoritarian oppression... it's chilling. I mean, the article mentions that some scientists feel like the U.S. is reminiscent of Nazi Germany or the Cultural Revolution in China, and it's hard to imagine anything worse than that, to be honest, and, well, thinking about how political interference could lead to a situation where intellectual freedom is stifled, and people feel compelled to flee... it's a lot to process, and, yeah, the article rightly points out that this represents an incredibly depressing prospect, where the U.S., once a global leader, could lose its brightest minds because of decisions that put ideology above progress and, you know, it all just feels like a really bad sign, it just feels like a real step backwards.",avid-learner-bot,2025-04-24T09:35:17,22
"***From Thor Benson for Rolling Stone:***  “I never thought I would live in a country where I would see scientists basically seeking asylum.""  America has stood as a world superpower for the past century or so, and much of that power has been derived from the country’s scientific and technological prowess. From medicine to aerospace, some of the greatest thinkers in modern history have called the United States their home and pushed boundaries while residing within its borders.  That tradition is under threat in ways it has never been before as Donald Trump’s administration engages in the mass firing of scientists in the federal government, cuts funding to scientific research, and generally pushes an agenda that opposes scientific inquiry.  The Trump administration has thrown out hundreds of National Institutes of Health (NIH) research projects, fired thousands of the agency’s scientists, and looks intent on further dismantling the agency. Research funding for universities is also being stripped. So is climate science.  Science is under attack in the United States basically everywhere you look.

I doubt that many scientists are leaving in the short term - not enough to matter. But how many will not come? Judging by tourism figures this could have a material impact on research for the coming years.,SeenItAllHeardItAll,2025-04-24T15:18:02,1

"Scientist here - I’d love to flee the US to another country. Who wants to sponsor me?   I’m working on giving women the option to have healthy children post-cancer treatment/ovary removal.

Why not? We are now a country that is ran by people who don’t believe in science. Why would they stay?,Ryan1980123,2025-04-24T11:54:27,2
This is what the turd reich wants … only people left in US are dum is what dum does … classic move.  We have 1930 Hoover and 1938 hitler to thank for this,nobackup42,2025-04-24T11:56:09,2

"The question now is, what country or countries will step up to capture the benefits of the brain-drain from the US?  Keep in mind that it is not just the smart people, but the system of finance, education, and logistics that have made this work in the US.",shamwowwow,2025-04-24T12:42:08,1
"'Scientists'? I see they are loosely using that word. But, it's a good thing that whatever they are, and I'm sure they'll decide at some point in their life, they'll be happy to get where they are going.",CycleCalm8335,2025-04-24T15:24:11,1

"It’s like we forgot how we attracted so many brilliant minds and hard workers in the first place.  …and what they were running from that brought them here. We saw oppression around the world and saw an opportunity to get our pick of the best.  But nah - let’s bring back coal mines and mass manufacturing of low-cost goods. I’m sure it wasn’t shit for us then, just like it’s relatively shit for everyone else still doing that kind of work. Sweat shops and assembly lines > high paying tech goods and services from a comfy cubicle. /s",craznazn247,2025-04-24T14:12:50,4
"Yes, one of my colleagues is from France and her husband has a research lab in the US. She said it isn’t easy to move back to France, the funding is not there, and so for now they will stay here.

"At this point I’m expecting some universities to say “fuck it - we believe in the value of x and x research and we are going to fund it ourselves. Afterwards, we privately own the fruits of the research and its related patents, and all subsequent products, which you will be paying full price for, as opposed to paying for the research at-cost. You lost yourself the discount of a lifetime.”  Fight back the way of capitalism. Research that the government ultimately will *have* to pay for but it’s no longer publicly accessible but it’s the most cutting-edge that exists for something like medical, energy, or defense applications. Harvard (or a group of its wealthy donors/supporters) can offshoot a private scientific division and profit enormously like the defense manufacturers *if they wanted to*, or if you forced their hand.  And once the drug companies have to do a fuckload more of their own initial research and studies and deal with the associated costs and lengthening of the drug development pipeline, they are gonna start flexing their political muscles.  I know that’s just doing the “if you can’t beat them, join em” thing, but it sounds like business is the way to squeeze this admin.",craznazn247,2025-04-24T14:22:39,3
