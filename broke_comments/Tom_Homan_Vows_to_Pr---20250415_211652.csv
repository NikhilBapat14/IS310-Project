"My home state sub is going crazy. They are afraid their precious Fred Flintstone looking governor is being threatened and they are making some comments that I've been reporting not to Reddit, but to higher powers. Funny how they suddenly are in support of the 2nd Amendment.  They think they are going to start and win an internal conflict, different that 45ish% of is voted for Trump. I can't post there anymore, but I can screenshot threats and report get comments and users removed.",Mysterious_Main_5391,2025-04-16T08:06:11,10
Good. How about actually doing this already? Please and thank you.,PrinceOfPooPoo,2025-04-15T21:18:53,15
"Yeah, sure you will, Tom.  How many mayors of sanctuary cities have you arrested? What's that? Democrats don't get arrested in this country? Oh, ok.",Peregrine_Falcon,2025-04-16T11:08:39,2
"Maybe they can put RICO to good use here? Just an idea.      If some group is harboring/hiding/other wise helping illegal immigrants who commit crimes covered under RICO (things like money laundering, drug trafficking, extortion, etc) then could they get RICO thrown at them?",DonkeyMilker69,2025-04-15T22:41:54,3

"depending how things go, eventually it might include citizens who foolishly married illegal immigrants. That have no asylum claim, no green card, no status. They indeed are encouraging them to stay in the usa which is a crime..a felony i think",SerendipitySue,2025-04-15T22:49:54,-2

"They've been doing it, one of the ICE raids in San Diego a few weeks ago saw [the general manager charged with conspiracy to harbor aliens](https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/large-federal-law-enforcement-presence-in-el-cajon/3789378/).",ChristopherRoberto,2025-04-16T02:00:27,13
"You’re getting downvoted and I’m not sure why.  It’s not a bad question.  I think it comes down to the statutory seriousness of being an illegal alien.  Doesn’t rise to being a criminal organization.  But, there needs to be a first case and try it out.  I remember hearing RICO used in creative ways in the past.",j3remy2007,2025-04-16T05:31:43,4
My first reaction was that’s a little harsh.  But I think you’re right.  All of these stories of breaking up families really is of their own making.,j3remy2007,2025-04-16T05:28:21,1
well it is harsh. but it may be done. not like they married a green card person. i do not know if ice will get to that level unless the spouse  and illegal are both involved in other criminal behavior. Say your illegal spouse hit and run or even shoplifted. You sort of lie about his or her whereabouts.   I could see ice going after the spouse along with the illegal immigrant.,SerendipitySue,2025-04-16T16:44:18,4
