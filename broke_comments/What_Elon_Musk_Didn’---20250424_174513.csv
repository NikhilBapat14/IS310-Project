Just another example why the government is not like running a business nor should it be.   “The Education of Elon” seems like a good title for a book.,RamonaQ-JunieB,2025-04-24T17:52:44,1

"> Mr. Musk has said without providing details that DOGE is likely to save taxpayers only $150 billion. That is about 15 percent of the $1 trillion he pledged to save, less than 8 percent of the $2 trillion in savings he had originally promised and a fraction of the nearly $7 trillion the federal government spent in the 2024 fiscal year.  So wait…Americans aren’t getting $5000 stimmy checks with all the “savings” he found after all? That’s about as surprising as finding out a man who’s famous for being rich and hailed by Internet dweebs as a “business genius” doesn’t understand the logistics and finance of actually running a business and just makes impulsive decisions about what’s in his best interest.",EggsAndMilquetoast,2025-04-24T18:10:46,1
It's like when Michael Scott started his own paper company and undercut every other company in price only to find out to grow his company he would need a lot more money for those additional expenses he wasn't thinking about and thus needed to charge a lot more.,TaxGuy2930,2025-04-24T18:09:09,1
