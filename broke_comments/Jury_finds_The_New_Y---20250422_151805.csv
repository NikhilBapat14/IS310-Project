"Idk, seems like the sort of thing most lawyers wouldn't take up.   The original op-ed revolved around the writer's belief that violent rhetoric was building a culture of violence. They correctly pointed out Palin (or her people) had published a map with Gifford's district in crosshairs [which was accompanied by messages from Palin using phrases like ""take a stand,"" ""take aim"" and ""reload""]. However, they immediately changed it when it was pointed out the shooter in that particular case didn't seem to have any political motivation.  If you take her lawsuit at face value you're suggesting she really was going to prove that the NYT connected the shooter to her map and rhetoric, knowing he was not influenced by it, and with intent to harm her reputation...in an *opinion* piece. Now, she has threatened lawsuits before, so maybe she's just very litigious (allegedly, according to my opinion...I don't want sued). Even if she is though, seems unlikely she was ever going to win that one.  So why would a lawyer take that case if it was so unlikely to win? Well, I'd suggest it wasn't about winning. In my opinion it's either more likely because she had a book that was about to come out after a long time out of the spotlight (woops! Ended up going to court on the same day -in the same court- Donald Trump did! So much for the spotlight.) OR there has been a noted strategy amongst right wing think tanks the last few years of simply throwing spaghetti at a wall in hopes that cases which could be tied to outcomes they want from SCOTUS make it that far. A case against a publisher now could be used to reverse the SCOTUS's previous decision that publishers can't be held liable for simple mistakes, and that would seem like something the current incarnation of the Republican party would see as a big win.  That second option seems less likely to me, but given the nature of the strategy and that she probably floats around some of the same circles as the people who've been enacting it, it's worth leaving the door open to.",Vandal_A,2025-04-23T02:12:38,2
