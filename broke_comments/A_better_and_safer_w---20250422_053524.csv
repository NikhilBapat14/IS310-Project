Many of you are too young but all this was affordable before the Reagan trickle down economics.  I made a great wage then the “new” economy took my benefits away and my wages dropped 30%.

"There are 2 things that are much more important:  1) Quality employment opportunities - for this to be done, 2 things need to change. First, quality job opportunities are way too concentrated in too few metro areas. This is a big problem. When Amazon was looking for a new site a few years back it was down to NYC and DC. These are the last 2 cities they should have been looking at, these places are already saturated and are very expensive. The government should do a better job incentivizing companies to go to places like Rochester, NY and Detroit, MI, etc. Second, the incentives that currently exist for tech companies (where there are many good paying jobs) and educational institutions are to favor international students, who pay more tuition and are working at a company not just for a salary and benefits, but also for a visa. The universities are really selling the visa. The same is true of university research labs, where they are locked and forced to work for the visa for years. The result is public universities and tech companies work together to favor these students in all sorts of ways. Asian students over Asian-American students. This is a catastrophe. How can public systems work against the public? We have universities with graduate cybersecurity courses with 100 students and none of them are Americans. Not because Americans are not interested in the topic, there are an enormous number of unemployed American cybersecurity workers, no, because the Universities and the tech firms don't want them there ($). American men are being squeezed out of opportunities by foreign men in things like software engineering. This already happened in construction (read about the LA Times decade-long story on the LA Construction industry) .The scale of this has gotten completely out of control. If men are not in jobs that signal future earning, women are not interested, and men have no confidence and turn inwards and get angry. We are killing our own kids' futures. Note, I have seen all of this happen first hand at the university level and the tech company level and nobody ever does anything about it. Sadly, it seems Trump is the one doing something about it, taking a sledgehammer to the problem.  2) Housing - I'm not one of these ridiculous people who think government is the source of all problem. Government can and should do great things to help its people. Leaving housing entirely to the private sector gets costly everything. Note, I'm not really in favor of public housing or rent control, per se, but the government should have a vision and play a more active role, first on a small scale, in trying to incentivize young people to get out on their own. There are huge numbers of unused housing units in places like Baltimore and Detroit and I know people will roll their eyes at that but people used to do that about the Bronx which is making a huge comeback. Why not give free abandoned housing units in Baltimore to any young American who will pay for its renovation and then help work out how such renovations will happen. Note, I am not naive, I realize this could be abused and investors might try and seize the opportunity to figure out how to make a fortune and change nothing, likely by trying to dramatically increase immigration and fill such renovated units with new arrivals, i.e. the Canadian model that Trudeau was using that pissed off so many Canadians.  Anyway, employment and housing are the two most important things and knowing lots of young people they are all really suffering in this regard, even many high achievers who have complete college and have outstanding resumes are finding no one wants them and they have little opportunity to get ahead.",DetectiveBlackCat,2025-04-22T12:23:26,1

There's also a market squeeze phenomenon going on right now that I'm not sure people have caught onto yet. Companies with access to big data know how much you can manage to scrounge and pay for something. Prices adjust far more quickly than they did a generation ago.   Fewer people having kids, especially when they're young, gives leeway for companies/markets to raise prices since those people don't have to deal with childcare costs that were the norm a generation ago.
