"From the article:  China canceled 12,000 metric tons of United States pork shipments amid a high-stakes trade standoff between the superpowers, according to data released Thursday.   China, one of the biggest U.S. trading partners, axed 12,000 metric tons of U.S. pork orders, the data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) shows.  China, behind Mexico and Japan, was the U.S.’s third-biggest market for pork in 2024, importing some 475,000 metric tons valued at more than $1.1 billion.   China is the world’s biggest producer of pork, accounting for nearly 50 percent of global supply at around 57 million metric tons, according to the USDA. The U.S. was ranked third at 11 percent with 12 million metric tons.   China said Thursday that the U.S. is not engaged in talks to come up with a new trade deal, a characterization that Trump rejected later in the day.",kootles10,2025-04-24T18:43:35,1

"I suspect that a lot of the trade entered into by China with the US has been made not on the basis of trade itself but for strategic purposes.   China has targeted industries for imports not on the basis of it being the best price or due to a supply shortage from other exporting nations. The strong USD makes its exports costly to begin with and shipping across the Pacific adds to this cost.  Now that the US has declared a trade war on China it is now able to retaliate by cancelling orders and sourcing alternatives at a lower cost from economies with weaker currencies and in closer proximity.  Australia is now picking up the trade in newly cancelled US beef exports and LNG due to proximity and exchange rate. It , and other economies , can ramp up production of these and fill the gaps left by the US. China then benefits from lower priced imports.  Part of the insane demands on Australia is for it to buy American beef. Australia it is not only a beef exporting economy but also has restrictions on growth hormone tainted foods. Cancellation of US beef into China now means that Australia can take its place and increase its exports.   At the same time Australia has gone from a huge pre-tariff trade deficit with the USA to now having a trade surplus due to surging gold exports triggered by demand from nervous investors.  I doubt very much that the US will ever recover this trade even if tariffs are lifted. China will not enter into any trade discussions while tariffs are in place. If they are dropped then I suspect that any discussions with China will have it demanding a free trade agreement.  The US has snookered itself and this trade war was lost before it began.",iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-04-24T19:58:06,1

China is forcing their veraions of Amazon Walmart etc to inject 10s of billions of dollars into the chinese economy to offset the loss of markets and sell those formerly U.S Destined products back to the Chinese consumer at a steep discount, the factories are still rolling for the most part and if not the people are having wages paid and subsidized   And what is trump doing? Eating paint chips, strip searching german backpackers and holding U.S citizens in immigration detention while negotiating with himself publicly on tariffs and likely locking up and snarling the supply lines even longer ensuring shortages and price spikes in a couple weeks when everyone runs out of inventory from China   Trump and the GOP are already fucked they just dont realize it yet because theyre so fucking inept and stupid they dont even realize whats happened.  Shipping at the docks from China has already fallen off a fucking cliff all the shit that evaporated in April was basically stock for May in our ""Just in timedelivery"" economy, retailers and wholesalers are quietly saying they only have a couple weeks of supply left before they run out and even if trump did a complete 180 15 minutes from when i post this the slack and lag in the system means its going to be at least a month or 2 before supply/products come in again...everyone canceled or refused orders already, that shit is gone, off to be resold at a discount in China or to a new market that Pooh Bear set up and negotiated over the past few weeks, and with trump yesterday saying ""oh, the tariffs wont be a 140% soon, theyll go down"" means NO ONE is going to place those orders to replenish their stock because theyre going to get FUCKED on price when trump backs off and drops the tariffs-- so that dodnt settle or smooth anything out it just snarls things even more, add more uncertainty   The GOP and Trump ran the economy off a cliff like Wile E.

"I don't think I've ever witnessed a president be so singlehandedly responsible for destabilizing the global economy.  It's also no surprise that Trump is trying desperately to blame these outcomes on anyone or any*thing* else but himself and his own actions and policies.  And policies, mind you, that damn near every economist warned us about. It's not like these were wild predictions either.  Current estimates show that a recession is around the corner, with real GDP growth for the first quarter coming in negative at -2.2 percent.  When Trump caved on his ""liberation day"" tariffs, he claimed that dozens of countries were coming to the negotiating table, when in fact, the current administration is struggling to make deals with these other countries, including Japan, one of our largest trading partners.  And let's be clear here, Trump didn't back down because these other world leaders were ""kissing his ass,"" he backed down because his policies are reckless and ill conceived, while he was likely being pressured by his advisors to pull back on some of these damaging trade policies. And by pressure I mean that his closest allies were probably pleading with Trump the same way a parent does when they're trying to get their child to eat vegetables.  No, these countries aren't kissing Trump's ass, they're being alienated and some are even being forced to take a harsher stance against the U.S. In other words, Trump is welcoming retaliation, which actually has the opposite intended effect when it comes to reducing the trade deficit.  And what's worse is that as Trump continues to escalate economic and diplomatic tensions between us and these other countries, they are being incentivized to turn to China! And believe it or not, China has their collective shit together and can weather the storm a hell of a lot better than we can.  And this has also turned out to be a massive failure because before Trump upended global trade, the US was in a much better position to economically isolate China!  This point needs to be emphasized over and over again. China's economy has expanded and grown at an exponential rate over the years. They have the means, the population, the resources, the bureaucracy, the workforce, etc, to win a trade war against the US nine times out of ten.  Now, keep in mind that Trump has still imposed sweeping tariffs on a wide range of goods, products and services from dozens of countries, while he continues to escalate matters with China one day, but backpedal on his policies the next.  He obviously never learned his lesson from last time. Because not only did Trump start a trade war with China during his first term, which led to harmful consequences for American businesses and consumers, but he also managed to increase the trade deficit at the same time.  But his supporters will tell you that this time it's different, even though he failed to balance the trade deficit last time when our tariff policies weren't as sweeping and haphazard as they are now.  They'll also explain that this is just all ""part of the plan"" to force other countries to start treating the United States ""fairly.""  Yes, the United States—which has spent the last several decades making itself the centerpiece of the current global trade system—is now the victim of the system it helped build in the first place.  I've come to realize that this talking point—which Trump uses to justify his reckless trade policies—is merely a broader representation of the right's insistence that they are being constantly victimized by the powers that be. Except in this case, it's on a global scale.  That being said, none of this has kept Trump's spokespeople from going to bat for him, claiming that he's playing ""3D chess""  while lying to Americans about the long term effectiveness of his ""genius"" policies. ""It's all part of the plan."" What plan? You've shown us that there is no immutable plan here, that there is no certainty or stability whatsoever, and that the current administration is entirely untrustworthy.  This is all while Trump continues to make allies of enemies and enemies of allies as he fails to follow through on his ""day one"" promises.  In fact, it appears that Trump is more interested now in readmitting Russia back into the international club, than he is committed to negotiating a peace between Ukraine and its land grabbing enemy, nay, *our* enemy.  And yes, the flagrant hypocrisy of Trump and his supporters has been on full display these past few months.  Where in the past they used the stock market, CPI data, consumer confidence, price increases, Fed announcements, etc, as major metrics for indicating that a democrat president was doing a terrible job with the economy. But this time around, they're bending over backwards to defend Trump while trying desperately to rationalize why poor economic trends and ominous predictions about where the economy is headed are no big deal.  What's worse is that most of the economic issues we faced under Biden were a direct result of the global pandemic and its reverberating shock on the economy. On the other hand, most of the economic issues we have today are the direct result of one man's actions.  And Trump is such a vindictive, insecure, pretentious idiot that he doesn't realize, nor does he care that his rhetoric and actions are having the opposite intended effect on the economy. He doesn't realize that threatening to fire Jerome Powell will force markets into a tailspin. He's even gone on national TV and admitted that he ""couldn't care less"" if businesses raise their prices!  All those people who claimed they voted for Trump because he's a ""businessman"" don't realize that Trump is indeed running the country like he does his businesses, straight into the ground...",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-04-24T22:57:26,1

One way to produce the best yield of crop is to alternate between corn and soybean every season. While I’m sure some farmers don’t alternate, the vast majority do.  And the focus should be on removing subsidies for large farming companies, not family farms. It can cost a farmer hundreds of thousands of dollars a year just to start the planting season.

One reason might be from there being different varieties of pork.  Another might be from the various products made from pork.  For example they might produce hams or bacons that are popular in the US for more profit than those cuts might make on the domestic market.,grandzooby,2025-04-24T21:18:39,1
"Happens a lot with international trade that you end up exporting and importing the same product. Reasons can be:  - Differences in harvest time can make it more economical to import/export seasonally.  - Different cultural preferences for specific cuts. China may demand more of certain specific cuts than they can provide domestically.   - Different subspecies of pork exist.   - Sometimes people like to try meat from other places.   - Sometimes restaurants import specific specialty meats, eg wagyu and Kobe beef.   - Sometimes the international product is cheaper, especially close to ports.   - Inefficiency. Some business started importing a foreign product and maintained the contract despite a cheaper domestic alternative. Then suddenly their international partner applied import tariffs causing a rise in nationalism and desire it to stick it to that partner for being a shit, leading to permanent loss of a favorable deal so a small orange man child could have a temporary ego boost.",Zomunieo,2025-04-24T21:31:57,1

And men with hoses squirt kerosene on the oranges, and they are angry at the crime, angry at the people who have come to take the fruit. A million people hungry, needing the fruit- and kerosene sprayed over the golden mountains. And the smell of rot fills the country. Burn coffee for fuel in the ships. Burn corn to keep warm, it makes a hot fire. Dump potatoes in the rivers and place guards along the banks to keep the hungry people from fishing them out. Slaughter the pigs and bury them, and let the putrescence drip down into the earth.  There is a crime here that goes beyond denunciation. There is a sorrow here that weeping cannot symbolize. There is a failure here that topples all our success. The fertile earth, the straight tree rows, the sturdy trunks, and the ripe fruit. And children dying of pellagra must die because a profit cannot be taken from an orange. And coroners must fill in the certificate- died of malnutrition- because the food must rot, must be forced to rot. The people come with nets to fish for potatoes in the river, and the guards hold them back; they come in rattling cars to get the dumped oranges, but the kerosene is sprayed. And they stand still and watch the potatoes float by, listen to the screaming pigs being killed in a ditch and covered with quick-lime, watch the mountains of oranges slop down to a putrefying ooze; and in the eyes of the people there is the failure; and in the eyes of the hungry there is a growing wrath.

"Respectfully, US pork and beef are not ""low quality"".  As someone whose family used to sell to China before Trump messed it up (and I lived in China for a few years), US farm products are sold as premium quality, especially meat and dairy. This is not just because they are higher in cost, but also because consumers are assured of better safety.   Pollution in China is very bad (and regulations lax or unenforced), so consumers there are rightfully concerned about lead and other forms of contamination. Adulteration and substitution is also very common. At least when you buy American beef or pork, it is 100% beef or pork, with no flour or other meat mixed in.   Farmers already sell what we can to Americans. What we sell overseas is whatever is left over, as we produce more than domestic demand or consumption can meet. If we can't sell overseas, we will either have to cut production or the excess will go uneaten and be thrown away.   As for prices, farmers being forced to sell domestically will not significantly lower food costs. Farmers don't set the prices. They get pennies on the dollar for what you pay at the supermarket (about $0.05-0.10 for every $1 of cost) and margins are paper thin & barely break even. It's the middle men, the big corporations, buying up the farm products and then reselling it to the grocery stores, who sell it to the consumer, that set the final price and drive them up.   Trump is a moron because he is forcing farmers into bankruptcy by keeping us from selling excess production overseas at a premium, which allows us to stay in business. His tariffs also raise prices on farm products that we don't even grow in the US, while also raising the cost of inputs like potash that we need to grow food, thereby increasing the cost of food grown domestically. His immigration policies have also led to billions of dollars in food rotting in fields because we don't have anyone to pick it. This also causes prices to rise.",malrexmontresor,2025-04-24T21:39:07,1

"Going to be honest, I thought it sounded a bit high so I started eyeballing it. I'm no fan of Trump economy, but I do believe in From my approximate math and estimates, it'd be disingenuous to say that I could arrive at anything close to a realistic number.. but here's what I did figure out. That's 26.5 million pounds of pork. At 150 pounds of saleable meat per hog, that's 176k processed hogs.  A random large producer I located produced 5 million hogs annually, with 1200 employees & 650 contractors. Another random producer 3.6 million hogs annually with 1000 employees and 1,500 contractors. We don't really know how extensive the contractors operations are, what their nature is, or how many they employ so those numbers are minimally useful. What I did next was look at numbers from a very massive producer & processor/packager and saw hogs per employee as low as 200. Using a 200 hog per employee estimate, we arrive at 880 employees.   But you'd also need to factor in vets, farm hands, pharmaceutical, packaging companies, processing companies, logistics, and all the same for all of their stakeholders (feed mills, someone has to pack/transport the medicine, processing facilities, refrigerated trucking etc.,). Some of that may be included in the 200 hog per employee estimate. It sounds like it could add up quick, but let's take the transportation side of things. 26 million lbs of meet can be moved on 80,000lb semis (331 trips). Hogs themselves also have to be moved, but likely a short distance at 175 semis (1005 trips). And realistically, all of that may only be ~5% of a single massive cargo ship.   >Government website says 537,000 direct and indirect jobs. China imports 9.2% which they just shut down. Direct job loss to the pork industry is estimated at 40,000, include indirect jobs is closer to 55,000  Now let's use this as a check figure. 9.2% of 537,000 is 49,404. But China is only canceling 12,000 tons of 475,000 tons, or 2.5%. If we take 2.5% of 49,404 we arrive at 1,235 jobs. That's pretty darn close to that 880 employee, 200 hog per employee estimate (with some obvious oversight for indirect stakeholders.   But I did say ""it'd be disingenuous to say that I could arrive at anything close to a realistic number."" And regardless of what the number is, it's still very important to the people doing it. Realistically, I think 40,000 is off by *at minimum* factor of 10± and as high as a factor of 20±. If this were *The Price is Right* or a jar of jellybeans and I could not afford to go over, I definitely would not lock in at even 2000-4,000 jobs with what I know. But it's very possible that I could be overlooking some very labor-heavy part of the equation, regardless I'd still rely on that 2.5%. That said, the 40,000+ jobs is still the total pot available if China were to cut all pork imports or continue to moving forward (which I do not know if this is a one-time thing or a long-term reduction that could happen monthly).",postsshortcomments,2025-04-24T23:08:28,1

The US exports oil which can be easily refined by anyone and thus is highly desirable and more expensive.

Thompson, Minnesota’s state veterinarian, said April 30 workers at a JBS plant in Worthington were approaching euthanasia of 3,000 hogs daily and working to increase to 13,000 daily. The plant usually slaughters 20,000 hogs daily but closed April 20, operating with a limited staff to euthanize hogs for farmers, who would be responsible for carcass disposal. The kill portion of the plant reopened on May 6, in response to President Trump’s executive order, to continue to offer pork producers a euthanasia option for hogs they’ve been unable to process as plants have ceased operations.  from Quora: > The answer is a bit complex. Farmers often focus on what they're good at. Let's say raising pigs. They get thousands of pigs in of a certain size and feed them to 275 to 300 pounds and a large buyer takes them and processes them to pork chops, bacon, sausage etc…then takes the now food and packages for grocery stores, restaurants, schools, etc. When the farmer sells that batch of pigs he washes the barn down and brings in another batch of young pigs from a place that specializes in caring for mama and baby pigs. Now…the farmer finds the place taking the pigs for processing won't take them. If they get to big…because they can't just not feed them…they are penalized. So he has pigs backed up looking for a place to send them and they're closed. The pigs have to be USDA processed to sell to grocery stores. You can buy a hog and butcher it at home in your garage but you can't sell someone pork chops from it. The farmer doesn't have 60,000 people able to do that and maybe you don't have the experience to butcher the hog. So he has 60,000 hogs that were scheduled to go…and nowhere to send them. Meanwhile there's a batch of babies that need the space taken up by the bigger hogs. And when that happens the sow farm hurts because they have mama pigs still having babies and running out of room to safely house them…because of the pigs that were suppose to leave for the other farm but now can't. And every animal must be fed and cared for daily. It's six months of expenses and work that they won't get paid for and the bills still need to be paid. They can't just go get a job because they have a job taking care of the farm. The need for volume of bacon and sausage is high and volume keeps prices down. But it needs the processing so you don't have to buy large hogs to butcher in your garage.",Phugasity,2025-04-24T21:51:18,1
