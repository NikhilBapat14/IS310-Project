"At *Defining Ideas*, [David R. Henderson](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/david-r-henderson) makes the case that a “tariff is a tax on imports, and the importer pays almost all of it.” Henderson’s piece comes on the heels of his joining many other prominent economists to sign [a statement](https://anti-tariff.org/) last week “in favor of free trade and against tariffs.” Responding to the claim that tariffs reduce trade deficits, Henderson writes, “If our government imposes tariffs on imports from countries with which we have a large trade deficit, we will buy fewer imports from people in those countries. They will then have fewer dollars to buy our exports. Moreover, some of those countries will retaliate with their own tariffs on our exports.” Henderson also considers the relative burden of tariffs on foreign exporters and domestic importers, citing research from the first Trump administration that found that “importers bore virtually all of the burden.”",HooverInstitution,2025-04-24T15:33:17,17
