Just so folks know... Russia lost this war already. It's second largest bank is collapsing as we speak. Shame our new media does not cover this.,williamgman,2025-04-24T16:47:59,1
That’s because it’s a surrender not a peace proposal.,Ancient_Popcorn,2025-04-24T16:02:36,1

That's the Way (i like it)   DJ and the Shithouse Band,FitWrap1959,2025-04-24T16:08:11,1
Actually that’s incorrect.  Ukraine gets less than nothing in Trumps “winners”….  ….take a number on that one sadly,Tso-su-Mi,2025-04-24T20:05:48,1
That because he is Putins puppet,-Freddybear480,2025-04-24T21:50:18,1
"And then proceeds to say Zelensky is the one being difficult to deal with.  That’s not surprising when he gives one side all that it wants, and forces all concessions from the other side.",Amehoelazeg,2025-04-24T16:05:12,1
Corrupt in what way?,EthicsGradient009,2025-04-24T17:41:46,1
"Johnson has always been pro Ukraine. It’s the one thing I can personally say I feel he got right while in charge.   That said, whenever he had a bad PR day, he always conveniently managed to have someone take a photo of him calling Zelenskyy or flying to Kyiv. Which was frequently.  Sunak tried doing the same but he lacked the charisma. Truss didn’t try it because she can barely navigate her way out of her own house.",TheGardenBlinked,2025-04-24T20:18:59,1
