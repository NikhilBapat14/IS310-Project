"These 6 security guys illegally arrested and detained a private citizen using her first amendment rights, while elected official and Sheriff Bob Norris orchestrated the entire thing. She should have demanded his resignation and that the security team lose their business license.   $5 million to dissolve a shady security business who kidnaps and arrests private citizens feels fair, especially since those security guys didn't go through the approapriate paperwork to be hired or have a contract to be at that town hall. It was almost like they were looking to 'arrest' her or anyone dissenting with their opinion.",Financial-Special766,2025-04-22T22:09:47,40
"She was not ""heckling"". JFC, leave it to WAPO to sensationalize this bullshit.  The guy in MTG's state of Georgia, just uttered ""boo"" at her ""townhall"" and was tazed twice and dragged out...pretty sure he is going to sue as well. Maybe, these idiots need to pay a steep price for violating the 1st Amendment.  Give him 10 million.",pj7140,2025-04-23T00:24:26,30

5m in damages is absolutely obscene. This is something where 10-100k plus legal fees is reasonable.,18212182,2025-04-22T21:59:55,-29

This is the result of comedians bitching about free speech. Now too many think free speech means “I have the mic so you shut your mouth and never question me”,No_Algae1379,2025-04-23T08:40:29,3
"I don't think that it was just 5 million for her removal but also 5 million for the violation of her rights but also as a deterrent for future behavior like this.  And honestly, it makes sense. If a person's human rights are immutable or inherent, then to violate those rights should have huge consequences.  The state and the government should be held to a much higher standard than any civilian.  This should mean that the government should also be punished greater than any civilian because of their higher standards that we expect them to uphold.",Arktikos02,2025-04-22T22:05:31,18
part of the monetary amount is to incentive them not to do it again.  I think it's not enough. If I was the Judge the town would be bankrupt from the amount I hand down. 5 million isn't going to do that.,Soft-Opposite8684,2025-04-23T03:37:09,5

Why shouldn't she? How much are your rights worth to you?  You have to factor in that the people who violated her rights will never face criminal charges for their crimes. That alone should boost the value of the payout 10 times.,Soft-Opposite8684,2025-04-23T03:38:52,6
"Let me put into context how obscene 5 million dollars is: George Floyd's family got 27 million dollars for a brutal murder by a police officer. And your typical wrongful death usually caps out and a few million. The woman received ZERO permanent harm, mental distress, or anything else that could possibly be on the order of millions of dollars.",18212182,2025-04-22T22:27:49,-20
people just don’t understand how punitive damages work,nbphotography87,2025-04-23T05:44:55,3
"Having yourself be forcibly removed from a place you absolutely have a right to be while expressing rights you absolutely have, by people who don’t have the rights to do what they did(they weren’t even licensed to work that event the way they did), and you think there’s no mental distress? You have no idea the value we have on our rights as a society then, or the damage people like these “security guards” can do. This is a dangerous situation that they created. They should absolutely pay. Whatever the settlement ends up being may not be 5 million but suing for less than that would be malpractice when the blatant disregard for constitutional rights and her human rights is so clear here.",RttnAttorney,2025-04-22T22:57:28,22
