Tornado season is now.  Wildfire season starts in May.  Hurricane season starts in June.  This is a RED state BEGGING for federal relief funds.,CouchCorrespondent,2025-04-22T17:17:38,97
"This will come off as callous but it's about damn time that we let the Americans who voted for this clown show to finally have their moment in the spotlight. For decades they have been voting in divisive senators and representatives who have peddled hatred for their fellow countrymen. Now that the foxes are in charge of the hen house, let them burn their hands on the stove. This administration is the amalgamation of Republican pundits, Fox News lies, and general racism. Will there be suffering? Absolutely. But maybe it'll finally force certain Americans to pull their heads out of the sand and start voting for politicians who aren't tribal but instead work *for* the people of this country.",Responsible-Pain-620,2025-04-22T17:45:55,69

This is purely a Trump snub.  He's making America great... for him.        If anyone there has a red hat they should burn it in protest.  It worked for bras and draft cards, it can work for MAGAs.",guttanzer,2025-04-22T18:20:59,15

Loving it. Finally - Republicans can feel their votes and there are no Democrats to rescue them. Nor should they. You have to let the low brow/low IQ FEEL the consequences of their vote. Their willful ignorance.   They were so excited to bring pain and hurt to others. They have relished every horrible thing this administration has done.   Here is your 🪞 - stare deeply at your reflection and realize - all those “others” you have hated and wanted to cause pain - are you. To everyone else - YOU - are the “other”.   Nothing makes me happier than watching people get EXACTLY what they asked for.,ZealousidealShake410,2025-04-22T21:35:26,3
