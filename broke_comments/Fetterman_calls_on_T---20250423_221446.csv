I’m starting to think Fetterman is just Netanyahu standing on John Bolton’s shoulders in a big hoodie.,AaminMarritza,2025-04-23T23:14:36,29

">“You’re never going to be able to negotiate with that kind of regime that has been destabilizing the region for decades already, and now we have an incredible window, I believe, to do that, to strike and destroy Iran’s nuclear facilities,” Fetterman said Wednesday in an interview with the Washington Free Beacon.   Uh huh.  >Fetterman dismissed foreign policy experts who say the U.S. striking Iran would lead to a regional war.  What? I hate this man.",BabyYodaX,2025-04-23T22:15:58,15

Gonna read the comments now.Leave me alone.These comments are gonna destroy Fetterman.Geeeez man.,LycheePrevious7777,2025-04-24T09:41:15,1

He sounds like an angry boomer. But the shorts were always a gimmick. He's a trust fund baby worth millions.,H0bbituary,2025-04-23T22:49:34,9
The man has *always* been a lowkey jackass. Its just that his medical issues gave him an excuse to finally start being completely upfront about it. He's been emboldened by the Republicans to be a piece of shit.,TLKv3,2025-04-23T22:59:46,6
"This feels like a complete 180 from who he was when he was lieutenant governor.  It makes no sense, maybe this is medically related but we couldnt possibly know for sure.  But this is like bizzarely opposite of what he was running as years ago.  Very weird.   ",chipmunksocute,2025-04-23T22:21:08,9

Iran buried their nuclear processing sites deep underground. Israel can't do much in this case without specialized US weapons and bombers.,smersh101,2025-04-23T22:53:17,2

Israel is for Suez. The USA doesn't want it to overextend.,gelatineous,2025-04-23T22:27:42,0
There is no way to bomb your way to preventing Iran getting nukes if they want them.  They could probably build them within weeks and already have delivery systems.  The only way to stop them is to either negotiate or invade.  So are you proposing the US invades Iran ?,awildstoryteller,2025-04-23T22:27:53,10
I'm split. While it's hard to ever want another country to have nukes if Iran did possess some then Israel would be far less likely to act as abhorrently as they are.,Odd-Milk-250,2025-04-23T22:54:59,1
I like that. It's a catchy and accurate way to describe not just Fetterman but anyone who voted for Trump.,Odd-Milk-250,2025-04-23T22:47:23,3
