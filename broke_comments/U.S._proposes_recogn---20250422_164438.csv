Russia has not been asked to make a single concession. A two trillion dollar gas station running on fumes.   Everything is tailored to pressuring Ukraine and the EU to back down.  Feel strong MAGA?,nerphurp,2025-04-22T16:54:22,25

"What a feckless shitstain of a President we elected.  Also, WaPo?  Bezos let you publish this too, eh?  Guess those tariffs must be starting to hit.  I'm sure he can up rates for AWS to compensate.

"Recognising Crimea would help to normalise such expansonist land grabs. Trump would like this as a prelude to annexing Greenland expecting this would help acceptance of that too. Canada beware.  Lifting sactions against Russia would allow it to scale up its war production even more without its economy failing opening the possibility for a later renewed invasion of Ukraine ""to finish the job"". Trump is throwing Ukraine to the Russian wolves.  By starving Ukraine of more military help Trump is actively helping Putin. I felt Biden wanted to send more weapons than he did but the Reps weaponised the issue to damage Biden's election prospects. So Biden had to limit weapons supply to not give the Reps too much ammunition against him. He sent what he could before he left office but after that Trump chose Putin's side and betrayed everything the US and its former allies stood for.  As the Devil's pope on Earth Trump is spreading hate, death and misery wherever he can. USAID's demise is already causing massive starvation in Sudan. The crimes keep coming.",HumanWithComputer,2025-04-22T18:26:13,1

"A lot of them are because they see Russia as a lot stronger than Europe. Why? Because they don't respect any strength but the strength a bully projects. To them you are only as strong as your willingness to threaten and boast about your strength.   Add to that Russia aligns perfectly with their worldview. A hyper-nationalistic state full of bigotry, propaganda, and Christian nationalism.",DisMFer,2025-04-22T16:57:33,8

"But if you keep hitting your head against the wall it will look normal.  Even with all the dead soldiers in the past 4 years included the active army in Europe is bigger, but who needs real numbers when you can include the ""reservists"".  Russia also pretty much made sure it will be doubled to quadrupeled in the coming years.",kaas-schaaf,2025-04-22T17:19:01,5
"Again, you have to think about what they see as ""strong."" To them, stuff like soft power, cultural hegemony or even just economic power are all ""soft"" and ""weak."" All they idolize, and all they think matters, is the ability to threaten and bully people. They see Putin threaten to invade and murder people,e and they see that as him projecting strength.   It's why they see Trump as strong when he yells about making Canada the 51st state. To them, he's showing the world that America can do whatever it wants and no one can stop us.",DisMFer,2025-04-22T17:34:24,5

"Thinking a bully is strong is a mistake. Russia is the bully in this war, and the ‘big dog’ in the fight, which appeals to Trump as he wants to back the “winner”. But their economy is stuffed, riddled with corruption, and the populace is growing increasingly sick of the inconvenience of war. Ukraine is fighting for its very existence, and that’s a fight any country would continue to the death. Putin should remember his lesson about the cornered rat and Trump should chew on that awhile. He’s backing the wrong winner.",ComfortOk9194,2025-04-23T01:03:11,2

"> he's showing the world that America can do whatever it wants and no one can stop us.  The abject lunacy is abound. Agreed.   For example, we've always known the US spends more on defense than almost the rest of the world combined. We know how powerful we are. We didn't need a child swinging a baseball bat in a pottery barn.   We didn't act like 2 year olds previously because that harms us in all manner of other ways that Donald and his ball handlers will never understand, apparently.",socokid,2025-04-23T10:43:47,1
