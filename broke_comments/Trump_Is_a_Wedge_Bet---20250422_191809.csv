"Because the media does a terrible job. Not just right wing media but CNN, MSNBC, and the nighly news don't do nearly a good enough job fact-checking Trump and holding him accountible.   Partially due to fear of retribution.",ColeBeasleyMD,2025-04-22T19:21:34,33
I will never forgive ANYONE for voting for Trump. As far as I‚Äôm concerned anyone who voted for that piece of shit has betrayed the country. Assuming they‚Äôre catastrophically stupid is the kindest possible assumption that can be made.   I will never allow anyone who voted for him into my life beyond absolute necessity. I can offer cool civility in public and nothing more. If you voted Trump you will never have my respect. No exceptions. Including a lot of my family who I will never speak to again.,Darth_Gerg,2025-04-22T19:27:46,22
"At this point, I say there's no making amends with anyone that votes for fascism/literal nazis. Forgiving them would be like forgiving someone that will habitually abuse you to the point of life endangerment. I'm using my estranged mother as an example, she's abusive to the point of having tried to kill me multiple times, I've tried to forgive her, but she doesn't change. The only thing that keeps her at least somewhat normal is having cut her out of my life to let her drown in shame and guilt. It's not perfect, but at least she's not causing problems.  That's what we need to do for anyone that supports racism, sexism, bigotry, hatred, greed, and all the other terrible things that the current administration represents. Redemption is not for them, repent as they will try, they must be given only cold indifference at most.",masterchefguy,2025-04-22T19:49:47,5

"Snippet:  >Sophia, who asked to use a pseudonym to speak candidly about her family‚Äôs situation, says her mother voted for Trump even though she's an immigrant from the Philippines and supports scientific and medical research. ""I don't think she would ever be comfortable to admit that she believed in something that really was completely against her,"" Sophia says.  >While non-white, first-generation immigrant voters¬†[have historically voted Democratic](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/americas-immigrant-voters-and-the-2024-presidential-election/), some have moved right. As was the case among the Black, Arab, and Latino communities overall, the percentage of immigrant and first-generation voters from these groups who swung Republican on the presidential ticket increased in the 2024 election. As Trump's anti-immigrant agenda is put into place, some of their children are wondering how their parents could have supported this candidate ‚Äî and if their relationships can ever recover.  >They find themselves caught up in a swirl of hows and whys.

"No. It‚Äôs because people are filled with hatred.  Let‚Äôs stop pretending that people support Trump because they‚Äôre ill-informed.   People don‚Äôt give two fucks about being informed. They have no interest in critical reasoning, data, evidence etc. Have you ever tried changing someone‚Äôs mind about Trump through fact checking?  People are well fucking aware of who Trump is. There are no excuses anymore.  The sad fact is that roughly 40% of our population is evil. They want to see people in pain. For Trump supporters, that‚Äôs: trans people, minorities, poor people, women, and anyone who isn‚Äôt a white male.  Many immigrants support Trump because they hate trans people, gay people, and women.  Try asking an immigrant Trump supporter what they think about gay or trans people. You think if we were showing them ‚Äúfacts‚Äù on CNN that these people would see the error in their ways and change their hearts and minds?    Because they won‚Äôt.  Because their hearts are black, and they want the people they hate to suffer. Above all.",Disco_Dreamz,2025-04-22T19:47:10,19
"During the campaign period, I posted SO many ""anti-Trump"" articles, as well as the other people who submit articles here and elsewhere.

"What about the people in New York that voted for both AOC and Trump, for instance?   A journalist interviewed some of those voters (mostly women of colour) and they said they voted for Trump because he claimed to be anti-war, his policies would make life more affordable for working people. These are folks who are misinformed partially because the media didn't do a good enough job, imo.   I agree with your sentiment about his base overall but just giving my view on what happened with some swing voters.
