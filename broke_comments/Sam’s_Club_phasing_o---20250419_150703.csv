"I don't remember the last time I used a checkout. I've used the app scan & go function for the last couple years now. Skipped the lines and drawn all kinds of glares from people standing in line like ""why's he just leaving? He didn't pay!!""",ITrCool,2025-04-19T16:19:03,11

"sorry to read this. this only increases the sucking of consumer dollars out of a community, and sending it to stockholders. The benefit of local jobs they provide is lessened as automation takes over.",SerendipitySue,2025-04-19T15:43:58,14
Now if Costco would only adopt new tech. Lines to get out are horrendous at my local Costco.  Edit: oh yeah. I forgot people on Reddit have a Costco fetish. Let me just say it blunt then. Costcoâ€™s 25+ year old technology sucks. Theyâ€™re still using IBM green screen for hells sake.   The checkout experience at Samâ€™s is far superior no matter what the Reddit mob wants to say.,dottedoctet,2025-04-19T15:28:17,6

"Unless this is paired with militant robots who will club petty thieves over the head as they try and abscond with goods, I dare say this will be a mighty contributor to their future shrink woes.  My local BJ's tried to get rid of the person doing the receipt check at the exit a few years back. They reverses that after 30 days or so because people were waltzing out with big screen tv's they grabbed off the rack directly beside where that person used to conduct said checks...",WPWeasel,2025-04-21T13:40:10,1
"I worked there for 7 years and we rolled that app out back in like 2016 or so and I used it ever since.  I really liked it just because it felt like cheating, especially on busy days.  Also I didn't have to give my fellow associates more work so that's a bonus.  It was really unknown for quite a while but now I think it's fairly popular but there's still a lot of people who shop there who won't utilize such things.  Back when I was there I interacted with a lot of local businesses and the constant familiarity with the staff was a big reason why a lot of them liked the place so much.  I had many people when I was a cashier who would only come to my line as I used to work a lot of the early morning shifts which is when a lot of the business members would come in and they would never use the apps or anything.  Getting rid of the face to face interactions I feel like will just hurt them especially when their whole montra was member service when I was there.",ponmbr,2025-04-20T00:18:43,2

"Ok man, good luck in the future. Not gonna argue with someone online over stupid stuff.   But if you think the jobs being sent overseas killed our communities, wait till you see how bad they are after AI takes most.",Rapidfiremma,2025-04-20T19:25:37,2
