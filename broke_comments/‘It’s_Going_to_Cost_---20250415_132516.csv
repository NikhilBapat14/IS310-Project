"What kills me about these people, if it had happened to someone else, like say a Lib, he'd have no problem, as long as it didn't affect him.  I'm sure he's not worrying about the people unlawfully taken to a prison in El Salvador.  I have no pity for these people.  Trump SAID he was going to impose tariffs and cut government spending.
