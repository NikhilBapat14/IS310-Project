"Because the majority of national Democratic candidates do not do a very good job of connecting with voters on an emotional or personal level. On a local level, they do amazing. But they move onto a national stage, and they tend to fall flat.  We saw a lot of that in the last election, where the Democrats were putting out a lot of truthful charts and information about inflation (globally) coming down, and wages (on average) going up, but those charts and the narrative was very high-level, and stuck to national averages. They did very little to connect with the average person whose grocery bill was still high or the near-minimum wage workers barely scraping by. To sum it up, they have a disconnect with the average person.  This is the #1 lesson future Democratic candidates need to learn moving forward.
