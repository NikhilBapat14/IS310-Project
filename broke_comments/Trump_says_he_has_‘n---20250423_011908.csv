So he‚Äôs definitely firing Powell. Got it.,ApplicationAfraid334,2025-04-23T01:19:47,30
"President Trump said he had ‚Äúno intention of firing‚Äù Jerome Powell after his criticism of the US Federal Reserve chairman led to a sharp sell-off in American shares and the dollar.  He said in a news conference on Tuesday that he wanted Powell to be ‚Äúa little more active in terms of his idea to lower interest rates‚Äù.  Last Thursday, Trump said the¬†‚Äútermination‚Äù of Powell¬†as Federal Reserve chairman ‚Äúcannot come fast enough‚Äù after Powell raised concerns about the impact of tariffs on the US economy.  The president renewed his attack on his social media platform Truth Social on Monday, calling Powell ‚ÄúTOO LATE AND WRONG‚Äù and¬†demanding immediate interest rate cuts. This triggered a market sell-off on Monday that left all three¬†main equity indices down more than 2%",TimesandSundayTimes,2025-04-23T01:19:46,10
