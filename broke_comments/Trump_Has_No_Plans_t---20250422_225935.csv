I mean its pretty obvious that Trump dose not like the FED. He complained out them his first term and probably will continue this term.   I think first term he wanted them to increase interest rates since the economy was doing good pre-Covid and now its the opposite.,red-african-swallow,2025-04-23T07:30:50,-6
If the Fed Reserve was not a private entity with a monopoly on our money he could.  Audit the fed. End the fed. Prosecute the fed.,HastingsIV,2025-04-23T01:18:54,-131
"Trump said if he asked him to leave, he would.   It’s a basic inference from that statement that Trump has not yet asked him to step down. He simply wants Powell to lower rates because it’s good for the economy.",dunkeater,2025-04-22T23:02:17,-123

"Lower rates now is a bad idea. It was back in 2024 when the fed did during an election year to boost democrats. However, it is still a bad year. Also, Powell doesn't make these decisions 100% on his own",MoisterOyster19,2025-04-23T03:12:08,46
It would be good for the debt restructuring in June. But I don’t want Powell gone before his term is up.,Acceptable_Travel_20,2025-04-22T23:34:35,5
"It would be good for mortgage rates, business loans, credit card payments, and the national debt.  In a growing economy, low rates are a massive boon and production increases fast enough to stifle inflation.",dunkeater,2025-04-22T23:41:56,-57
"A low interest rate also means inflation, no one wants that.",The_Asian_Viper,2025-04-23T06:58:28,27
$6.5 trillion gets restructured in June. Anything else is a rounding error. We’ll see how this goes…..,Acceptable_Travel_20,2025-04-22T23:50:35,-2
A 1% decrease in interest on 6.5 trillion is 65 billion. A growing economy will add $1 trillion or more each year.,dunkeater,2025-04-22T23:53:17,-19
"Totally agree but I see the world economy slowing a little bit. Not to any of the catastrophic models, but definitely slowing a bit.",Acceptable_Travel_20,2025-04-22T23:56:18,-5
"Possibly, but my hunch is that some countries will do very well while others will struggle.   If the U.S. economy booms over the next 2-4 years, as I think it will, it will drag up the countries we do the most business with. The ones left behind (especially China) are going to contract.",dunkeater,2025-04-22T23:59:08,-4
"I don’t disagree with the plan.  Restructure low, tax cut, off to the races again in 2026. Risky as hell though. As I said, we will see how this all plays out. I hope and plan on it working out.",Acceptable_Travel_20,2025-04-23T00:05:00,2
