"A federal judge temporarily blocked election officials Thursday from implementing parts of President Donald Trump’s executive order to require people to prove they are citizens when they fill out federal voter registration forms.  The [sweeping order Trump signed last month](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/25/trump-elections-citizenship-proof/) sought to overhaul how the 2026 midterm elections are run, even though the Constitution says voting policies are to be set by the states and Congress. Democrats and voting rights groups [quickly sued](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/31/democrats-trump-lawsuit-election-executive-order/), leading to Thursday’s preliminary injunction.  “Our Constitution entrusts Congress and the States — not the President — with the authority to regulate federal elections,” U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly wrote in her opinion.   Under the ruling, the independent, bipartisan Election Assistance Commission is barred for now from changing the federal voter registration form to require people to provide passports or other documents proving their citizenship to get on the voter rolls. The order also prevents federal agencies from implementing a part of the order that tells them to determine whether people are citizens before providing them a copy of the registration form.
