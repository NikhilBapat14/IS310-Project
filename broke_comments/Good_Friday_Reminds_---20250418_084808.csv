"For something not normal, it sure seems to happen a lot.  I don't buy into flights of fantasy, you shouldn't either; everybody dies....even Jesus did.",letmeinfornow,2025-04-18T08:57:58,48

"While I agree a lot with your posts, this comment is way off base in my opinion.    This is not the Federal Government in session. AND Freedom of Religion is, whether you like it or not, a very political topic.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-18T10:40:35,8
"Separation of Church and State was made to keep the State out of the Church, not the Church out of the State. Our country was founded on Biblical principles.",Creepy-Nectarine-225,2025-04-18T10:29:54,2

Yes.   The principle is the government should neither impose an official religion (eg:  The Church of England) nor interfere with the free exercise of religion.  The founders were very religious folks.,SonnyC_50,2025-04-18T11:18:27,5

"Yes and unlike people right here in this sub they didn‚Äôt look to their religion to legislate, and they removed any sponsorship of religion from the reach of the federal government.  And for good reason. My fellow Christians who try to shove religion into politics are always the least bright. Because whenever you think of politics being inclusive of religious ideals it‚Äôs ALWAYS Christianity. You wanna open the door for sharia law to be codified into law?? Didn‚Äôt think so.",Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-04-18T12:52:58,7
You also realize you just agreed with creepy nectarine then gave a response that agrees with what I‚Äôm saying right? Religion free of politics AND politics free of religion.,Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-04-18T12:54:12,5
"I am in no way saying I‚Äôm more special than anyone, quite the contrary, I am not special at all. As for all of those things you listed, they all came into the world through sin. They are not from God.",Creepy-Nectarine-225,2025-04-18T10:41:02,8
"If god is showing up in your life, you are very special.  Do you see him on your toast or in the frost on your windshield?  Does he talk to you?  Flames from your hair?  Speaking in tongues?",letmeinfornow,2025-04-18T11:41:49,1
"I understand you‚Äôre being a smartass. But some of the ways He‚Äôs made Himself known to me are this: The day after my wife and I found out she‚Äôs pregnant, we went to Church. ‚ÄúCoincidentally‚Äù, the Pastor‚Äôs message that day was about being pregnant. That gave us peace that only He could provide at a time that we had no idea what to do.   Another time, it was the first time I ever gave money to the Church, I was very against it. The next day while I was at work, this couple my same age came in and would not stop talking to me about Jesus. How He‚Äôs worked in their lives and how He has blessed them ever since they started tithing. I closed that deal and made over $1000 in commission. ‚ÄúCoincidentally‚Äù a huge blessing for my family the day after I gave to the Church.   Another time, at Church the Pastor was talking about how he had received random checks in the mail that helped him get by in times of need. I said a prayer to God and called bullshit on it. I said, ‚ÄúGod I‚Äôm sorry but I just don‚Äôt believe this guy. That you were sending him money in the mail to make ends meet? I‚Äôve never gotten a check in the mail that I wasn‚Äôt expecting.‚Äù That was on Sunday. On Tuesday that next week I received a check in the mail from an overpayment on a medical bill. What a ‚Äúcoincidence‚Äù but I know it was God showing me that He can do anything.  I have countless more examples of ‚Äúcoincidences‚Äù like that. I‚Äôm not saying God appears to me in a vision, as a person, on toast, etc. These ‚Äúcoincidences‚Äù are God moving in my life and making Himself known to me in a way that only He can.   I would just encourage you to be open and pray to Him. Ask Him to make Himself known to you. Have a blessed day brother.",Creepy-Nectarine-225,2025-04-18T12:00:22,8
So....the same as seeing jesus on a burnt piece of bread...you saw what you wanted to see.  Maybe god could spend more time focused on babies dying for no reason instead of you.,letmeinfornow,2025-04-18T12:11:32,11
