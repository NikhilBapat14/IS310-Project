"The idea behind the ID verification is so that only adults (who'd have a state issued ID, typically a drivers license) would be able to access the sites. Sites like pornhub have just blocked access from states who have these ID laws in place so they don't have to deal with developing/ paying for the software/services of one of these ID verification companies.  For the automod: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_verification_service",Lopsided_Republic888,2024-12-24T07:28:55,7
This is an opinion question. What source could someone provide?,Yangervis,2024-12-23T13:00:02,0
I understand the idea behind it but I don’t think any kind of content on internet should be essentially censored behind an ID Wall. Seems like a slippery slope and could be a way to squeeze in additional legislation for other products like a rated M games for example. I know this post is opinionated but it seems like no one is talking about how serious something as simple as ID verification could be a breach of someone’s privacy. Like would the ID documents uploaded be encrypted? Is that stated in the law too?,Apeist,2024-12-24T08:10:50,4
"I couldn't say whether the laws requiring ID verification say anything about the security of the IDs. However, I may be incorrect, and I'm not gonna pore over the legislation, which would probably be thousands of pages in total. I didn't address this in my original comment, but Porhub (and others) tried to fight against the laws and have just refused to allow devices from those states to access the site(s) due to them not being willing to take the risk of a breach in their sites, and them not willing to spend money on the services which would allow them to do ID verification.  I think that the ID verification laws are absurd, pointless, and a bit of government overreach (and abuse of power), but what pornhub and others are doing is the right thing for them and their users.",Lopsided_Republic888,2024-12-24T08:23:11,4
I agree. The companies have to adapt and I don’t think the laws make much sense either. Kids will always find a way to access whatever they want.,Apeist,2024-12-24T09:24:52,3
"Anyone with a VPN can get around the location specific ""bans"". On their face, the laws make sense, but overall, it's just the religious right trying to force their morals on people.",Lopsided_Republic888,2024-12-24T09:30:55,5
