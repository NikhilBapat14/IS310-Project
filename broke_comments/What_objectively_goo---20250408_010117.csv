Doesn’t really make sense since he wants to increase the military budget to a trillion. (A 200 billion dollar per year increase).   If he wanted to save money there and spend it somewhere else (tax cuts on the middle class for example) that would be a great thing.   But getting them to spend more while also having us spend even more just has everyone spending a shit ton on the military.,The-Mandalorian,2025-04-09T14:48:39,14

"> Gotten the rest of Nato Countries to spend more money on there military  Trump wasn't responsible for that.

That doesn't make any sense. Are you under the impression that we only spend a ton on our military because other countries don't spend enough and we feel some obligation to protect them? Because that isn't the case. Our high military spending is for our own benefit and nobody else's.

It helped more with Trump being in office and Nato countries understanding he isn't reliable ally.  I don't expect us to reduce spending even though I think we should.

"No, Trump was responsible however for them to understand they can't rely on us for there own safety.  I would rather that not be the case.  But it is what it is.  Secondly you are under the wrong impression here that I expect us to stop the amount of spending.  I doubt that happens.  I would HOPE it would happen if Europe is taking more of the load for there own security since we are losing softpower influence.  But I doubt that also.  What I hope happens and what I expect to happen are different things.",Wermys,2025-04-09T14:55:22,1
I know that.  Softpower was what it was about.  But that is truly binned now and probably for the next decade.  There literally is no reason to have as large an army as we do now because of the moves he has done.   And that money could be spent on the Navy.  But anyways that isn't going to happen until Democrats are in power.  But they will first try to repair the softpower we lost which as I said will take at least a decade to get back.  Anyways fuck Trump but as I said it was the 1 good thing at least was getting Europe to shoulder more of the load.  But dividends from that won't happen until after Trump leaves office.,Wermys,2025-04-09T15:16:56,3

"You think 100% of the migrants who came in under Biden are building houses?   100s of thousands of them went to NYC, Chicago, and SF where the use builds the fewest units of housing.  and where they got free housing (hotels & apartments) and other hand outs.",discourse_friendly,2025-04-09T19:30:36,2

"You've nailed it there; Trump and Putin have both in their ways helped the increased military spending of EU NATO countries. Putin by being the bad guy looming on the horizon and Trump by making the normal US support unreliable.   Either of those reasons above wouldn't have likely seen that result. As a former military man, I can REALLY get behind NATO countries tossing more into their militaries.

Ah this canard. That limit was when the president was required to shut down the border. The bill also gave the president the authority to do it earlier which Biden promised to use. It also codified remain in Mexico. And sped up deportations by hiring more ice and border patrol agents and most importantly expanding the number of immigration judges you know the people who give you due process. Not to mention allowing asylum seekers work permits so they wouldn’t be on the tax payers dime.
