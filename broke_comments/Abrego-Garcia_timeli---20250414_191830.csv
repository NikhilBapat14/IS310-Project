"Unless Mr. Garcia is released from the El Salvador CECOT gulag, the United States is now officially a police state. Any ""enemy"" of Donald Trump can be deported to this horrific torture prison, and the Trump administration will claim that the US government is powerless to bring that person back; obviously a boldfaced lie since the US sent the person there. But Trump doesn't care about the truth or justice, he lives for hatred, cruelty, vindictiveness, ""winning,"" and bullying to obscure his impotence.",Nerd-19958,2025-04-14T19:32:42,41
"how easy would it have been for El Salvador president to give him back make trump look like the law and order president. Instead, trump tries to flip the SCOTUS decision and look like trump is  so weak he can't negotiate a deal. the reality is Garcia is dead and trump is trying to keep it secret because when it leaks out what really happened he's going to get impeached for the 3rd time.",Civil_Exchange1271,2025-04-14T19:42:43,15
"Something we need to keep in mind. Abrego is the only clerical error **the administration has admitted to but certainly not the only clerical error made.** Here are a couple of examples: ICE copy pasted another person's information into man's file, man deported for having a soccer tattoo honoring Real Madrid, man deported for autism awareness tattoo.... There are definitely endless stories like this.  https://immigrationimpact.com/2025/04/03/men-deported-el-salvador-stories-investigation/  Here's a case of another man wrongly sent with papers signed by a fired crooked cop who now works for the outsourced detention centers: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2025/04/10/fired-milwaukee-police-officer-report-gay-stylist-salvadoran-prison/83005721007/  So please keep in mind this is about far more people than just Abrego. Him alone coming home (if he does) is not a win. It's simply Trump holding off being pulled out of power for one more day. Of course him getting released and brought back to the US would be fantastic, but these are basically POWs of war that we cannot forget about until they all come home.   Which also means we've reached authoritarian disappearing people levels. And quite possibly, depending what happens, death squad levels.",undercurrents,2025-04-14T23:23:37,9
"I honestly do not care if the man murdered babies (okay wait for me to finish) - if he was a criminal, charge him with a crime and figure it out in court. Even the most heinous criminals deserve due process.",Blecki,2025-04-14T22:25:22,5
