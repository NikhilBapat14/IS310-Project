Executive orders are bogus.  Congress needs to act. This is their job.  Not the presidents.  It‚Äôs his job to put the final signature on bills. Not the first.,Top-Ad-5245,2025-04-24T05:42:12,3

"   1. Powerful, often exclusionary, populist nationalism centered on cult of a redemptive, ‚Äúinfallible‚Äù leader who never admits mistakes. * 2. Political power derived from questioning reality, endorsing myth and rage, and promoting lies. * 3. Fixation with perceived national decline, humiliation, or victimhood. * 4. White Replacement ‚ÄúTheory‚Äù used to show that democratic ideals of freedom and equality are a threat. Oppose any initiatives or institutions that are racially, ethnically, or religiously harmonious. * 5. Disdain for human rights while seeking purity and cleansing for those they define as part of the nation. * 6. Identification of ‚Äúenemies‚Äù/scapegoats as a unifying cause. Imprison and/or murder opposition and minority group leaders. * 7. Supremacy of the military and embrace of paramilitarism in an uneasy, but effective collaboration with traditional elites. Fascists arm people and justify and glorify violence as ‚Äúredemptive‚Äù. * 8. Rampant sexism. * 9. Control of mass media and undermining ‚Äútruth‚Äù. * 10. Obsession with national security, crime and punishment, and fostering a sense of the nation under attack. * 11. Religion and government are intertwined. * **12. Corporate power is protected and labor power is suppressed.** * 13. Disdain for intellectuals and the arts not aligned with the fascist narrative. * 14. Rampant cronyism and corruption. Loyalty to the leader is paramount and often more important than competence. * 15. Fraudulent elections and creation of a one-party state. * 16. Often seeking to expand territory through armed conflict.

Because fascists give certain business owners money and protect their interests when they're in power, and the people running those companies know this fact. That's it, some of them will make more money",ExternalSize2247,2025-04-23T23:53:39,15

"The government has nothing at all to do with accreditation of colleges and universities. Like they're not involved at all. This EO does nothing, it's just something to stir shit up in the media.  The president can issue an EO saying Harvard is no longer accredited, but he's not the one who makes that call - it's other universities. And no other university is going to refuse to accept transfer credits from Harvard, no companies will refuse to accept Harvard degrees as valid, no students will decide not to apply to Harvard.",mediocre_remnants,2025-04-24T15:58:59,1
