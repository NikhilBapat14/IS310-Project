"Until someone stops pussyfooting around this war will be continue to be a long drawn out conflict likely resulting in all of Ukraine being absorbed into Russia.   Either the U.S. accepts that a dictator will eventually take over an entire country. Or the U.S. supplies Ukraine sufficient to stop Russia and push them to a stalemate on reasonable (who knows what’s actually reasonable) borders.   Zelensky isn’t wrong in his assumption that any peace agreement that doesn’t involve security guarantees is just pushing Ukraine’s death out a few more years. Under Putin, and likely any Putin successor, Ukraine will always be viewed as Russia’s and a place to someday be taken back.   Land concessions now will really only work if in return Ukraine is able to arm and protect themselves sufficient to stop any future invasion. I don’t know why any leader would give up territory now on the promise that Russia won’t do it again.",EliteJassassin101,2025-04-24T11:21:39,1007

Many hoped that Trumps presidency would end Biden's drop by drop approach and threaten or enforce decisive Ukraine aid and sanctions unless Putin accepted a ceasefire that included security guarantees for Ukraine, restitution of kidnapped children, stopping arms transfer with NK and Iran and some other demands.   Instead as of now the only thing that has been achieved is increasing Russian recruitment through constant talk of as of now ireallizable peace.   Strength throug peace should be more then words, and we are currently following the completly opposite course, ""peace"" through strategic surrender.

"Making a lasting peace is an incredibly difficult endevour, i won't sugarcoat it, you must find troops from a strong guarantor that guard the contact line, have both sides give up their maximalist demands, you have to send excellent negotiations who know how to avoid being snared by the negotiating party, you have to take into account other countries situation in the matter ecc ecc     The problem is that Trump's actions so far has been pressuring Ukraine to concede a lot while ignoring the most problematic side of the equation, namely Russia. And it's a plan far worse then any of those proposed by Trumps own advisors like Rubio or good foreign policy analysts.     From stating that he won't send more aid to Ukraine, to refusing NATO as a possibility the US gave up A LOT of leverage over both Russia and Ukraine (more difficult to credibly threaten Russia to increase aid if you say you won't send any at all)   To not making negotiations with EU, Ukraine and US on one side to increase total leverage instead of negotiations between only US and Russia.    To sending Wittkoff inexperienced in this type of negotiations that simply comes back with Russian propagand and zero achievments the progress on negotiations has been negative, with Russia emboldened, Ukraine untrustful of US intentions and Europe trying to understand what the endgoal of the US is (it has increased EU support for Ukraine though, i will gladly give him that point)  It's not that the process isn't extremly difficult, but it's that it's being done really badly. I can applaude Trump for trying his best, but this is the biggest western war in Europe since WW2 and Trumps foreign policy cabinet, with the partial exception of Kellog and Rubio is filled with peoples whose competence is more and more dubious or even have conflict of interests in Russia while he himself clearly doesn't have the time and energy to properly understand the situation.      No president has to be good with everything, Trump is much better in internal policies like immigration, but he needs to listen to people such as analysts who while annoying comprehend the situation better.   have a good day.",Outside_Ad_3888,2025-04-24T15:25:44,18
