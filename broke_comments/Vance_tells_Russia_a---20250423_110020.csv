So the grand strategy is fail and then quit. Very stable genius.,InternationalArt1897,2025-04-23T11:03:14,41
Just send him to meet Putin and the JD Vance Curse will take care of everything ,hey-coffee-eyes,2025-04-23T11:03:18,17
"Honestly, at this rate, it's probably better for Ukraine if the US wasn't involved. The current administration is always going to favor Russia, so if we left, it would give Europe more power to let Ukraine take the gloves off finally.",Kindly_Ice1745,2025-04-23T11:10:00,12
Which is exactly what Putin wants.,BrutalHunny,2025-04-23T11:05:35,8
I thought trump was going to solve this on day 1? Why does Ukraine care what we say? We aren't doing anything to help them now anyway. Toothless threat.,Kroe,2025-04-23T11:06:24,8
It's almost like trump had no real plan on this one.  Good thing the cult never holds him accountable.,yrotsihfoedisgnorw,2025-04-23T11:07:56,4
"Is there a downside for Ukraine if America walks away?  Europe seems poised to step in.  The whole world knows America can’t be relied on anymore.  Even if we don’t officially walk away, actual aid will probably all but stop, current authorized aid is about exhausted and paltry compared to Biden aid levels.  Trump thinks ending the war on Putin’s terms guarantees him a Noble Peace Prize, which is all he cares about.",KidKilobyte,2025-04-23T11:13:23,5
"Russia doesn't want peace.  If there is a peace, Russian soldiers will return home to nothing.  Then they will start a war at home.  Good luck, Putin!",HeHateMe337,2025-04-23T11:09:55,3

With Vance’s track record he should pay Putin a visit.,AcidRohnin,2025-04-23T11:10:17,2
We walked when trump got elected.,CurrentlyLucid,2025-04-23T11:21:45,2

For some reason I don't think anyone else sees this as the threat that Vance thinks it is.,Birdius,2025-04-23T11:19:05,1
I don't remember Trump saying I will end this war in one day or walk away after 100 days.,Immediate_Weird5254,2025-04-23T11:21:10,1
Bye bye,thomas_brock13190,2025-04-23T11:21:23,1

"""Walk away"" is simply shorthand for ""Hand Ukraine over to Russia"".",crazybones,2025-04-23T11:43:18,1
Gosh Trump is the best negotiator ever. What a beautiful deal.,aaaaron87,2025-04-23T11:44:21,1

Translation: Vance tells Ukraine to give Russia everything Russia wants or the US will give Russia everything Russia wants.,CJ4ROCKET,2025-04-23T13:03:51,1
Glad my grandpa is dead. American men as leaders have proved themselves to be worse than the one before. History means nothing to those that are stupid enough to not take it as a blueprint for the future.,DowntimeJEM,2025-04-23T13:20:38,1
To “walk away” is to cede US support and this vastly strengthen Russia’s position. How could he be stupid enough to think that’s a legitimate ultimatum? It’s in Russia’s interests to not accept.,finallytisdone,2025-04-23T13:26:00,1
Always the plan.,orcinyadders,2025-04-23T14:17:46,1
The best way to get the US out of the way is to make it their idea.  Nice work Putin.,AcanthisittaNo6653,2025-04-23T15:24:10,1

This is fucking hilarious,JIMMY_RUSTLING_9000,2025-04-23T11:25:55,2
Is it? Russia wasn’t doing so hot having to use donkeys and shit. This was their path to victory. It’s a hollow threat,ArtVandelay32,2025-04-23T12:56:22,2
He has a plan. Whatever Vladimir told him is the plan.,neutrino71,2025-04-23T12:54:00,1
"Absolutely. The USA is still providing a lot of weapons and will likely stop doing that completely (including spares for gear already delivered) and on top of that they will probably try to relieve sanctions on Russia to funnel money to Putin. They are trying really, really hard to make Ukraine lose their territory for good. Europe has some very tough choices to make.",HorrorStudio8618,2025-04-23T12:17:29,2
Russia would start to build out crimea and run their Paul and natural gas pipelines to the ports.  Huge money,RobbyRock75,2025-04-23T12:34:38,2

If US “walks away” that means no support for Ukraine. Russia can then just roll right over them.,BrutalHunny,2025-04-23T12:57:40,1
With what?,ArtVandelay32,2025-04-23T13:47:19,2
"the weapons and equipment the US will sell them and the income from the sanctions the US will lift from them. they've been trying very hard to set up this scenario but the natural opportunity has not presented itself yet where it will be ""acceptable"" from a ratings perspective. eventually they'll say fuck the ratings, they're already in the gutter and do it anyways.",random-user-8938,2025-04-23T14:22:15,1
