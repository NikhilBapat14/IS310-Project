They never said anything like this about the American hostages taken by Palestinians. They hate citizens.,kaytin911,2025-04-17T05:36:07,288
"On one hand I get it. ¬†The leftist supreme judges who said if this could happen to him it could happen to anyone.  On the other, this guy is literally a citizen of El Salvador. ¬†He holds nothing more than a judges order saying he can be in the United States, but once he‚Äôs back in El Salvador he‚Äôs at their mercy.  We‚Äôre not talking about a US citizen, and the more we learn about this guy the more I wonder why he‚Äôs getting all the special treatment.",j3remy2007,2025-04-17T05:31:21,268
They won‚Äôt stand for Laken Riley but they‚Äôll fly to El Salvador to free a non-citizen who‚Äôs been credibly accused of being a terrorist.,UltraAirWolf,2025-04-17T07:09:00,128
"They‚Äôre creating such an awesome party platform for themselves.

"Baltimore looks like a post-apocalyptic city straight out of The Walking Dead, and this idiot‚Äôs in a foreign country trying to convince them to show him some random citizen of El Salvador with no connection to the US.

"It's actually ironic because nobody knew who this guy was until the leftist media latched onto this administrative error and broadcasted his name and location. But now because his name is being announced to the world, I'm sure there's some gang members in El Salvador that remember him and now know where to find him. If he gets killed it's because the media forcefully made him a martyr without his consent.",specter491,2025-04-17T09:02:05,34

"Look, I understand the public policy reasons for why he should and should not be returned. Legally, however, I think the administration is wrong.   While they are correct that the court does not have jurisdiction over a citizen of El Salvador in El Salvador, I think the real issue is who are the parties to the case. In this case, the parties include the U.S. Government, who the court **does** have jurisdiction over.   While the court cannot order Garcia to return or El Salvador to release him, it can order the U.S. Government, as a party in the case over which the court has jurisdiction, to expedite his return to the U.S., since the U.S. is the party who deported him to a prison which the U.S. contracts with to maintain him in.  Whether we need to change our immigration laws to make them stricter or create forms of expedited deportations is beyond the scope of this comment.",Cestavec,2025-04-17T10:12:24,44

"It's amazing how much the left loves criminals. There are plenty of people out there who have gotten screwed over by system, persecuted, or murdered, and yet there's always crickets from the left. But as soon as a criminal is involved in a situation where he may or may not had his rights violated, suddenly he's treated like a saint. They show him in his graduation gown, or playing with his kids, and he's always smiling. They always leave out the part where he has a long list of felony convictions and that the reason he was involved in the whole situation is because he was doing something illegal.",Antisocial_Worker7,2025-04-17T10:40:26,9
"As this man had a judge who had granted him sanctuary and was deported without proper due process, I think Sen. Van Holen is correct. We must remain the party of law and order. We want to deal with illegal immigration; we need to do things by the book and not create the dangerous precedent we are playing with here.",Twogunkid,2025-04-17T07:28:54,36

Send him from El Salvador to anywhere but America. Then country that receives him gives him a cot and a hot. Then country sends a citizen of El Salvador back to El Salvador. Problem solved. All parties are happy.,Long_Jelly_9557,2025-04-18T07:55:14,1
The truth is that El Salvador is now a safe and stable country.  Safer in fact than the US.  He risks very little of his actual person to try and talk to Bukele.,MexusRex,2025-04-17T07:54:53,50
"As I understand things, the order doesn‚Äôt say he can be in the US, it says he can‚Äôt be deported to El Salvador (unless I‚Äôm getting this guy confused with some other guy). In fact, there‚Äôs another order that says he can‚Äôt be in the US. The logic dictates that he can‚Äôt be sent to El Salvador but he can‚Äôt stay here. It‚Äôs basically a judicial order version of Closing Time: ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have to go home but you can‚Äôt stay here‚Äù.",deadzip10,2025-04-17T07:51:16,53

"The optics are even worse than that right now.  Literally this week, an illegal was found guilty of the attack and murder of Rachel Morin, a Maryland mother who was assaulted while jogging.  She's literally a constituent of this Senator, and he's apparently ignored the case.

"A lot of Democrats haven't internalized the implications of Hispanic support collapse yet. They really think that Hispanic American citizens feel kinship with illegal immigrant gang members.  Texas was ""supposed"" to be blue now because of demographic change, but it went much deeper red in 2024 despite heavier anti-illegal immigration rhetoric from Trump. He didn't even stop at ""illegal"", it was clearly also a reduced legal migration platform this time around.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-17T08:15:06,24
