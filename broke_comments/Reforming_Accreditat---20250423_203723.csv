"Hitler’s Attack on German Universities.  A Systematic Destruction of Intellectual Freedom:  Key Actions:  	1.	Purging of “Non-Aryan” and Oppositional Faculty (1933):  	•	The Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service expelled Jewish professors, political dissenters, and anyone deemed “unreliable.”  	•	Germany lost a generation of intellectual giants—especially in physics, philosophy, law, and medicine.  	•	Notable exiles: Albert Einstein, Erwin Schrödinger, Hannah Arendt.   	2.	Ideological Indoctrination:  	•	Universities became tools of Nazi propaganda.  	•	Fields like history, law, and biology were twisted to support racial theories and nationalist myths.  	•	Independent research was replaced by “German Science” (Deutsche Physik), rejecting “Jewish science” like relativity.   	3.	Book Burnings (May 1933):  	•	Led by Nazi student groups and supported by professors.  	•	Thousands of works by Jewish, Marxist, liberal, and pacifist authors burned in symbolic rejection of free thought.   	4.	Curriculum Control:  	•	Courses infused with racial ideology, anti-Semitism, and Führer-worship.  	•	Academic merit was replaced by political loyalty.  	•	Disciplines not easily aligned with Nazi ideology were marginalized.   	5.	Decline of Scientific Leadership:  	•	Germany, once the world leader in science and philosophy, saw a catastrophic intellectual collapse. 	•	Brain drain fueled scientific advancements in the US and UK—ironically contributing to Allied victory (e.g., Manhattan Project).",Kokophelli,2025-04-23T20:41:44,53

">people calling Trump Nazi because he deported MS13 members to CECOT, as if saying it is the same thing as Nazis putting Jews in concentration camps   Yeah, sure, Trump deporting hundreds of 'undesirables' to foreign prison camps with no due process is nothing like what the Nazis did to Jewish people at all.  Except:  >Until this point, Hitler had been reluctant to **deport Jews in the German Reich** until the war was over because of a fear of resistance and retaliation from the German population. But, in the autumn of 1941, key Nazi figures contributed to mounting pressure on Hitler to **deport the German Jews.** This pressure culminated in Hitler ordering **the deportation of all Jews** still in the Greater German Reich and Protectorate between 15-17 September 1941.  [https://www.theholocaustexplained.org/how-and-why/how/deportation-of-german-jews-september-1941/](https://www.theholocaustexplained.org/how-and-why/how/deportation-of-german-jews-september-1941/)  The deportations are the first half of the process, which you would know if you weren't historically illiterate.
