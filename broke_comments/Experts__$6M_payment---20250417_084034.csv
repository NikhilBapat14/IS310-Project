US tax dollars should never fund concentration like camps. We have to stand up by exempting federal tax withholdings. We will not pay the government to harm human beings.,Lebarican22,2025-04-17T08:41:34,71

Why didn‚Äôt he send the 6M to private prisons for detention who employ Americans? America First I thought? Oh that‚Äôs right he just wants the deportation ‚Äúnumbers‚Äù and the photo op of being tough on illegal immigration.,perilous_times,2025-04-17T09:56:57,25

I URGE everyone to consider exempting on federal taxes or increasing your dependents. We must not allow this government to use OUR money to support concentration camps and illegal abductions of humans. We MUST make a stance.¬†,Lebarican22,2025-04-18T11:06:42,1

The point was to get them off US soil and out of the jurisdiction of US courts. This is even worse in some ways than concentration camps. A concentration camp in America would have a greater possibility of someone stepping in.,newbie527,2025-04-17T10:50:50,13
