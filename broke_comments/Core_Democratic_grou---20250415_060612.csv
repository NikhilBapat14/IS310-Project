">Musk, backed by several Republican members of Congress, has also called on the FBI to investigate ActBlue, alleging that the Democratic Party’s main fundraising platform has skirted campaign finance laws and allowed foreign nationals to make illegal contributions to Democratic candidates.  Irony is dead.",srone,2025-04-15T06:43:55,88
"More Right-wing nonsense.  When they do it, no big deal and 'freedom'.  When lefties do the same thing it's a crime.    Musk in particular is worried that if Dems win big there would be an investigation into him, DOGE, conflicts of interests, etc.  As the WH press security said -- if he is innocent, then nothing to worry about.   For the Congressional Republicans, some are safe in the mid terms and beyond, but they are probably aware of the risks of the losing the House and maybe picking up a few seats in the Senate (flipping the Senate will be hard).   For Trump, it is simply a personal vendetta.",crucial_geek,2025-04-15T08:39:29,32
What the fuck is wrong with Republicans that they just stand idly by and watch the fabric of our country torn to shreds? I truly can’t fathom hating others so much.,YurtMcnurty,2025-04-15T14:06:11,6
Good thing he's not using the DOJ to go after his political enemies. That would be hypocritical.,swordrat720,2025-04-15T09:15:14,10

"There were several quotes in that article that clearly indicate, that ALL of this is about Trump getting ""revenge"" on all who brought charges against him and rightfully convicted him in a court of law. Some sycophant in there even stated that all of this is to ensure that Trump's enemies learn a lesson and never attempt to prosecute Republican criminal activities again. ",LivingIndependence,2025-04-15T13:44:59,3
If democrats win the house it’s because it’s a landslide rebellion against trump and they will also take the senate. ,Ashamed_Job_8151,2025-04-15T12:34:25,2

"Republican criminal activities are fair game  if they are not tied to Trump.  Republicans in general are also fair game, by Trump.  I'll bet that half of Cabinet are gone by the mid-terms, if not sooner.   If you look at his EOs and other actions, the majority by a long shot are in one way or another related to Biden (even his stance against Ukraine can be traced back to his initial frustration with Zelenskyy not willing to give up dirt on the Bidens back in what, 2017?).  His attacks on journalist, many lawyers, and so on boil down to personal grievence.  I  personally don't think that he has any real agenda other than revenge despite claiming a desire to go down in history as the most transformational POTUS, ever, and maybe to benefit financially in the process.  He may be able to accomplish this in one way or another if he was not so damn hell bent on getting even.",crucial_geek,2025-04-15T14:04:33,4
"Historically, the House flips during the mid-terms to the other party.  I believe that, considering 100% of the House is up every two years, that only two mid-terms over the last 40 years did not flip.  So, it is expected to happen regardless.  Now, if there is the so called Blue Wave, then yes, that would be a direct referendum on Trump.  For the Senate, if you look at the Republican seats that are up, it is going to be hard for Dems to take control as they would need to pick up something like 5 seats, which of course assumes they keep their 13 seats that are up in 2026.  For the Repubs, they have something like 20 seats, all in red states, and of these maybe 7 are doable, but it will be tough.  Two Dem Senators are retiring in 2026, which is going to complicate things as incumbents tend to win Senatorial races.  But if Dems take both the House and the Senate, you can bet the first thing they do is impeach Trump.  Honestly, depending on how things are going next year, it might be better to keep Trump in office depending on perspective.",crucial_geek,2025-04-15T14:12:00,1
