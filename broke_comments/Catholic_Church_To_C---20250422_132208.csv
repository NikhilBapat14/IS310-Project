Likely not since many of the cardinals voting for the next guy were appointed by Pope Francis.,ancienteggfart,2025-04-22T13:47:00,55

"Cardinals are reportedly eager to move past the papacy of Francis and focus on such classic doctrines such as all the stuff that's in the Bible and Catholic teaching. ""I actually can't remember what's in the Bible at this point,"" said Poupard. ""We should see what it says. It might be important.""",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-22T16:08:45,30

Really?  The Pontifex Maximus being someone other than a faithful member of Rome's pagan institution?,ObadiahtheSlim,2025-04-23T06:32:43,-6
Yea. 100% stacked and rigged to continue to push liberal politics. Which explains the decline in yearly baptisms and church attendance declining as well,MoisterOyster19,2025-04-23T03:16:01,2

Basically a pope who doesn’t reinvent the Bible is a neo-Nazi to them. Easier to just ignore 50% of the people. There are millions who are still sensible. ,Reuters-no-bias-lol,2025-04-23T05:32:52,2
"Vatican 2 falsely claims Muslims worship the same God as Christians (in contradiction to Vatican 1), and Francis went further to say that people can go to heaven without Christ. Carholics have painted themselves into a theological corner, where to walk back these invented doctrines would self-refute papal infallibility. All that can be done is to pray for them to admit to centuries worth of errors and come back to the teachings of Christ.",WesternDissident,2025-04-23T09:08:13,2
