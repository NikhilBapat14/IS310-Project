"Modern leftists try to paint Nazism and Fascism as ""far-right"" movements; but they forget that before WW2, they were both loved by the Progressive movement.  EDIT: A leftist sent me a chat message claiming Progressives  ""in now way existed during the rise of Hitler"" (sic), so I just thought I'd point even Wikipedia- which is in no way a right-leaning site- states that [the Progressive movement started in the late 1800s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Era).",MarioFanaticXV,2025-04-22T22:00:59,31

"Nazism means National Socialism. Hitler disagreed on socialism for everyone, he thought socialism should only be for the Germanic peoples, but he agreed on the economic principles of the state controlling all modes of production and the destruction of the free market.",AldrichOfAlbion,2025-04-22T23:17:58,16
I read what he said. It's one of the sickest things I've ever read from a liberal. He should be ashamed of himself. Mooching off of the horrors of the holocaust to make political jabs. He should know better. He should know that Trump is not even close to Hitler. When people think of Hitler they think of 6 million dead Jews. They think of trains full of Jewish people taken to be gassed. They think of mom's with their babies being executed in front of a gigantic pit. They don't think of these little nuance BS political football games.,BossJackson222,2025-04-23T20:32:55,1
Modern leftists/progressives can clearly draw their roots across 20th century American Democrat politics. The obsession with race and identity is extends back centuries.Â ,Texas103,2025-04-23T13:46:37,3
I get these unhinged chat messages from the left every week. I just report them as harassment to Reddit. Believe it or not about 90% of them get banned for it. I've been on Reddit for years and years. I have never messaged a liberal because I was angry at what they said. I would never even think of that. But this is how unhinged these sick people are.,BossJackson222,2025-04-23T20:34:22,3
