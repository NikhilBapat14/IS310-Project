"You mean they could defend and close the border; gut bureaucratic bloat, optimize the actual constitutional function of the federal government AND save US taxpayers a boatload of money?  I say, bring it on!",boundpleasure,2025-04-16T16:39:07,26

"All they had to do after Trump's first term was govern vaguely responsibly, and they'd be solidly in power now.   Even today, all they have to do is explain how they would solve the same problems better than Trump, and at least they'd have a fighting chance. But they don't want to solve problems, they want to fundraise off problems.",woailyx,2025-04-17T06:29:44,5
"The difference is, Trump's policies are *popular*.  People have wanted these things for years.  ",BoredAtWork1976,2025-04-16T17:01:49,3
"Just be clear, I believe there is too much power currently in the executive branch.  However, the opposition has (along with my party) given its powers away freely in the name of getting their agenda through.  What we are seeing now is the result of that dereliction of duty. One example; immigration reform / legislation is a congressional duty.  Both parties (and their supporters) have different reason for lax immigration and have been willing to let the executive branch take responsibility for success or failure.   Mandatory budgetary spending (SS, Medicare, Medicaid, etc) is what kills our budget and increases the debt/deficit.  It is also the third rail of politics and none of these people can see past their own reelection.   Trump is done (no more offices or elections).  He has nothing to lose politically.  I want him to break things where they need to be broken.  I hope and want Vance to be able to then “fix and repair” them if needed correctly.  Will that happen?  🙏🏻🤞🏻",boundpleasure,2025-04-17T07:01:49,3
