"From Semafor's Max Tani:  Paramount owner Shari Redstone in recent days sought to know which upcoming 60 Minutes stories were about President Donald Trump, according to two people familiar with the situation — triggering a series of events that ended with the Tuesday resignation of the show’s longtime producer.  Producer Bill Owens resigned abruptly this week, complaining that he no longer had the editorial independence to run the iconic Sunday evening news show.  In a note first shared with The New York Times, Owens said that “over the past months, it has become clear that I would not be allowed to run the show as I have always run it, to make independent decisions based on what was right for ’60 Minutes,′ right for the audience.”  “So, having defended this show — and what we stand for — from every angle, over time with everything I could, I am stepping aside so the show can move forward,” he wrote.

It’s not a matter of cowardice. The media is owned by the same billionaires who also own many or most elected officials and government institutions. Most media is now the propaganda arm of the corpo-fascist state.,William_S_Burros,2025-04-22T20:57:57,10
"They can't. Like William said, the media was bought out by the billionaires ***specifically*** so they could no longer do the very thing you're talking about. The aristocracy has fully restored its dominance.",LordSiravant,2025-04-22T23:44:54,5
