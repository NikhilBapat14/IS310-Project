"Bad faith should *always* be assumed when it comes to the Trump administration.  If this could either be for Trump’s birthday or the Army’s 250th, we should assume the former by default unless overwhelmingly evidence shows the opposite.  And here, that is not the case. Trump is a dictator, and he wants to do dictator things. He has previously asked for a similar waste of funds in his previous term, where he was very publicly blocked.  In contrast, the Army has not previously done military parades on Flag Day. Not during past years, not during the 225th or 200th.   So on one hand we have a record of Trump wanting these types of parades. On the other, we have evidence of the Army *not* wanting this.  Once again, if we just assume bad faith, we very quickly come to the correct conclusion: this is mostly for Trump, not the Army.  Further, let’s examine the idea that Trump would want a military celebration. This is not in congruence with Trump’s approach to the military. Trump was a 5-time draft dodger that faked injury to avoid Vietnam, and constantly skips military celebrations and honors. He chose golf over honoring dead soldiers literally last week, for example.  He does, however, honor himself. Constantly, vaingloriously.   So again, we must use Trump’s Razor:  >When presented with multiple hypotheses or explanations for why Trump would take an action, one should choose the one that assumes the worst intentions or posits the fewest out of character actions for Trump",ManBearScientist,2025-04-09T09:39:02,0

"He puts all his security up at his resort at $1000 a room.  He has to fly down on Air Force 1.  Needs military overflight of Air Force 1 and closes the nearby air space.  The route from the airport to Mango-a-loga is closed for an hour or so and needs police security the whole way which is all usually OT for the officers. This happens twice, once on the way there and once on the way back.     Then the course needs to be secured hours in advance for the full 18 holes/10+ acres.
