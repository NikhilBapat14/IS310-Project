"Summary: ​the article highlights growing financial stress among American consumers. This strain is attributed to rising prices, partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs on Chinese imports. These tariffs have increased costs for consumer goods, leading to higher credit card balances and a surge in defaults. Economists express concern that this trend could weaken consumer spending, a key driver of the US economy, potentially impacting overall economic growth.​",Perseus_NL,2025-04-24T08:56:37,11

"The craziest thing is tariffs haven't even fully hit consumers yet. From what little I've read, most companies will keep 90 days worth of product in inventory. The tariffs went into effect early April so we won't see the full brunt of them until later when those inventories start depleting and pricing is forced to adjust",dustyjuicebox,2025-04-24T12:19:52,4
