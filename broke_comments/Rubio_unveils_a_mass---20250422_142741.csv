"So when that memo leaked the other day about how they were going to gut the department, and they denied it was real, they were lying as usual? I'm shocked, shocked I tell you...well, not that shocked",SortByCont,2025-04-22T14:30:49,10
"January 6th, but this time the individuals responsible are Trump’s “loyalists”.   Sounds like “DOGE” State Department style.  So ever since he got impeached, Trump has had it out for the State Department? Now they’re trying to get total control to reorganize it-they aren’t saying what or where *specifically*, but they’ll be “real thoughtful” about it.   What they’re *going* to do, if *ALLOWED*, is gut any institution that can stand between Trump & holding on to power. He really is trying to make himself invincible-with lots of help from Rubio, Noehm, RFK Jr.  All these things going on?? January 6th, but this time? The call is coming from inside the house!",Ill-WeAreEnergy40,2025-04-22T14:30:28,1
Rubio had nothing to do with it. This is purely Steven Miller/Russell Vought shenanigans. More folks need to start blaming these two right alongside Trump and others.,PotatoeGuru,2025-04-22T15:12:55,1

So this means he should take reduced pay if he has less to manage?,drishaj,2025-04-22T18:49:58,0
Why isn’t anyone DOING anything? They’re actually helping him dismantle *anything* that can keep him in check.,Ill-WeAreEnergy40,2025-04-22T14:33:10,1

"Because everyone in a position to do anything agrees with what he's doing.  The Dem voter base wasn't happy with the candidate or Israel so a big chunk said ""What's the worst that can happen?  We have checks and balances, the system will protect us"" and didn't show up.  Now all of the checks and balances belong to MAGA.  The only leverage they have is the fillibuster, and that isn't much use for this situation (though it should be enough to preserve the Judiciary....maybe).     The next step in doing something is to learn to protest like the French - burn shit down and engage in industrial action, but we just aren't there yet (couldn't even show up for a candidate we didn't love), and frankly it may be the excuse they're CLEARLY looking for to use the DoD as an internal security force.",SortByCont,2025-04-22T14:46:31,5

"No.   Well, that as well.   I mean: the *CONSTITUTION* that all these people, but especially the president of USA, pledges an oath to uphold  NEED TO DO SOMETHING!",Ill-WeAreEnergy40,2025-04-22T21:42:54,1
"People did vote, that’s not the problem really, friend.   The problem is: we should all be able to agree that the Constitution of the USA is the foundation of our country.  FREEDOM of religion FREEDOM of speech FREEDOM of Press FREEDOM!!  We are supposed to allow each other to *live and let live*.   How come 1 side has to put up with murders due to guns, but the other 1/2 isn’t having *their* rights protected?!",Ill-WeAreEnergy40,2025-04-22T21:46:32,1
