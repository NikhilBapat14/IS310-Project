And they love it, because they know they can say whatever toxic thoughts come to mind and nobody will call them out for it‚Ä¶least of all the dumbasses sending them money.

I remember the news articles back in the 70's and the media pushing the narrative that criminals are just victims of their circumstances.  This has blossomed to today where the criminals are really victims and the victims the criminals.,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-17T20:59:10,21
