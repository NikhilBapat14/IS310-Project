"If Crimea was a sticking point then the ‘deal’ was nowhere near ‘close’ and a long way beyond the horizon.  As usual, PoopyPants is punching down on Ukraine, playing for Putin and, of course, lying.",AINonsense,2025-04-23T13:16:35,2

"I am the World's Best Deal maker OK? There's NEVER been a better deal maker than me. The world's best deal makers come to me for advice and say ""Sir, when it comes to making deals you Sir are the best""  So when I fought Putin to get Zelenskyy all the land from Kiev to Odessa west to the Polish border, NO ONE in the world thought I could get Putin to agree to such a bad deal for Russia after all they suffered through with this war started by Ukraine. But instead of showing me respect and appreciating all my hard work, Zelenskyy is a disgusting, disrespectful, horrible loser, OK?",TopEagle4012,2025-04-23T13:23:43,1

All he has to do is give away half a trillion in mineral rights for the next 100 years... I mean he started the war clearly by allowing Ukraine to exist so why does he expect to not give up Ukraines future and not become a slave nation?,LegitimatelisedSoil,2025-04-23T13:22:11,6
"US and China weren’t even in a trade war. Essentially, Trump was the drunk guy at a bar that threw a punch and started pleading once he saw China was relatively unfazed. It’s just painful to watch",Rocket_League-Champ,2025-04-23T14:03:31,3
Perhaps Trump's chances are better in Greenland and Canada. They are certainly not so stubborn there.,Spirited-Top3307,2025-04-23T13:58:49,0
