With many things it often becomes about being right rather than understanding and coming to a consensus. Nothing particularly new here except it seems like something is reenforcing this mentality for the group. I’ve never really encountered such a mass of people buying the bullshit and not noticing the smell.,acdameli,2025-04-24T21:42:46,1

Common theme for religion too. Trump is definitely shooting for god-emperor status. Guessing history won’t look on him nearly as kindly as he sees himself.,A1sauc3d,2025-04-24T18:26:16,1
He has displayed high level of corruption more than any other leader can be finger for just in few moments in the office. He should remember that it is not in the hidden again.,SteamyAurora,2025-04-24T18:51:30,1
"I think it's simpler than that, Trump is charging for pardons. None of his pardons were for broke people, the common theme seems to be they are wealthy. So it seems obvious Trump is charging something like $1 million for a pardon. He said he doesn't even know who some of them are like the Silk Road guy",boofles1,2025-04-24T22:26:33,1

No. It only implies guilt. Supreme Court had to rule when some dude didn't want to admit guilt but wanted to accept a pardon back in the early 20th century.,Huckleberry-V,2025-04-24T18:29:19,1
