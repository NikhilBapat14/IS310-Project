"Honestly, watching this administration fumble so visibly is just... something, especially given how the retaliatory tariffs and the board with wild figures that confused economists, it's all just a mess, and the fact that Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has seemingly made several others, including briefly canceling Ebola prevention aid and indiscriminately firing government workers just feels like another layer of this disturbing reality.",avid-learner-bot,2025-04-23T08:03:05,10

My one solace is that dictatorships require a degree of competence and organization. Trump gutted competence at all levels of the government and hired horribly inexperienced sycophants. All of his actions are idiotic and go against the interests of average Americans.  Yes there is a cult following but when the breaking point is reached I don’t know if this regime will have the support or organization required to keep it going.,Thin_Ad_2046,2025-04-23T09:22:41,3

"They’re not mistakes.   It’s called “conscious of guilt”. The most obvious base psychology ever.   I had ChatGPT help the rolling stone. It wrote this at my request.  My Request: Write a rolling stone article citing a myriad of examples of trump displaying “consciousness of guilt”  Sure thing—here’s a Rolling Stone-style article that explores the concept of Donald Trump displaying “consciousness of guilt,” with a voice and structure reminiscent of their political features.  ⸻  “He Knows What He Did”: The Many Ways Donald Trump Shows He’s Guilty as Hell By Rolling Stone Political Staff  In criminal law, there’s a telling little phrase—“consciousness of guilt.” It means actions that suggest a person knows they’ve done something wrong, and they’re trying to cover it up, deflect, or otherwise protect themselves. In Donald Trump’s case, the signs aren’t subtle. They’re neon-bright and blaring through a bullhorn.  From obstructing investigations to pressuring witnesses, Trump’s playbook looks less like the behavior of a wrongly accused man and more like a masterclass in how to act when you’re terrified of the truth coming out.  Let’s take a tour through some of Trump’s greatest hits—moments that prosecutors and legal analysts have flagged again and again as textbook “consciousness of guilt.”  ⸻  1. “I just want to find 11,780 votes.”  In the infamous call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on January 2, 2021, Trump didn’t simply claim fraud—he asked for a specific number of votes to be “found,” just enough to flip the state.  That wasn’t a request to investigate. That was a mob boss asking for a fix. It was so bad, Georgia’s Republican secretary of state had the presence of mind to record it—and the world heard Trump laying bare his panic over losing.  ⸻  2. “If you’re innocent, why are you taking the Fifth?” (Then: Trump takes the Fifth over 400 times.)  Back in 2016, Trump said, “The mob takes the Fifth. If you’re innocent, why are you taking the Fifth Amendment?”  Fast-forward to 2022. During a deposition with the New York Attorney General in the civil fraud case against him and the Trump Organization, Trump invoked the Fifth over 400 times.  Even more telling: He refused to answer even basic questions about his own business. That’s not just legal strategy. That’s a guy who knows every word could open a new door to prosecution.  ⸻  3. “Will no one rid me of this meddlesome special counsel?”  Okay, he didn’t literally say that. But according to Robert Mueller’s report, Trump tried—repeatedly—to get officials to fire Mueller or otherwise derail the Russia investigation. When that didn’t work, he tried to get witnesses to change their stories or refuse cooperation.  Mueller famously stopped short of charging obstruction, but laid out the evidence for Congress. That evidence? It read like a guilty man flailing to stop the walls from closing in.  ⸻  4. “Don’t testify. You’re taken care of.”  During the Mueller probe, Trump’s allies reportedly dangled pardons in front of witnesses like Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort, and Roger Stone. In Stone’s case, Trump commuted his sentence entirely just before he was set to report to prison.",ipostthingsonreddit,2025-04-23T08:34:44,-2
