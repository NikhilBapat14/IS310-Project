Anything less than prison for his reckless disregard for national security should involve impeaching those who insist he needs to stay in office. Too bad our congress is currently a clown show.,RealGianath,2025-04-24T18:02:01,1

"I'm fully expecting a story to come out that Hegseth was texting sensitive data to pick up women.   He did admit to 5 affairs. There could be more that he didn't admit to. And men like that don't suddenly flip an ""all faithful"" switch when they get *more* power.",Virtual-Pie5732,2025-04-24T17:58:31,1
The democrats should go Benghazi on this whole situation.,hainesk,2025-04-24T18:49:40,1
"Hegseth used the Signal app on a computer in his office that was connected to a commercial line and not a secure line. A commercial internet line does not have any sort of firewall protection the DoD's unclassified system has.  The dirty line was installed at Hegseth's request, too, so he could use the app on his computer.",progress18,2025-04-24T17:53:18,1

I think all his lines are “dirty lines”,consumeshroomz,2025-04-24T18:56:12,1
Oh it’s for Signal??   My bad. I thought it was so he could livestream himself applying makeup at his Glamdesk in the Pentagon.,Ohuigin,2025-04-24T19:20:03,1
Has he been fired yet? Dude’s a joke lol. Completely incompetent moron. Although you could say that about most of the people trump appointed to top spots… along with trump himself,A1sauc3d,2025-04-24T17:53:12,1
The one thing I am certain of is that conservatives who viewed the security of classified information to be of paramount importance in 2016 will be lining up to demand prosecution.  Right?  ……right?,eskimospy212,2025-04-24T18:50:46,1

"If I accidentally mishandled one piece of paper - say just a coversheet of outdated info, I'd fully expect to be read the Riot Act, invalidated from ever holding a clearance again, and likely looking for a new job.  Hell, training takes a moment to remind us that we CAN/SHOULD prioritize saving our own lives over properly securing documents in case of a fire or other emergency. Wonder how many incidents it took to include that part.",JakeConhale,2025-04-24T21:34:45,1
"A man pretending to be loyal to his wives, his county and his oath whose only real loyalty (besides to his own hubris) is to a man who's even more arrogant, ignorant and disloyal than he is. He's young enough that there's faint hope he'll one day face more dire consequences than having a bad hair day or a bad hangover. The sad, sad thing is that I'm not even sure he'll be thrown under the bus, never mind being thrown onto the unemployment line or behind bars.",__dilligaf__,2025-04-24T19:36:04,1

If Hegseth requested it he should be in trouble not a technician installer- the installer wouldn’t know what it was for,tincerbell16,2025-04-24T18:23:45,1
I promise that anyone who is installing something in the Sec Def’s office has been thoroughly vetted and knows exactly what they should and shouldn’t be able to do there.   He’s literally the second highest ranking person in charge of the US military. They’re not calling Comcast to come out and install this line. It would be a massive security breach.,fleurgirl123,2025-04-24T18:34:02,1
Do we know the drunk didn’t bring in a random comcast tech with no vetting to install it?,Ready_Nature,2025-04-24T19:12:16,1
>It would be a massive security breach.  ... Like broadcasting war plans on an unsecured Signal chat on an unsecured internet line...?,crazyfighter99,2025-04-24T19:16:26,1
