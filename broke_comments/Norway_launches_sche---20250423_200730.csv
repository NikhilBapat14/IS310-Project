"No need to lure, they are already fleeing the US",Sarcasmgasmizm,2025-04-23T20:11:09,170
The Trump administration is doing to US academia what Hitler and the Nazis did to Germany in the 1930's.  It didn't work out well for the Germans and it doesn't portend great things for the US.  Very stupid and sad.,Only_Mastodon4098,2025-04-23T20:13:38,55

Great move by Norway as International researchers by far outnumber American citizens in STEM degree courses at graduate/PhD/Post-doc levels and large majority of them are from developing countries so they will want to secure their future in another developed country with research jobs.,Plastic_Ad_1106,2025-04-23T20:15:50,35

"It's not just Norway. Every major economy is trying to woo American scientists. China and India are trying to bring back the hundreds of top class postdocs and early career faculty from their respective countries to equivalent positions back home. France literally started a grant to help American scientists relocate if they want to.  America's success since WW2 has largely been because we've lured the world's best talent (whether it was the Germans immediately after WW2 or Indians/Chinese right now) in the sciences here by promising top class research facilities, a very competitive salary and, most importantly, research freedom. Every other major nation has tried for a long time to either model or replicate our success. It's honestly depressing to see it all pissed away simply because a few people wanted to 'own the libs'.",InitiativeCultural72,2025-04-23T23:54:58,21
