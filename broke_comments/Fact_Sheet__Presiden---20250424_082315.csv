"Racially motivated ""progressives"" who thinks equality should mean equality of outcome instead of equality of opportunity are currently seething and in shambles.",Mountain_Man_88,2025-04-24T08:35:30,25

"In my early 20s, I applied for a job as a police officer. After passing the background and interviews, I moved on to the physical test, which included dragging a 180 lb dummy for 20 feet. I didn't even weigh 100 lbs myself, and thus could not perform. I was immediately out. I was disappointed for sure, but it helped me understand that I wasn't qualified for that job, and I understood it immediately.",obscurityknocks,2025-04-24T15:03:44,3
"This is HUGE. ""Disparate impact"" is why every job requires a degree, why degree creep is happening, and why colleges get away with overcharging for tuition.  ""Disparate impact"" outlawed many forms of credential and intelligence testing, so college degree became a proxy for that and turned into job tickets. Biden's DOJ aggressively went after jobs like firefighting and policing which used testing that had ""racist"" or ""sexist"" outcomes.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-24T13:22:25,0
"I gave up everything to come here as a teenager, leaving behind a communist dictatorship with the same woke ideology leftists love so much.  Equality of opportunity and meritocracy is what I want to see in the Free World, not DEI and racial quotas! America is back! üòç",rdenghel,2025-04-24T09:28:26,2
