"I think it should be easy to move to the United States legally—student visas, work visas, H1B visas, asylum, green cards, etc. should all be straightforward to get with predefined rules and no lotteries.

"libertarian    If theres a housing shortage, build more houses...  If theres a job shortage, do what youre suppose to do and incentivize job creation.... Hint, with more construction, there will be more construction jobs, so at least you got one industry going   If youre scared migrants will lower the cost of workers, give more protections to workers, just do the opposite of whatever has been going on since 1981 in the us   If youre scared of higher crime, you  shouldnt be cuz migrants cause less crime than nation borns, but ig fund police more if youre really scared   If youre scared about national security, frankly, idk what migration has to do with that   If youre scared of an economic recession, let migrants in, its a boost to the economy   If youre scared of social security and other social programs running out, let migrants in, they add more to the system than take out...

"It depends on the privileges that citizens/immigrants enjoy.  In socially-progressive countries like in Europe, immigration is notoriously difficult, because there’s no way you can offer free healthcare and retirement benefits to everyone who wants it by nature of an easy immigration system.  Countries like Canada have a bit of a tiered immigration system. It’s hard to immigrate, unless you’re a fairly well-off student or professional worker who can pay to get work authorization, and don’t need government subsidies. It’s a very different paradigm than in the US where many low-income people are crossing the border.  I’m of the belief that if any rich country, such as the US, had a libertarian immigration system then it would absolutely be abused to the point of failure by anyone looking to come there for work. Every country has the right and duty to allow immigrants in a manner that benefits the country and doesn’t overwhelm its resources.",bfhurricane,2025-04-13T22:48:47,25
"More in the direction of legalistic. I don’t like the inherent value-laden language you use.   Immigrants here for labor should pay taxes, though probably at a lower rate as they don’t enjoy full use of state services. We should take better care to ensure student and worker visas do not discourage companies/schools from taking on citizens or incentivize depressing wages for locals. Worker visas should go to the far ends of employment: work that it’s hard to find people with the right skillset, or work that citizens don’t want to do.   There should be much stricter enforcement against businesses hiring illegal workers, and apartments renting to them. Owners and landlords should themselves be fined and charged for breaking migration law. Policy should be changed to require that a potential refugee stay and gain asylum in the first safe country, not use asylum in order to economically migrate.   For people who would be citizens in the West, they need to demonstrate appreciation for western values. This includes tolerance of people of different sex, race and religion, not mistreating people on the basis of their sex, embracing freedom of speech, and, because the Paradox of Tolerance is a thing, people who oppose the West, or practice some form of religious or cultural practice incompatible with western values, should not be allowed.  Migration and granting citizenship is a privilege, not a right. At least in the West, there are literally billions who would like to be here. We should be more discerning on who we place in the front of the line. Absolutely we should take in people from the global south, who are worse off, in many cases from the excesses of actions in previous centuries. But we live as if in a lifeboat, and citizens will not tolerate taking on more migrants that they feel they can handle, or voters will move in a rightward direction, which helps neither migrants nor the nation, often. So, a country does best on migration policy when it uses law and law enforcement to ensure migrants are either legitimately refugees, or are coming in to bring real benefit to the nation, and in either case that they will preferably integrate to the local norms and culture, or at a minimum are not hostile to the same.",Netherese_Nomad,2025-04-13T22:40:00,11
"Make it an clear, fair, fast & predictable process (for all forms of visas, asylum and naturalization). Strengthen and enforce e-verify (with significant and escalating penalties for offenders).

"I'm not sure what the tangible harm is in letting anyone who can contribute in. We already have a process for it. There's concern about jobs but it feels as if the fundamental problem with lack of jobs is tied less to immigration and more to the general fact that all  businesses are pressured to maximize profits and thus all businesses are incentivized to employee as few people as possible while automating the rest.    I also know that there are countries with severe demographic collapse, and I know we have a shortage of healthcare professionals, so I feel like we should be incentivizing schooling for healthcare while also trying to pull in skilled doctors from other countries.    I feel like there's an idea that if we simply curtailed immigration, everything will get better. And yeah there'll be less competition for some jobs, but Americans generally don't want to do those, and... Maybe this is silly, but if the problem is that there isn't enough work to go around because of outsourcing, immigration and automation, why is there so much emphasis on making up tasks to do or preventing others from doing them in order to justify providing basic needs to our citizens? Plus, there's all of those rural towns that are dying out and these aren't the places that immigrants are even going to. What about them?     I'm not sure about totally open borders, but we've also meddled in and arguably ruined quite a few of the countries that are flooding the southern border with asylum seekers, and it's hard not to feel like we should maybe give some leeway because of that, *to an extent.*   Isn't immigration relatively low down the list of things that would help those who can't find work or struggle to pay rent?",Zagden,2025-04-13T23:15:05,3
"Both. I am very much pro immigration and we should make it much easier to come to the US legally. Also you should not be rewarded in any way for breaking the rules and coming here illegally. Deportation should be the first solution, not the last. I would partner that with a quasi amnesty policy where if you were here before this new policy was implemented you can stay as an American national but with no pathway for citizenship.  You want citizenship you can go home and get in line but if you’re fine with not voting then welcome aboard.",kingjoey52a,2025-04-14T01:32:41,3

"Here, someone tell what I am:  Before the immigration debate, I'd prefer the country bear the cost of getting every citizen the proper documentation for themselves. Make it cheap and easy for citizens to find their info so they can get IDs and register to vote.  Once that system is established, then I'm all for making voting very secure, but also make it easy, and accessible, and allow for same day registration. Additionally, require jobs bear the burden of only hiring citizens and legal immigrants. Citizens can easily prove they're citizens because of my first point, and as for legal immigrants:  Improve the immigration process. The US can work with some countries to let those countries help their own citizens get to the US legally, which helps us when they arrive. We can give them prescreening instructions and potentially fine or do something if we keep finding issues with their process. We can then give them proper documentation with clear rules on what they can and cannot do in the US. Make the process better so that doing it the right way works well for all parties involved.  For illegal immigrants, punish the companies hiring them. Because we've made it easy for citizens to prove they're citizens, and we've improved the immigration system, it should be easy for companies to prove they've hired legal workers. If they can't prove they're hiring legal workers, then hit them with HEAVY fines. If a company needs more workers, the company can work with immigration, and immigration can work with some of the partner countries like I pointed out above on these needs.  For illegal immigrants who are caught, instead of making them extremely fearful of being caught, offer a secondary immigration process that allows them to work towards legal immigration, but not as quick and easy and with additional requirements they regularly check in with police/immigration, and potentially harsher fines if caught up with the law.  We can also work trade deals with other countries and include some immigration requirements in the deal, but do it professionally, not just randomly and on a whim.",OhWhatsHisName,2025-04-14T08:40:25,3
"IMHO Being libertarian on immigration is great in theory but a mess in practice.  If you have more capitalist small-welfare state style economy like the US then your average citizen is unlikely to see the benefits of immigration like GDP growth. They'll just watch the basic supply and demand for labor tip toward low wages and high housing costs.  If you have a more socialist welfare state like Europe then you have to choose whether immigrants can access benefits. If they can, enjoy your flood, if they can't, well now you've just crated a two-tier civilization. might as well legalize segregation at that point.  While admittedly things aren't quite as black and white as I've explained them here the overall points remain, it's always likely to become a political headache. It's why we even see modern Europe, probably the most open and tolerant civilization in human history, now seeing partially-fascist parties getting upwards of 35% of the  vote.",CirnoWhiterock,2025-04-13T22:28:30,10
"I am for border security.  That said...  Come to the country legally and I am... Hurray!!!!!!!  Problem is the Republican call ""asking for asylum"" entering illegally.  Yes I feel to many use asylum as an excuse to enter.  Why I advocate for more judges to process these people.  It should not take years to process someone's request.  Make asylum requests from countries that clearly have issues.  For example why would anyone from England need asylum? Yes there can be exceptions but clearly we know why people are leaving certain countries.  The whole process needs to be streamlined. Trump killed a really good bipartisan bill before the election so he could run on it.  Now he he removes people (Americans too) without due process to jails the world considers human right violations.    We need legal immigrant workers for all kinds of work.  We need tech workers , farm workers etc.  Trump and the current MAGA Republicans have turned immigration into a hate issue.  Just like 1930s Germany.  Florida would rather force children to work then have legal immigrants working.  When Trumps immigration policies really hit, prices for food will go up. FLorida is already seeing a decline in farm workers and it is effecting their economy.  Fewer people collecting food, the more rots in the fields and prices will go up. Now lets add Trumps tariffs.   If someone is here illegally I say remove them to their country of origin.  I do not like sending folks to hard core jails in El Salvador.  It is a human rights issue.  Why are English citizens being sent back to Briton in leg irons at the waist for minor visa violations?  This is NOT American.  This current policy is based on HATE.  I would say I am in between your Authoritarian and Libertarian definitions.",StromburgBlackrune,2025-04-14T00:36:33,2
"Neither, but closer to what you are calling libertarian for the immigrants. Illegal immigration on land stolen with treaties that the people who wrote the treaties violated is asinine.   I believe it should be easy to immigrate legally. Prison sentences and estate seizures to illegally hire anyone to do anything. That may convince them to pass immigration legislation that would allow people to hire people to do the jobs that need done. Politicians who advocate for the violation of treaties should also be arrested and replaced, so they understand that the laws that govern asylum are not subject to their opinion.   I think anyone who is found to have ever violated student or visitor visas should be barred from or holding any accounts in the country where they are violating the laws from, but the application to modify a visa should be far quicker and easier if fraud was not used to obtain the visa.   Just so you know, Libertarian means different things in different locations. In most of the world, it means what you described. In the US, it is the belief that corporations should run everything, an individual should not be prosecuted for most nonviolent drug offenses, and the rich should not have to pay taxes or deal with regulations they don’t like.   Most people here also do not think of themselves as authoritarian. Some people are mask off fascists, and will say they are authoritarian, but most of the people who are authoritarian think that they believe in democracy, but there are people working against them and are paying others and spreading disinformation and everyone would vote the same if they knew the truth.",SuperConfused,2025-04-14T08:21:56,2
"I think allowing people into this country is a good thing. It's an easy way to gain a larger talent pool.   I also think people should come here legally.    But I also think the process to legally come here and become a citizen is so stupid, convoluted, expensive, lengthy, and difficult, that it drives people to come here illegally or stay here beyond their visa.

"more authoritarian.    The mass waves of migration are definitely causing a lot of negative externalities upon society and our  federal, state, and local budgets.       10-20 years ago when the social safety nets were not extended to migrants anything like today, and we had more manufacturing jobs and less automation the migrants were a bigger value add.   but our labor force participation has steadily been dropping,   that's just for 18-65 year olds so  its not dropping cause more people are retired.  just less people work these days.      also mass migration doesn't assimilate.   some people want our country, which doesn't have a unifying ethnicity or religion , to also not have a shared sense of culture & history.   but a lack of unity is not a good thing.

Libertarian; back in the days US-Mexico border wasn’t as strict as the past 50 years. Migrant workers went back and forth based on worker’s permit; worked in the US around spring/summer in the fields and left prior to winter time.

Why not both?  I have zero tolerance for people entering the country illegally and believe they should not have any ability to claim asylum at all.  They need to get shipped out.  I also think immigrating should be made a lot easier then it currently is.  The reason they make it hard to immigrate has everything to do with racism in the Trump administration.  Lets not fool ourselves and think they are doing it just because of the rule of law.  They just don't want more people who are non white to immigrate.  So while I support deporation.  I also think we should allow a lot more immigration then we currently do.  And as far as speech is concerned.  If they are here legally and or here on a visa of some type.  As along as it isn't a terroristic threat with OVERT connotations of violence such as saying that xyz should be shot killed and this is who you donate too in order to make it happen.  I think it should be no different then any other citizen in being able to exercise freedom of speech.  Immigration should focus on this.  Can the person support themselves when they immigrate.  And would they be a burden on society itself if they are here?  That is the only question we should be asking.  What this means on a practical level is that we would get a lot of immigrants from poorer countries.  HOWEVER it also means they would be AMBITIOUS.  HARD WORKING.  DRIVEN.  I WANT THOSE PEOPLE.  Don't give me the rich person who wants to immigrate and wants to drink a martinee.  I want the person who has 100 dollars to there name but instead has a plan to make it.  And set a goal for themselves.  This country did not make itself by people coming in who were rich.  It made itself by those who were poor and wanted something better and were not afraid to get off there asses and work for it.   Like my ancestors from Germany.  They didn't want to fight in some miserable ass war.  They wanted the government to let them farm in peace.

"The population of the United States is going to start decreasing, and we will face an issue similar to that of many other countries around the world.  That is, we will have too many old people and not enough working age people.  The solution to this is easy.  Legal immigration.  That has always been our strength.  They will pay taxes and social security, and they will help support the elderly.  Teach their children the skills necessary to make the United States prosper, and it will continue to do so.  You can be a proponent of a lot of legal immigration while also having a strong border protection and sufficient penalties for illegal immigration.  With our current system, tough penalties are necessary for illegal immigration; however, there are solutions such that we will benefit even if illegal immigration was not treated harshly.  The answer is a national sales tax combined with UBI (Universal Basic Income).  An national sales tax of 25% would allow every citizen of the United States to receive ~$1000 per month (non-taxed income).  (This can eventually be increased to $2000 per month depending on the success of the program and revenues.)  People would still be poor, but they can eat.  This program would only be available to citizens.  It would give non-citizens an incentive to become citizens.  A national sales tax would be shown on the shelf, not at check-out like state sales taxes.  (I think all of these taxes should be built into the actual price you see, not separate, though.  The reason they do this is to make sure you know that you were actually charged taxed as you should be, but that is a different discussion.)  This would be a regressive tax, but the UBI would offset this penalty.  (It should not be treated as taxable income!)  Just as most poor people spend most of their money, rich people would also receive the UBI benefit, but they would not even notice it.  It must be universal to work.  We can keep or eliminate various welfare programs that already exist, but the best way to help people is to give them money, not to try to figure out what they need one by one.  That results in too much beauracracy and red tape.  But, with such a program, even illegal immigrants would be guaranteed to pay taxes.  Everything they purchase would be taxed at 25%.  An argument against this is that the price of everything would spike 25%, but I have been saying we need UBI since before 2008, and at that time, the price of most things (even in the grocery store) spikes far more than 25%.  Then, we had the increase in prices from 2021 and onward.  Now, we are seeing these spikes again, and we will soon see a major increase in prices because of tariffs.  Therefore, the argument against it is irrelevant.  We should have already implemented this 20 years ago.  And it would not have the harmful consequences that we are going to see from the tariffs.",freebytes,2025-04-14T08:03:24,1

"As usual, given choices of 'A' or 'B', I prefer Option 'C'.   For starters, fuck this noise right here:  >*minimal government intervention.*  The deveopled world is facing a population crash. Every OECD nation except Israel is seeing natural population 'growth' that isn't growth. Every developed nation is currently reproducing below replacement rate, including China and India.   People are being treated by governments and their voters as a burden instead of as the treasure they are.   Every developed nation is facing a reality of too few workers to support too many old people. This problem is going to get a lot worse before it gets any better, if it ever does.   Population collapse is already baked into the demographic future of every deveopled nation.   A wise country would be importing people on purpose, and quickly. A wise government would be making hay while the sun shines. My policy recommendation, from a national interest perspective would be:  Easy to immigrate legally, light punishments for doing so illegally (fines, deportation as last resort, imprisonment only in cases of actual harm), same protections for non-citizens as citizens (fair trials, free speech, other constitutional/legal rights), light enforcement structures, and **strong government intervention to attract immigrants and make space for them, including strong government intervention to increase housing supply.**  To hell with that ""minimal intervention"" crap. This policy would be hard and controversial and would require serious top-down commitment, active management, and market-interventionist mitigation of the more probablamatic issues surrounding this immigration policy.

"I'm in between, and frankly don't particularly care for this false dichotomy. It is possible to have a strong, enforceable immigration law that doesn't round people up and ship them to El Salvador without due process. It's possible to have reasonable barriers to entry and legal processes to follow to establish residency/citizenship without weaponizing immigration status against political critics.  I think protections for non-citizens comparable to citizens is a must. If something is a legal and ethical right in a country, your country of origin shouldn't matter.  The problem is that the US has been one of the best places to immigrate to for most of its history. That's not a bad problem to have. It means your nation is safe and fair with lots of economic opportunity. So issues arise. For DECADES the US immigration quotas from many countries (Mexico a prime example) have been laughably low. Moreover, most of the people in the country illegally are gainfully employed and pay taxes and contribute to their communities. So why don't we make it so they can be here legally? Why don't we just raise the supply of number of people that can apply for a work visa/green card/etc to match the demand of the number of people trying to work here? Why don't we have more seasonal work permits for people who want to take the low paying labor intensive jobs that largely illegal immigrants already are doing? Why can't we make policy match reality? We can still punt border jumpers back across the Rio Grande, we can still arrest and deport people committing felonies and violent misdemeanors, or whatever criteria would be prudent. As we have been all along.  The answer is simple: an actual solution consistent with American values is opposed by the people who campaign on illegal immigration being a problem.

"A requirement being straightforward rules.  One flaw, for instance, goes to the requirements for applying for asylum. You need to enter the country and present yourself - already in the country - to apply. Once you apply you're legally here until the process to evaluate that is complete and a decision is made that you're not in any danger if returned to your original country. (As long as you show up for all required appointments and hearings.)  I'm pretty sure ""suspecting someone will try to claim asylum if they enter"" is a reason to deny entry which causes asylum seekers to enter somewhere other than a checkpoint.   Flip that and allow ""I'm here to seek asylum"" at the border with a grant of entry and immediate start to the evaluation process and you would cut down on illegal border crossings. The biggest challenge to making the asylum process faster is that we don't have enough immigration judges to evaluate the cases. (The bipartisan border bill that the Senate passed and then the house blocked on Trump's orders would have fixed that, among other things.)  The other thing is that it's far more common for people to overstay a valid entry visa than it is for people to cross a border illegally. Tourist visas that run out, student visas, temporary worker visas, etc. I never hear about expiration date enforcement being a big deal - just look at Elon Musk. Make it a simple process to periodically check in and extend things or something. (I never quite understood why we'd want someone to come here for a high quality education and then leave and apply what they learned somewhere else. Student visas should grant a green card upon graduation - or maybe do it for in-demand degrees.)",cballowe,2025-04-14T00:17:32,18

"> The purpose of this Act is to establish a merit-based system for obtaining U.S. citizenship that recognizes individual contributions through residency, education, employment, civic engagement, and other factors. >  >   Would not support this.  What this system literally does is it allows rich gentrified people into the country which really doesn't help the country much if at all except for niche cases.    What happens is that you will get people who are from corrupt countries who are in the upper bands of society who have degrees which they bought with fluence.  And are not really contributing to society at all.    Get rid of Civic engagement first and foremost.  Second would be that to drop investment in property.  That should be stripped out also.  Owning a business should have a lot higher point value particularly depending on the size of the business.  And point values should go up as the size scope and employee count of the business increases.  Educational requirements should focus more points of vocation specifically and in particular with trade, and bonus points on education specifically for targetted industries.  General degrees should be completely ignored.  Someone can get a degree in art history and even a doctorate.  But the point value of that shouldn't be the same as a doctor of medicine or pharmacy.    Anyways the system you have there is rife with issues and should be scrapped and reformed and shaped instead to focus on individuals who want to contribute to society.

"Thanks for having a real discussion on this subreddit. What I'm understanding is that you see migrants as contributing to the economy because they provide labor and a manager in the US has a job because they have the ability to schedule immigrant labor which produces goods in the US.

This provides cheaper roofing for those people who invest in real estate or who own homes.
