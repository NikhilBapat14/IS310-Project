"Sadly ‚Äû54% of American adults read below the equivalent of a sixth-grade level, and nearly one in five adults reads below a third-grade level (The Policy Circle). The performance levels indicate that only 46 percent of U.S. adults scored at Level 3 or above‚Äú. - You gotta need to be able to read to know whats in the constitution, or you ask your kind neighbor like this woman here to do it for you.  130 MILLION AMERICAN ADULTS HAVE LOW LITERACY SKILLS, BUT FUNDING DIFFERS DRASTICALLY BY STATE: [https://www.apmresearchlab.org/10x-adult-literacy](https://www.apmresearchlab.org/10x-adult-literacy)",Morgentau7,2025-04-16T12:15:54,70

And yet the people supporting a mad king who thinks he can do whatever he wants have somehow convinced themselves that they‚Äôre the real patriots and the true inheritors and guardians of the spirit of the American Revolution.,specqq,2025-04-16T14:42:52,12
"I‚Äôm not American, apologies, but I‚Äôm not familiar with this list. Is this actually an original list on why they revolted against the British? If so, this is most uncanny. It is as if this list was tailored to Trump‚Äôs deeds. With the exception of foreign mercenaries maybe? This is a stretch. But the rest? Are you sure the founding fathers weren‚Äôt time travelers?",PavlovsDog6,2025-04-16T12:48:19,5
People on the left constantly reassure me we are just as well armed and trained as right wingers. And here I thought Democrats didn‚Äôt believe in people owning things like AR15s ‚Äújust in case‚Äù.,ClimateQueasy1065,2025-04-16T21:42:19,5

"this is why Republicans want ID to vote instead of any kind of intelligence test, not that either are warranted since you can't register unless you're a US citizen and that's the requirement for voting. but if citizens had to pass even basic level elementary civics to vote, Republicans would never win their elections.",ms_directed,2025-04-16T14:16:53,5

"Because they love the second amendment, believe this is a christian nation, love to wave the flag, and hate minorities and outsiders.   All beliefs contrary to the beliefs of the founders.

"Humans are pretty simple creatures if you break society down to the basics. We didn‚Äôt change much, just our society got more advanced.  I bet they just knew people like Trump back then and what they could do. If you see how the US conquered the land they currently live on, then you need some crazy, selfish, radical bunch of people to pull that one of. They waged war against every tribe, nation or country in their way and somehow always got away with it. I bet the Founding Fathers knew people who were even worse than Trump although it‚Äòs hard to imagine.",Morgentau7,2025-04-17T04:29:14,3

"I remember how I was baffled that 1. the US has so many private schools and that 2. the richest woman of the US back then and owner of many private schools became Minister of Education during Trumps first term. Conflict of interest its father. - I always tell people: If the number of private schools rise, the end of democracy gets closer. Education should always be run by the state and be well thought through to maintain stability to the democracy.",Morgentau7,2025-04-16T12:41:50,14

"I guess you‚Äôre right, although my immediate inner contrarian jerked his head up at the ‚ÄúSociety got more advanced‚Äù part :) I wonder if it is just the technology and tools that advanced and people at the core - as you said - remained the same, regardless of any notion to the contrary - in either direction. We lack the practical experience of living in XVIII century society, so it might be both that we do not grasp the extent of the differences, AND lack the perspective on how many similarities there are between those and our times. Of course Dear Leader lacks perspective period‚Ä¶",PavlovsDog6,2025-04-17T05:45:52,1
