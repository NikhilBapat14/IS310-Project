"Waste of time and a distraction.  Since the Stock Market operates out of New York State, it is within their jurisdiction to at least investigate if there is the possibility.  Let them do it.   In the meantime, insider trading assumes insider knowledge, including when to time buys and sells.  Just because Trump posted that it is a 'good time to buy' is not insider trading.  Even if the temporary freeze was intentional with the hopes of making money, that is market manipulation --not insider trading.    Investors and normal people who play the stock market all knew to buy the dip.  It's just common knowledge in this scene.",crucial_geek,2025-04-14T07:11:40,3
Why do we bother wasting time on investigations if nobody is willing to enforce court orders?,destinyeeeee,2025-04-14T23:24:27,1

"Meh, presidential immunity this, presidential immunity that… they’ll never be able to confirm all of the facts. So it will take a miracle for that to happen.",gomezer1180,2025-04-14T10:33:15,1
If after his first term you still think he can be impeached at all then I have a bridge to sell you,volk96,2025-04-14T13:19:39,1
"Another edit:  just learned that Bloomberg tweeted a few hours ahead of the announcement that the 90 Day pause was going to be announced later in the day. So, maybe….",crucial_geek,2025-04-14T13:59:02,1

How when the administration just lies and says you don’t have access to that info. Why? Because presidential action… whatever they called that law the SCOTUS passed to protect him,gomezer1180,2025-04-14T15:23:22,1
"Read the ruling, like all 167 pages of it.  It specifically states that Trump, by name, is not above the law, and that he, as well as all other past and future Presidents, are immune from official duties as POTUS only and only if those duties do not violate the Constitution or existing law.   The ruling was also not a win for Trump, per se.  What the Justices ruled was that Smith needed to come back with proof that Trump's actions in Jan 6 were outside of his official duties and he would have a case.  They also told him to take it to another court.  Basically, get a bullet proof case, and it is good to go.    So, people need to get off this idea that this SCOTUS ruling applies to Trump and to Trump only.  Biden could've used it in the end, but didn't.    If you remember, Trump's defense was that he was ensuring a secure and fair election, and as such, was within the official duties of POTUS.   Smith was saying that he was really close to having that case, then Trump won, and well, that was that.",crucial_geek,2025-04-14T19:00:41,1
