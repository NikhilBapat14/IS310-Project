So basically all you have is brainwashed lefties that are angry with faux hate and can’t think for themselves so they rely on you to stoke the fires of hate even more.   Got it. Thanks for admitting you really don’t have value and that MSNBC is an enemy of the American people.,dottedoctet,2025-04-22T20:40:33,25
"MSNDC has been the anti-Fox from the beginning. Only thing worse was the channel that Gore sold to Al Jazeera. I watched that channel a few times and it made MSNDC look moderate.   Regular folks really don't understand how left, leftists are. They are fucking bonkers.",chances906,2025-04-22T21:19:04,12
"They admit they lean far left, stoke hate and fear to keep a deranged audience.   They are at least self aware. Doubt they will change though. ",Iamstillhere44,2025-04-24T07:06:26,1
