I don't get why these three companies have a monopoly on the airwaves. They basically say the same things. licenses for Broadcast TV should be lottery based and renewed every ten years.,Timely_Car_4591,2025-04-18T13:35:22,42

"Today's left is stuck on *""if I just nag them a little bit harder, they'll all be persuaded to my point of view!""*  That's what my dad was stuck on once his cocaine-induced downward spiral was past its point of no return. He just followed the rest of the family around bitching at us, acting like he wasn't getting what he was owed and we were all doing him wrong. **This was all he did at that point.**  This is why they refuse to air anything that doesn't go their way, and also why they latch onto every hoax that furthers their agenda **until the moment it suddenly doesn't,** then they just memory hole it and move to the next hoax immediately.   In my pop's paranoid delusions he started keeping stacks of graph paper on a clipboard and tracking all the lottery results so he could prove it was rigged - while he continued playing the lottery religiously (and not working or drawing an income from anywhere.)",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-18T13:03:32,18
"There are so many other options like cable and podcasts, and survey after survey proves that people in large part do not trust the news media. Just like the lunatic left, the media also lacks self-awareness",rigorousthinker,2025-04-18T14:00:42,8
