I was just following what you said up with that. Saying he's the enemy of the people hopefully wouldn't be the same as being ok with that? Because there have been instances where teslas are blown up,EntertainmentOk1882,2025-04-21T22:21:09,-11

"I‚Äôm someone different than the person you replied to but, yeah, the point is that there‚Äôs no reason to assume that that‚Äôs what the vast majority of people who espouse that view of Musk are in support of. There‚Äôs always going to be shitty people who take any opportunity they can to indulge their violent, destructive, anti-social tendencies, and those should be treated as shitty people doing shitty things, not as something the general Dem collective condones. It happens every time too, it wasn‚Äôt that long ago that the BLM movement was being unfairly conflated with the dipshits looting stores and starting fires.   I also find it interesting that Dems are the only ones expected to self-police in this way. The MAGA crowd pull shit like Jan 6th and the response from that base is somewhere between ‚Äòthat wasn‚Äôt us‚Äô and ‚Äòthey were right,‚Äô but I guess we all better watch what we say about Musk because a few morons are vandalizing Teslas.  Sorry, I know that‚Äôs not what you were trying to imply, but the fact that you even have to ask is super annoying; not specifically to you, but in the way this pattern persists in the general consciousness.",pegg2,2025-04-21T22:37:54,11
So what? Blow them all up! Torch the fucks! Obviously the ones still owned by Tesla. Don‚Äôt be burning up some poor schlubs vehicle. They got to get to work n feed their families.. but.. if people want to vandalize some billionaires corporate offices n products.. go ahead! That‚Äôs vandalism.     I won‚Äôt be doing shit. I‚Äôm disabled so I won‚Äôt be protesting or vandalizing anything.. I‚Äôm lucky if I can get to the bathroom before I mess myself half the time..  I‚Äôm just scared to death my Medicare or disability will get stolen by these assholes before I get my hip replacement and can work again..  it‚Äôs been 8 long years and I‚Äôm so close!!,Ironworker76_,2025-04-22T00:07:36,5
"You replied to someone that isn't me. Different conversation, so I wouldn't apply the ""you said"" to them. They weren't the ones who made the statement. I am.  And yes. A Trump supporter blew his cyber truck up in a statement, sure. Not sure of any others being blown up. I looked for them. Didn't find that specifically. We have what, maybe a dozen set on fire in the US to date? By maga standards, that's patriotic. By mine, it's nothing but vandalism that doesn't affect change.  Those vehicles have nothing to do with my point, though. See, I don't give two fucking kangaroo court ordered fucks about how much he cries over the consequences of his own actions. He did it to himself and doesn't care who it hurts. So, I don't care how much it hurts his feelings. He's skuM.",BluXombie,2025-04-22T00:26:46,1

Violence is never the answer. Period.,EntertainmentOk1882,2025-04-22T00:24:05,-3
"I mean, I wouldn‚Äôt say NEVER. If (and it‚Äôs a big if even now) the situation comes to the point that our institutions no longer function at all, and our democracy is well and truly dead, and we‚Äôre met with an authoritarian dictatorship that supplants the constitution and the rule of law, then an armed revolt might well be the last option. In that scenario, violence is the only answer.  I think the more correct thing to say is that random, unorganized, SYMBOLIC violence is never the answer. Violence should never be used as a method for expressing civil dissent.",pegg2,2025-04-22T00:46:35,2
