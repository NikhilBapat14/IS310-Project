Maybe should have fought back a little harder as he’s been consolidating power for years. Thrown him in jail on Jan 7th. Barred him from running for office. They had a the power & did nothing. It’s too late now. He’s got the whole game in his favor m.,ShinePretend3772,2025-04-23T18:31:25,18
"Power is not machismo, it's actual ability to drive positive results. As our CEO president, you'd expect as much. We're observing here someone good at failure. If you wrote a book on how to fuck everything, business or country this guy's play book is how to do it. Its so obvious it makes me think its 100% on purpose",katiescasey,2025-04-23T18:41:18,6

"”Participants were asked to react to the statement: “It's okay for a U.S. president to withhold funding from universities if the president doesn’t agree with how the university is run."" Fifty-seven percent disagreed”  So 43% agreed that it is OK for Trump to on his own withdraw funding from any universities he himself dislikes.",fabe1haft,2025-04-23T23:33:28,3

"I wonder what history will show, one century later than today, when everyone on this thread is gone; about this era in America’s life. Will we still be the same America? Will this great country be ruled by the ultra wealthy? Will they begin to eat their own? Or will we return to normalcy, to democracy?",UUUstupi,2025-04-23T21:40:35,1
"Yea that would solve the symptom and not the problem. The problem is that way, way too many support the guy or at least don't want to remove him out of fear or a warped admiration.    If the system is to be fixed, unfortunately, it may have to be due to Trump ruining his own reputation. It sucks, but the monster is so big it needs to kill itself. How long that will take I don't know, but if we really believe that he can't do this then he can't hold onto his influence forever and when that dies is when the need to take control is at hand.",Ok-Excuse1771,2025-04-23T18:51:37,6
"Observing from the outside, your country has at least three separate factions taking advantage of your inept orange-in-chief:   - Wealthy wackadoo Christians who want to turn the country into a white authoritarian theocracy, - Extremely wealthy people (whales) who know that creating instability offers a chance to generate wealth and who are just stripping you down for dollars and parts, and - Wackadoo billionaires itching to tear the country apart so they can remake it according to their cyberpunk wet dreams.  Not all of it's on purpose, but it's all serving _a_ purpose. Often more than one.",shellfish-allegory,2025-04-23T19:08:01,7

"It's the truth, a CEO has to be a good decision maker or they get fired (like them or not). This guy is taking advice from so many people, having no vision or fucking clue of his own, that it's a big cluster fuck. I feel in his first administration they were all aligned to a shitty vision at least, this is just to your point a bunch of cooks in the kitchen on their first day on the job",katiescasey,2025-04-23T19:12:51,3

"First administration started with a cadre of experienced old guard Republicans and professionals. Trump gradually fired them and replaced them with yes men ergo the massive chaos and unpopularity by the end of the first admin as the relatively competent and in many cases more moderate Republicans were fired in exchange for incompetents and extreme right figures. This time around they started with the incompetents and radical right wingers. I would argue there is more vision this time around (as the Navarro crowd have a vision with their tariffs and heritage foundation very much is the vision they are pushing) but that they are incredibly incompetent in terms of who is running things to be able to do any major push toward their goals (which are unpopular goals as well) so they have thus managed to ruin their image and popularity a lot faster than in the first term even with some of the MAGA folks who are being hurt by their policies. Frankly, the handful of competent people like Bessent or Rubio (competent not necessarily good people or representing good views) are having to fight against all the Peter Navarros, Hegeseths, etc... who hold Trump's ear so thus the swinging back and forth on insane policies to just bad policies.",cjh42,2025-04-23T22:57:00,2
