"This would be a terrible move, and Powell is only 1/12th of the vote.  So this would just destroy confidence in their independence, crash markets, and still not even get Trump reduced interest rates.  He would need to replace multiple members.  Zero support for this.",SetOk6462,2025-04-19T07:15:57,1245
It’s not Powell’s job to try and bail Trump out of the tariff wars. You can’t hate Powell(and I certainly don’t like him) but there is zero economic reasoning to cut interest rates right now with this uncertainty.   If Trump and his team would start announcing some signed deals with these “100s of countries” that want to negotiate he’d get the economic boom. Cutting interest would just about the worst thing to do right now.,EliteJassassin101,2025-04-19T11:55:02,325

"**From The Telegraph's Senior Business Reporter, Daniel Woolfson:**  Donald Trump is assessing whether he can [sack the head of the Federal Reserve](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/04/17/jerome-powell-untouchable-fed-chief-burst-trump-bubble/), the White House has said.  Kevin Hassett, Trump’s economic adviser, said on Friday that the president and his team were looking at whether he had the authority to remove Jerome Powell.  “The president and his team will continue to study that matter,” Mr Hassett told reporters at the White House when asked if sacking the Fed chairman was an option.  Investors and economists said axing Mr Powell would destabilise debt markets and could spark a funding crisis in the US, amid fears about the independence of the central bank.  The knock-on effects would be felt globally, as US debt is used as a crucial benchmark for financial products around the world.  Bilal Hafeez, chief executive of Macro Hive, which provides investment research, said: “It would be a huge, huge shock. Overall, it would almost be like an apocalyptic scenario for the market.”  Krishna Guha, at investment bank Evercore, said sacking Mr Powell would trigger market moves “likely guaranteeing recession”.  He added: “It would also materially increase the currently low but not trivial risk that the tariff crisis morphs into a Liz Truss-style fiscal crisis via a global buyers’ strike in the treasury market.”  Stock and bond markets in the US and Europe were closed on Friday, meaning any investor response to Mr Hassett’s comments will not come until next week.  Fears are growing that Mr Trump could move against the Fed chairman after he said on Thursday [that his “termination cannot come fast enough”](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/04/17/donald-trump-tariffs-latest-ftse-100-gold-ecb-interest-rate/). Reports suggest the US president has privately discussed sacking Mr Powell and floated a possible candidate to replace him.  Mr Hafeez said US borrowing costs would surge and the bond market could freeze up if the president took such action.  He said: “What could happen is, in \[bond\] auctions, people could just step back and say, ‘look, we’re not going to buy the bonds’, which then means that the bond market is in effect frozen.  “Then the Fed could have to step in to buy bonds. They’ll have to reinstitute [quantitative easing](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/money-printing-prevent-global-market-meltdown-britain-ban/) to stabilise the market. But then that’s a vicious spiral.”     **Article Link:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/04/18/donald-trump-checking-if-he-can-sack-fed-chief-white-house/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/04/18/donald-trump-checking-if-he-can-sack-fed-chief-white-house/)",TheTelegraph,2025-04-19T03:34:46,121
"Trump needs to improve at differentiating where he needs revolution, major reform, or slight touch ups. The Fed is in the last category, it’s one of our highest standards and well run effective organizations.   When I think about where I feel he’s winning most it’s when he started with the premise that matched the problem - he’s mostly choosing revolution and major reform but sometimes it’s major reform and not revolution or touch ups/leadership change not major reform or revolution. Fed independence and process is a keystone of our reserve currency status…",Unlucky-Prize,2025-04-19T09:12:18,159

"The Chairman of the Federal Reserve is appointed  by the President. It goes through the same process that any other appointed position by President for the most part.

"[Current US Inflation Rates: 2000-2025](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/)  Just looking at March, under Trump it was 2.4, 2.4, 1,9, 1.5 first time around.  Under Biden's Marches it was 2.6, 8.5, 5.0, and 3.5.  2025 it was down to 2.4, which was down from 2.8 his first full month.  He inherited 3.0.  The current rate is the lowest it has been since Feburary of 2021.  >Mr Pres, you haven't decreased inflation like you promised yet, and have actually caused prices to increase on many products.

They can independently decide to bail out private industries at the expenses of the tax payers. They have no obligation to be transparent so they can do whatever they want however they want without accountability. And their ability to generate cash out of nowhere is inherently dangerous and has lead to uncontrolled inflation.   Idk if I agree with disbandment but those are convicting points. Bailing out the corrupt financial housing authorities during 2008 was reason enough for radical change to the Fed’s power.,Condhor,2025-04-19T18:45:06,-10
"Previous precedent has understood that the “for cause” stands for misconduct or incapacity, not because of policy disagreements or “because I don’t like him.” This will likely go to SCOTUS.

If policy is not working for the American People then that is for cause in my opinion.  If the head of some agency is doing things under the previous administration that are contrary to the good of the Citizens then that in my opinion is CAUSE.
