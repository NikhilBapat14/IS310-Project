"I don't think I can support US intervention in Nigeria but not Ukraine without being a hypocrite, especially since caving Russia's face in has much more strategic value than getting involved with backwards religionists in a conflict we'll inevitably lose due to our own ROEs.  But I *do* think this is the leadership role the Catholic Church should absolutely fill. Declare a crusade, form an army of the faithful (or even just the willing), and go do God's bloody work. They absolutely have the financial means to get it done.",Alpha-Sierra-Charlie,2025-04-20T11:27:54,83

"The slaughter has been going on for a quarter century. It began in the northern city of Kano as Christians were killed by the thousands in modern day pogroms. The killing spread to surrounding areas of the north where the Christians were religiously ""cleansed"". Now, the killing has expanded to what Nigerians call the ""middle belt"". How long before Nigerian Christians are confined to coastal cities like Lagos?  And amidst the slaughter during his presidency, Barak Obama parroted the grotesque liberal media fallacy that this all was just a ""conflict between herders over grazing rights"". ANYTHING to avoid shining the light of day on the Islamic hatred and intolerance towards non-Muslims!  Unless they are a tiny, powerless minority, Muslims seem to be incapable of living in peace with their non-Muslim neighbors. We see this all over Africa (Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, Congo, Mozambique, the Sahel, West Africa, etc), on the Indian sub-Continent (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh), in Myanmar, Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, etc., etc.  Why is this? No one dares to ask. Merely asking risks bringing down the torrent of ""Islamophobia"" accusations from Muslims and their leftist water-carriers.  The answer is simple: Muslims are emulating the behavior of their Prophet, whose violence ethnically cleansed the Jews and all non-believers from Arabia. This is the problem that distinguishes Islam from all other major religions. For example, Christians often act violently and intolerantly....but they do so *in contravention* to the teachings and example of Jesus. When Muslims act violently and intolerantly, they do so *in compliance* with the teachings and example of Muhammad.",Vessarionovich,2025-04-20T08:21:07,39
