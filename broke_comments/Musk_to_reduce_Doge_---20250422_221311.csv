Too late after pissing off your customer base,Faucet860,2025-04-22T22:17:47,18
"This isnâ€™t about Tesla tanking, what Musk will get out of those juicy government contracts and being pals with Trump will keep him going. This is about his ego. He is sick of people mocking him, and hating him. Tesla is tied to his ego so he sees attacks on the company and individual vehicles as a personal attack. But itâ€™s too late. You canâ€™t wade into the political pool without having permanent political stink attached to you. Trump has it and always will - there will always be people who hate him.   Furthermore, you canâ€™t act like a fascist piece of shit and get that rancid stench off you. Sorry, Muskrat, itâ€™s permanent. You will never reach your former popularity - and it wasnâ€™t that great to begin with. Tesla wonâ€™t recover from this, especially if youâ€™re at the helm. Fuck around, find out.",BlackCaaaaat,2025-04-22T22:33:40,17
"The damage to Tesla, much like the damage inflicted upon our federal government, is done. He canâ€™t resurrect the brand without sacrificing himself and we all know thatâ€™s a nonstarter for this colossal narcissist.",Darth_vaborbactam,2025-04-22T22:23:53,15
Heâ€™ll still be a fascist.,restore_democracy,2025-04-22T22:34:27,9
He dismantled every agency investigating him. Then set it up for space x to get all upcoming contracts even ones already awarded to someone else.  His work there is done. ðŸ™„,theonlyglypher,2025-04-22T22:49:39,5
Karma will be this Doge thing destroying his company the way he destroyed many people's lives,Slow_Inevitable_4172,2025-04-22T22:24:11,4
"Elon did to Tesla the same thing that a certain german chancellor did to the name ""Adolf"".  There's no coming back for it at this point.",Leather-Matter-5357,2025-04-23T00:30:00,3
So Tesla is more important than eliminating corruption. Nice,EmilioNoCaprio,2025-04-22T23:21:57,2
Iâ€™m sorry but I just do not believe him. He may be less loud about it but I doubt all of this.,buggybugoot,2025-04-23T10:13:12,2
You don't get to opt out of being a nazi for financial reasons   Once you parade around doing nazi salutes your always going to be the nazi guy,skeptolojist,2025-04-23T02:17:58,1
Musk is a terrorist,Stargrund,2025-04-23T02:44:59,1
Most stupid businessman ever lived aside from Trump is Elon Musk.,reddittorbrigade,2025-04-23T04:57:31,1
Yeah he honestly doesn't seem to understand why people hate him.  It's like he doesn't realise that he's been sanitised by PR up until now but since he's stepped into the spotlight we've seen tha man behind it and realised he's literally continuing his [grandfathers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_N._Haldeman) legacy of being an absolute disgrace to the human race.,Mein_Bergkamp,2025-04-22T22:36:44,7
It was never about eliminating corruption - it was about making himself the beneficiary of corruption.,Truthisnotallowed,2025-04-22T23:56:40,3
"> Yeah he honestly doesn't seem to understand why people hate him.   Heâ€™s a malignant narcissist, heâ€™s probably genuinely surprised. The even bigger narcissist, Trump, is used to it. He has his devoted followers to fall back on. Musk doesnâ€™t - his devoted followers are a much smaller group. He would have lost a lot of followers when he decided to go full MAGA.",BlackCaaaaat,2025-04-22T22:42:10,5
"> The even bigger narcissist, Trump, is used to it.  Nah, Trump has never had a 'find out' phase and I'm utterly certain that the US people, republicans and democrats together do not have the collective spine to take him down while he is still alive, although *everyone* will of course be first in line to say how awful he was once he's dead.",Mein_Bergkamp,2025-04-22T22:44:59,3

Just imagine what will be written about him. Guaranteed he's on every worst president in history list,Major-Counter-585,2025-04-23T01:53:03,1
