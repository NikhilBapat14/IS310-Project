"Morin was raped and murdered by Victor Antonio Martinez Hernandez, an illegal alien from El Salvador, on August 5, 2023. It was a brutal crime, and Patty Morin, Rachel’s mother, was the guest at the White House, who graphically detailed how her daughter was killed by this animal who shouldn’t have been here and was allowed to roam at will, thanks to the incompetent policies under Joe Biden.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-16T17:09:17,141
"I am surprised at the resolve of the public and the lackluster attempts of the Dems/Media to shame and emotionally manipulate the people surrounding the immigration crisis.  Before the election I had stated many times that I was concerned that the average American public didn’t have the courage to follow through with the drastic measures that are required. I am happy to say that I was wrong, at least for now.  I will also say the opposition attempts to turn the narrative have been very weak as well. I fully expected an all out media blitz on this issue with Elian Gonzalez style photos on the news and internet 24/7. It may have been Trump’s re-election and subsequent flurry of executive action that has truly demoralized the Left.",Far-prophet,2025-04-16T18:17:43,39

"This situation and others like it where innocent people, overwhelmingly women and young girls, were murdered and raped by illegal immigrants who entered this country under the deliberate loosening of immigration enforcement policies under the Biden administration is why I no longer consider speaking to people who still attempt to support his policies. Up until just a few months ago, I was still hopeful that there was some dialogue to be had with hard-core leftists who hate Trump for no real reason. Up until just a few months ago I was still attempting self deprecating humor, and the “yeah you’ve got a point, he did say that. I hear you. But have you considered people voted for him because of Biden’s unnecessary policy about…” type discussions looking to bridge the gap. No more. I am done. If you long for Joe Biden’s policies and do not even acknowledge the blatant deliberate destructive policies his administration implemented in the name of enforcing power by bringing in voters, I have nothing to say to you.  Leftists and people like them are the actual modern-day nazis and fascists. They are dangerous. And they must never, ever return to power.",alrightbudgoodluck,2025-04-16T22:00:32,16
Her testimony was crushing for me to listen to. I wanted to turn it off but felt compelled to know the true gravity.,Beer_Kicker,2025-04-16T19:44:51,36
"Their new coalition is useless when it comes to organizing protest against mass deportation. Broadly, they collapsed in support among young men. Their most loyal young male demographic (black men) typically doesn't care about mass deportation, or vaguely supports it.  Look at the anti-Iraq War rallies, even look at the Occupy Wall Street rallies, and then look at the anti-Trump rallies now. Where are all the young men? They need young men at these rallies and we aren't there.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-16T21:53:21,12

"It was more depressing than that- I just realized that these people who really do support the Biden policies and oppose a return to public safety and common sense are broken, and there are a lot of them… It’s concerning. It’s the way they think… They are dangerous people and they are not showing any sign of learning from their previous actions these past 12 months…",alrightbudgoodluck,2025-04-17T03:13:49,7
