"The man put massive tariffs on steel imports and then turned around and canceled grants given to domestic steel manufacturers in his VP's home state, grants meant to help build new factories and train new employees.

I work as an industrial mechanic apprentice in the greater Cleveland area. Factories are struggling to get needed talent. Maintenance and die makers often require schooling and factories can’t fill these positions. Some factories have specialized skills needed for machine operators that aren’t quick to learn. I used to run flexo machines. I’ve gotten interview requests from companies across the country because it’s a rare skill apparently.,CommanderMandalore,2025-04-22T15:36:01,1
