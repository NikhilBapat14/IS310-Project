Science? This administration? Trump does science by instinct and RFK seems to be doing it by reading chicken bones. Science is about uncovering objective reality but these people manufacture their own.,YoungestDonkey,2025-04-24T18:43:57,1
"I didn't know the brainworms were ever interested in science, they have their agenda and they are working on it.  I see they are playing the long game to removing all  worm medication on the market.",LegitimatelisedSoil,2025-04-24T18:44:40,1

">Kennedy, who has no scientific or medical training himself, also seems confused about what a scientifically rigorous investigation would entail—and how long it might take.  I've been reading about the Dunning-Kruger effect.  If someone who has little experience or knowledge about a certain field of study, they tend to overestimate their own ability to master a subject.  RFK Jr. should be the poster boy for the concept.",KapahuluBiz,2025-04-24T19:23:44,1
Apparently science is good…but only if it proves what we want it to prove.   Seems legit.,BannedForEternity42,2025-04-24T21:05:18,1
This admin wants diversity in science.   The scientific method is so last century.  They would like to introduce alternative science.,grasshopper239,2025-04-24T20:57:01,1
He’s not doing science. He’s forcing the answer he wants. Claim that autism is caused by vaccinations. Reduce vaccination rates. Start a watch list for anyone with autism. No one registers for the watch list because why would they? Then he declares that he fixed autism.,Lysol3435,2025-04-24T21:10:14,1

Trump, America is back - leveraging environmental policies rooted in reality to promote economic growth while maintaining the standards that have afforded Americans the cleanest air and water in the world for generations.   >Unlike the previous administration, which wasted billions of taxpayer dollars on virtue signaling and ineffective grifts, the Trump Administration's policies are rooted in the belief that Americans are the best stewards of our vast natural resources - no ""Green New Scam"" required.",justanaccountimade1,2025-04-24T18:58:46,1

"Sorry for a second comment, but I can't help myself after reading it aloud.  Language of that release is breathtakingly unprofessional. ""Unlike the previous administration,  which wasted  billions dollars on a virtue signaling and ineffective grifts,,,""  "" 'no 'Green New Scam' "" ?!  Has any administration ever released an announcement with such immature grievance-speak?",spamattacker,2025-04-24T19:49:35,1

"If young adults  believe this, I am sad to see how little the attempts of our public schools to help students develop critical thinking skills.   That started well over 25 years ago, and I know the since then, they've tried to teach net-savy critical reding skills",spamattacker,2025-04-24T19:34:06,1
"My god, they actually used the term “grifts” to refer to Democrats unironically. They truly have no self awareness, do they?",stickyfan1230,2025-04-24T19:48:34,1
"It’s like when you can tell someone just learned a new word and they start using it constantly even when it doesn’t fit. Some of Trumps new words are “grift” and “insurrection.”  No but really, he is specifically using words that have been used to describe his own actions and is starting to misapply them so that it devalues their meaning to his base (to the extent that his base ever knew those words in the first place, which given their average reading level I am doubtful of)",dogmotherhood,2025-04-24T20:40:55,1
