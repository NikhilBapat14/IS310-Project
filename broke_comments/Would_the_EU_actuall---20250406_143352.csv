Here is the problem. The EU is hoping our congress will stop this and they are trying not to exacerbate the situation any more. Once their patience has run thin they will hit us with a hammer that will mess our world up.   See the EU is a bigger economy than the United States and China does about 550b worth of trade with the EU and only 505 with the USA. The EU and China could easily work out a nice trade agreement and fuck us six ways to Sunday and yes it would be rough but nothing like the catastrophic collapse that would happen here.   If that weren't bad enough China recently had its equivalent of an internal trade meeting to discuss what they would be willing to do IF tariffs were levied by the USA. One of the things on the list of things they would be willing to do is eliminate all US IP rights. Meaning they can make anything and sell it regardless of who created it. MS Office for $20 bucks in Europe great! Disney lunchboxes all yours rest of the world. American companies wouldn't see a dime of it. What would that do to lets say Nike? or Apple?  Yeah this guys lit a fuse that can destroy us. There will be no going back. What do you think Trump does when that happens? WW3? The Japanese attacked us for not selling them steel... Copying our Iphone and selling it everywhere?,cknight13,2025-04-07T00:11:18,136
"If these tariffs don't get lifted soon it's not a question of would, it's a question of how.   The EU is always divided, always discussing with each other because every nations specific weak points have to be considered. Also tariffs hurt everyone and unlike wannabe Hitler EU politicians aren't in the business of wrecking their own economy for no good reason and without a plan so openly because they like to stay in power.  They will figure something out if Trump doesn't back down soon, no doubt claiming some dubious win.   Say what you will about the EU in every other aspect but in terms of trade the EU has always played hardball if necessary. Ask the Brits, they were the last ones to underestimate the capabilities of the EU. And the sentiment towards them was way nicer than it is towards Trump.",Alive-Ad-4382,2025-04-07T01:18:21,67
"The issue is that almost every nation within the EU runs a trade surplus with the US.  They sell the US their surplus output because US consumers are a.  Massive group of humans.  b.  relatively wealthy c.  Consumer based economy d.  avenue to get dollars for imports in other goods from other nations (reserve currency)   There are no alternatives for this function of the us consumer.  The EU will try to save face and make some concessions but trump wont care, the real prize is services.... Trump does not want the EU limiting access to the market for US financial or Social Media firms. (why you keep hearing about US issues with freedom of speech stuff in the EU.)

Stop buying US military hardware.  Move to the EU as the petrodollar.   Refuse to resupply US naval ships in EU ports.  Remove US troops from EU bases.  Remove US intelligence from Five Eyes.  That's just off the top of my head.

"I'm european and I would say we do not expect EU to do any kind of ""retaliation"" per se, even though we kind of feel stabbed in the back, but we europeans are kind of cold and calculating in a way.  For instance, the US dollar is very strong in international trade, EU could perhaps take this opportunity to strenghten the demand for international trade to be made in EUR even when a EU country is not involved - this would shift a lot of influence  towards EU.   So, retaliation, no, but also lay flat, nope.   But I would say EU is ready to be the responsible one here.",middlemanagment,2025-04-07T13:25:27,2
"As opposed to what? Without retaliatory tariffs, they don't have leverage to get concessions out of Trump, all they can really do is capitulate, which is a great way to get Trump to do it again the next time he wants something. By slapping tariffs on the US in response, it gives them ground to concede without actually giving anything up, and a demonstration that they are willing to stand their ground. There's some argument to be made for waiting before reciprocating, but they really can't give him an inch or he will take a mile.",Dracoson,2025-04-07T13:30:29,4

"No, they won't. The EU has always been a very indecisive organization because every time a pivotal decision needs to be made, the organization gets bogged down by internal disagreements and bureaucracy. The EU wants to act like a cohesive country but it can't because it's made up of sovereign countries.  The EU won't do anything. However, individual countries might. The most likely scenario is that European countries will proceed cautiously to see if congress will act to stop Trump. If they don't, then they will wait until the 2026 midterms to see if the Democrats win and stop Trump. If they don't then they will wait until 2028 until Trump's new successor comes into power to see if Trump is just a bad blip in American history or a permanent part of it. If it's the latter, then that's when the EU will move away from the US.",AVeryBadMon,2025-04-07T06:50:35,-2

A lot of those are non starters. You can't dictate how a information is disseminated in a country because you have different beliefs. Russia and China regulate social media access right now and the laws in those countries are different. You can't make a country follow your home countries laws just because the HQ is in New York. So you follow the laws.   For example Trump and others bitch about being able to sell our Food and Meat to the EU but they have strict rules on meat being treated with antibiotics and steroids. They have rules against GMO foods and food chemicals we don't. They don't have to change their regulations and standards just so we can sell our meat and food there. We have to produce food that meets their standards. Personally they are right. We shouldn't be eating all this crap and i dont blame them not wanting it in their country.   Trump and these companies just need to make stuff that meets the standards and follow the rules of the country they are selling in.... Just like we expect foreign companies when they sell stuff here.,cknight13,2025-04-08T00:03:42,2
"No EU nations are in Five Eyes now, so that would prove rather difficult.     As far as military hardware, that’s not an option—western Europe is low key panicking right now because they’ve given so many artillery shells to Ukraine that their own stocks are way below the oh shit level, and the have no way of replenishing the, without buying from the US. They’re trying to rebuild their own military industrial capacity, but that process is not cheap and it’s not quick either. Kicking out US troops or otherwise trying to force a reduction in US military presence is a nonstarter for that reason alone, and that’s before you get into things like the EU being wholly dependent upon the US for BMD.

"I think being the responsible one is the way to go. The news can follow what leaders say and how they talk about the US and Trump, but the real story will be how investments move to Europe over the US because of the lack of consistency in government. The Us is going to be a worse place for business due to lack of consistent government regulation, lack of investment in renewable energy and energy infrastructure, and due to corruption.   I think Europe has a very big opportunity here. At some point, the Trump administration will make US treasuries a less trusted invetsment vehicle. European bonds should replace T-bills as the world's safe place to invest.   For Europe to be successful they need to avoid austerity for now. For the next few years, ignore deficits but make good investments. As long as they are building manufacturing, defense, and infrastructure that will support future growth, the stability of European debt will let a bond market grow in Europe which can pay down current spending with future debt. This debt market is how the US got such a large economy.

He is the head not of ""the government"" but of the legislative branch of the US government, together with the Senate majority leader (currently John Thune).  A bill makes it through the House, and then it may or may not be rejected by the Senate.  If it makes it past the Senate, it may or may not be vetoed by the President, unless its threshold of votes was unusually high.  (A 'veto-proof majority.')  In other words, if it only just squeaks through, and the President doesn't like it, he can kill it.  Right now the situation is a tad bit extraordinary, for the following reasons:    1.  The Republicans, the party of the President, are in the majority in both the House and the Senate.  In other words, they control both houses of Congress.  The Democratic minority, for the most part, can't do *shiiiiiiiiiit.*  2.  Ordinarily, Congress would step in if the president were doing something extraordinarily stupid or heinous.  Trump, however, has unprecedented control over the congressional majorities.  The ones who aren't MAGA true believers are absolutely terrified of him.  He keeps their balls in his desk.  3.  This is because Trump has a talent for purging members of Congress who go against MAGA.  There were many congressional Republicans who stood against him during the early part of his first term.  They're all gone now.  4.  Therefore, Trump does not need to drive a bulldozer through Congress to get his way.  He simply drove the bulldozer around them.  He rules by Executive Order, a presidential tool that Obama was criticized for overusing (because of bitter congressional obstructionism).  Trump has taken that to the next level.  He now rules, essentially, by fiat.",ColossusOfChoads,2025-04-07T12:18:54,8

Wars have to be popular and most NATO allies do not have a population submissive enough to support a meaningless large scale conflict.

The same respect that soured public opinion on the intervention of every other armed conflict in the history of the alliance.

"Yes, here in Britain the nature of the president is what we find weird. It's a small difference but one that has giant implications: over here, our royalty has no real power, but all the pomp, ceremony and majesty is focused on them as the head of state. This leaves our prime minister to (in theory) be able to be boring and sober in running the country as the head of government.    In America, the president has both these roles. I remember being so dumbfounded when watching presidential elections and there being literal fireworks and WWE music as the candidates came to the stage. The symbolism, ego, fireworks, and for want of a better word, spirituality of the leadership is focused completely on the president, not an impartial and distant monarch.    This has some effects, I think. For one, it really makes a president act more like a king. And two, it makes him much harder to shake off if he's being tyrannical, both in terms of public support and in practice.    Our prime ministers are very important, but they don't have pure executive power and can be replaced without even a general election.

"I don't disagree with you. You're both correct that what Trump is doing is a betrayal and he's damaging our relationships with our allies.   I'm just point out two truths despite this reality:  1. The US-Europe relations will bounce back sooner or later. Did you forget what happened back after 9/11 when a bunch of European countries refused to go along with Bush's wars? It was also a chaotic time full of betrayal, threats, and global uncertainty. The alliance was very strained then, and many predicted that it was the end of NATO and the transatlantic alliance, but guess what? When Obama became president it bounced back and that rhetoric died down.  2. The EU as entity, as an organization is notorious for being weak. Every conflict, every decision, every policy shift always takes the EU way too long to act and the actions that do take place are incredibly watered down. Anytime a policy is proposed it has to go through a bunch of bureaucracy that kills a lot of time. Any time a policy is voted on there will always be a country like Austria or Hungary who will block the motion from passing. Every time the EU puts out a response that all members agree upon, it's usually just a strong worded letter.  Here's some examples of this:   * It took Romania and Bulgaria 13 years to join the Schengen zone despite being EU members since 2007 and meeting the requirements to join the Schengen since 2011. Every time, some country like the Netherlands or Austria vetoes them for no reason. It took them until this year to finally join.   * Same goes for Ukraine. The EU still has great difficulty passing any resolution regarding giving aid to Ukraine because Hungary vetoes the motion every damn time. Countries are forced to act individually instead of as a block because of it. This veto has singlehandedly killed the idea of a unified European army again and again.   * Yet another example would be Turkey, when it tried to strong arm Europe by threatening to flood the EU with immigrants, the EU's response was a strongly worded letter. When Turkey threatened to steal Greek islands, the EU put out another strongly worded letter. When Erdogan started rolling back rights and democracy in Turkey, the EU did what it does best and put out another strongly worded letter.    That's magical power of the EU, and now you're telling me this same organization is now stand up firmly against Trump? I just don't see it. The EU has history going back decades of inaction and weak responses, I don't see that suddenly changing now.

Any job that pays is a good job, but being able to manufacture some things is more important than others (weapons, energy, machinery vs toys, clothes, and makeup). Americans think that manufacturing jobs are good jobs because they used to be. Believe it or not, but the average American used to be able to support their family, buy a home, and go on vacation with a single income from working in a factory and work there for 40 years and retire with a pension and social security. Those jobs were sent elsewhere to maintain ""cheap"" costs of goods. We consume way too much anyway. The shipping away of those jobs bankrupted the entirety of middle America and many are upset about that.  Look I'm not arguing right or wrong or giving the answers, I'm just explaining to you what I've heard Americans who voted this way and feel this way have told me.",Doxjmon,2025-04-07T19:49:02,1
"> why are manufacturing jobs 'good' jobs  When our grandfathers were still in their prime, one of those jobs could get you the same exact lifestyle as Homer Simpson.  A detached single family home that's *huge* by European standards, a car in the garage, a wife raising three kids, etc.  Although maybe with a little less falling down the stairs or accidentally lighting yourself on fire.  'The Simpsons' is a bit of an anachronism in that regard.  Homer Simpson is the archetypal **mid-century** blue collar family man.  The Brits would call him 'working class' but most Americans would be like ""WTF are you talking about?  That's middle class!""  Granted, we go by a different definition of that term.   Al Bundy is another one.  That house, in a Chicago suburb, is probably worth over a million dollars today, and there'd be a Range Rover in the garage instead of a flat green shitbox with the muffler falling off.  But as late as the mid 1980s, a put-upon schlub like him had the same lifestyle as Homer Simpson.  At least on TV.  Trump's ~~working class~~ blue collar voters are trying to get back to what Homer Simpson has.",ColossusOfChoads,2025-04-08T02:24:48,1

"What is this ""that""?    Because most manufacturing won't be able to exist if it is not competitive compared with the rest of the world. I mean, if it doesn't sell outside of USA, it means that you are subsidizing a dinosaur. Gardening an entire economy with tariffs is going to work only in a schizophrenic's fantasy.   The other way around is not much better. Competing with other nations with lower production costs means: 1) lowering salary 2) deregulating and poisoning your environment  3) lowering the purchasing power of the dollar   So explain to me where is this ""gain"" found, by the people you mention?

"And I'm saying those Americans are wrong. The rich arent stealing from you by exporting jobs, they're stealing from you by making all the jobs in America suck and pay garbage. To bring the manufacturing you're talking about home, the average american will have to get poorer in terms of how many goods they can afford. Your current system of employing huge swathes of the world to extract resources and make stuff for you for litteral pennies per hour is making your country as a whole filthy rich, but none of it goes to the common man,. and you consistently elect governments that make it easier for them to do this.  Manufacturing jobs didnt allow you to do all those things, and I'm well aware that was all possible, because of some inherant virtue of being a manufacturing job. People making 40c an hour sewing your clothes in Vietnam arent getting to do all those things, and if those jobs come back under your current system they wont allow Americans to live this middle class lifestyle either, they'll just make sure that the Americans making tshirts for $10/hr cant afford the $100 tshirts they make, because the $5 tshirts at Walmart they can afford right now with their shitty job dont exist any more. The jobs of the past allowed that lifestyle because of labour protections. unionization, trust-busting monopolies and heavily progressive tax rates that were used to subsidize things like education heavily. And even with all that taken in to account in many ways those people of the past were much poorer. It's more expensive to buy a house or put your kids through college, but you can buy so many things so much cheaper.  You've broken your unions and dont form new ones. You've allowed monopolies and monopsonies to take over your economy. And you keep electing politicians that support this current vision of the economy.  As I said before, America consumes 25% of global production. There literally arent enough Americans to manufacture everything America consumes. American is 7th in nominal GDP per capita in the world, behind largely tiny places inhabited by only rich people. America is rich, and your global position in trade is a huge reason why, but so long as you let the super rich steal all the excess value from your society and fight against redistibuting it no other change will help you, certainly not destroying your position at the head of a global hegemony.",Illumidark,2025-04-07T20:30:54,1
"You cut off the 2nd half of my question there. It was an intentional comparison intended to ask the question why is one a good job and the other isnt, not simply what made one job good.   Putting aside that TV isn't real life and characters frequently have lives way outside what they could afford with the job they hold.   You're saying a manufacturing job is a good job because it could afford that kind of lifestyle. There are 12.7 million Americans working in manufacturing right as of 2023 [but the average wage in the sector is one of the lower averages by industry.](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t24.htm) Most of them aren't afforded that kind of lifestyle. The people working in overseas factories certainly aren't. There is nothing inherently special about a manufacturing job that means it will pay well, have benefits or a pension.   Your great-grandfathers walked picket lines and fought and bled for unions, overtime pay, minimum wage, health and safety standards and more, and they passed a society that had lower wealth inequality on to your grandparents. But since the 70s your country has been systematically defanging and breaking unions, lowering taxes on the rich while cutting redistribution programs aimed to boost you all and playing a shell game where they constantly tell you you are getting poorer because of some other group that's even poorer then you. In the 80s it was welfare queens, this decade it's foreigners, whether as immigrants or overseas workers. And all this time wealth inequality has grown, it's now worse then the gilded age, on par with dictatorships. You are 7th in the world for nominal gdp per capita but 143rd in the world for wealth inequality, but somehow it's supposed to be other poor people's fault that the rich are taking more and more from you every year.",Illumidark,2025-04-08T08:15:23,1

"The ""That"" is my 2nd paragraph in the comment before this one and the last.  The US economy is actually not that trade heavy with over 70-75% of it's GDP coming purely domestically. Also in order for the tarrifs to hurt the economy we'd have to lost a larger portion of business than the extra revenue it brings in so it's a lot more complicated than tarrifs good or tarrifs bad. If the US shut itself in and manufactured more US goods it would lower overall customer consumption (price increases) but money will still be circulating within the US economy instead of another countries. Not really pertaining to your points, but wanted to offer some insight on the US economy, trade, and it's global standing.  >Competing with other nations with lower production costs means: 1) lowering salary 2) deregulating and poisoning your environment  3) lowering the purchasing power of the dollar  Tarrifs make it so the US doesn't have to lower production costs, the tarrifs artificially raise other countries. Goods will just cost more. There's really not much to ""gain"" anymore. It's mostly nostalgia of the past that was robbed from them when jobs were shipped overseas.  Arguments against tarrifs: free trade is better, ruins trade relations if not done tactfully, easier to do business, keeps prices lower by exploiting low wages in other developing nations, tarrifs will disrupt markets and destabilize economies.  Arguments for tarrifs: source of national income, forces importers to pay a tax (since they actively avoid all others), incentivises local production of goods, incentives for employment of local workers and local economies, useful as a negotiating tool.",Doxjmon,2025-04-09T02:44:28,1
">The rich arent stealing from you by exporting jobs, they're stealing from you by making all the jobs in America suck and pay garbage  Both can be true. You actually mentioned that corporations destroyed unions using exporting of jobs as leverage.  >Your current system of employing huge swathes of the world to extract resources and make stuff for you for litteral pennies per hour is making your country as a whole filthy rich, but none of it goes to the common man  This is true. And also I'm against this. We don't need to consume as much as we do.  >Manufacturing jobs didnt allow you to do all those things, and I'm well aware that was all possible, because of some inherant virtue of being a manufacturing job.  Didn't say it was inherent to manufacturing jobs at all, just that manufacturing jobs were the main source of that to most middle Americans during post WW2.  >The jobs of the past allowed that lifestyle because of labour protections. unionization, trust-busting monopolies and heavily progressive tax rates that were used to subsidize things like education heavily.  Yes agreed. Labor unions lost tremendous power when the US allowed and incentivised firing them all for foreign workers getting paid pennies on the dollar. This also allowed companies to gain massive wealth quickly making it harder to fight against them and their lobbies.  >It's more expensive to buy a house or put your kids through college, but you can buy so many things so much cheaper.  It doesn't matter if things are cheaper if the two biggest life expenses have increased beyond attainability and the one avenue meant to allow for financial class mobility paralyzes you with massive debt and no longer functions as an effective tool to raise your class status (college).  >You've broken your unions and dont form new ones.

The US economy based on its GDP % of trade is roughly 26% meaning the US economy is 74% domestic.

That's China, they're the major trade partner with almost every other nation except the EU and North America. Our GDP actually comes mostly from domestic companies. We could be doing much better trade wise. Right now there are very few avenues to advocate for redistribution. The last person that wanted that was Bernie Sanders in 2016 and the Democratic Party canned him in the primaries and put up Hillary Clinton. Our government is corrupt and it's slow to change. Believe me we're trying. In fact Trump was the result of a populist movement against the political elite and the status quo (or at least a perceived idea).
