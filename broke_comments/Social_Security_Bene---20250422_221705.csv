">The SSA has already cut 7,000 positions—about 12 percent of its workforce. The reductions have caused delays in claim approvals and repeated service outages.  >At a town hall event on Monday hosted by Representatives Laura Gillen and Tom Suozzi, O'Malley detailed how the staffing changes have led to system instability. Gillen and Suozzi echoed O'Malley's concerns, with Suozzi questioning why ""you cut 7,000 employees to save 0.06 percent of the budget from one of the most important agencies?""

"I’m still not sure what you thought was “silly” about what I said, because you haven’t actually addressed my point. Social Security isn’t a personal savings account like the original commenter seemed to imply. There’s no individual pot of money with your name on it to cash out later. What you pay now goes to current retirees. That’s all I was trying to clarify.  Instead of engaging with that, you pivoted to something unrelated. Talking about hypotheticals, like redirecting capital gains taxes into the trust fund, doesn’t change how the system functions right now. And it’s not relevant to the point I was making. Social Security is funded by payroll taxes from current workers, and those funds are used to pay current retirees. That’s not an opinion, it’s how the program is structured. A lot of people mistakenly believe they’re paying into their own personal account for the future. They’re not.  And the stuff about full retirement age and delayed benefits isn’t word play. The system is designed to encourage people to delay collecting by offering higher monthly payments if they wait. That’s how the benefit formula works.  Again, none of this actually responds to what I said. Social Security doesn’t function like a personal account, and none of us have a balance building up.",Senior-Purchase-6961,2025-04-23T16:15:45,0

"I’m still not sure why you took issue with my original comment. I wish you’d expand on it.  You haven’t explained what part of it was wrong. I just described how the system works. Current workers fund current retirees.  You keep pivoting to unrelated points. I never brought up retirement age, so I’m not even sure why we’re talking about it. Sure, you can adjust what’s labeled as the “full” retirement age, but that doesn’t change the fact that the system offers more if you delay collecting. That’s just how the benefit formula is set up.  And saying benefits are based on what you paid in doesn’t mean the money was saved for you. It just helps determine what you qualify for.  If it really worked like a personal account, how do you explain people like my mom who have already collected more than they paid in? That money comes from today’s workers. That’s why it’s called Social Security.  The whole point I made, the one you thought was just sooo silly, is that the money is not saved in an account for you specifically. That’s what people usually think when they talk about “paying in” and “cashing out”.
