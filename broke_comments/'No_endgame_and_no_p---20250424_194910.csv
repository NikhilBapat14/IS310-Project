Does anyone actually think that Trump ever had a plan?  He reacts to things like a sugar addled 5 year old.   No plan beyond his initial emotional reaction.,killjoygrr,2025-04-24T19:55:27,1

"It’s a beautiful word! Tariffs…. Almost sounds like that redheaded step child of mine. Tiffany. No, no I don’t claim her either. Biden’s Tiffany is ruining the stock market! I will fix the prices of beautiful plastic eggs day one after I have been in office for 2.5-3 years! Bigily!",nopulsehere,2025-04-24T20:29:45,1

I'm pretty sure his plan has always been to steal the tariff money.,Purify5,2025-04-24T20:50:03,1
"The funny thing is that Trump could have won the trade war.  Trade with the United States *was* essential, and there *were\are* a bunch of countries willing to do almost anything for access to American Markets.  But... Vietnam capitulated immediately and agreed to give Trump whatever he wanted!  Only, Trump never asked for anything more and still tariffed Vietnam!  Canada and Japan both have sent delegates to figure out concessions they're willing to grant the United States and... there is NOBODY to negotiate with, and no concessions asked to remove those tariffs!  People are trying to give the United States a win, and Trump is refusing!    It seems like the tariffs **were the goal** with a weird, ONLY THE USA CAN PUT TARIFFS, NOBODY ELSE CAN mentality.",kia75,2025-04-24T21:47:40,1

"Nah. What you are seeing are actions to try to prevent immediate collapses of businesses.   What he is doing is the equivalent of sitting down at a chess match and just flipping the table over.   It screws everybody over, and what you are seeing are responsible leaders trying to reduce the immediate impact. Markets will adjust over time and they will not be to America’s favor, as tarriffs never really achieve that.",killjoygrr,2025-04-24T21:51:48,1
"""Do something or else I blow the both of us up"" is a shitty, but viable negotiation stance.  People did go out of their way to negotiate out of this shitty arrangement, and Trump could have gotten a lot from it.  It would have been temporarily, because once someone threatens to blow you up, you go out of your way to prevent that from happening, but at least in the short term, Trump could have gotten some useful deals and claimed a win.     Instead, Trump, after getting a bunch of potential concessions, decided to blow up everybody anyway, despite there being no benefit or way to win from the blow-up!",kia75,2025-04-24T22:49:58,1
