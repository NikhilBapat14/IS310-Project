This is a huge win. And an issue close to my heart.  My mother passed in my 20s. My father in my 30s.  Both after long battles with cancer.  The medicine alone wiped us out financially let alone radiation and chemo. I was the 24/7 care giver.  Thankfully I was able to help them.  The stress they had to endure on top of their health was a lot. No one should have to deal with that extra heartache.,bobaf,2025-04-15T21:35:26,5
"My wife who is a Surgical Tech and I have talked about this for awhile.  How many know that drugs just like books and music have a shelf life. Meaning that the patents only last X years. Then once the patent protection ends, other companies can make the same drug and most times sell it cheaper.  The hitch is, when a drug is close to having the patent end, suddenly some deadly or severe side effect is found and it has to be taken off the market. THEN a new drug, using ALMOST the same exact formula but with only a slightly different content of chemicals so it can be a NEW patent and get protection. This allows them to NEVER have any competing generic drugs and lets them keep the prices high.  This has been going on for several decades and even though it is obvious to the power that be, they allow it to happen.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-16T11:31:50,1
"Just for information sake. In Trumps first term he signed the Right to Try Act. This has helped many people.  The Right to Try Act, signed into federal law by President Donald J. Trump on May 30, 2018, allows terminally ill patients to request access to experimental drugs that have completed Phase 1 clinical trials but are not yet approved by the FDA, provided they have exhausted all approved treatment options and are unable to participate in clinical trials",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-16T11:32:56,2
