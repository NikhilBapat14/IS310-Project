"Always great to see trump losing but this is one of those where no one wins. I’m not a fan of “congestion tolls” I think it’s just an extra tax to use the road, a road that is already built and maintained by local state taxes and fuel tax.",Peacefulgamer2023,2025-04-24T13:15:46,-13
"Except the majority population of New York City loves the plan and the statistics back up the plan as working so no, the actual residents of NYC win.",_not2na,2025-04-24T13:28:07,13
"> I think it’s just an extra tax to use the road  Yes, that is the entire point. One of the levers of power governments can use to influence behavior is a tax. In this case, New York was able to [decrease travel times between 10% on the low end at the Manhattan Bridge to 65% at the Holland Tunnell](https://lede-admin.nyc.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/48/2025/01/congestion-pricing-week-one-bridges-tunnels-1.jpg?w=710&quality=75) ([data pulled from here](https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-Bridges-Tunnels-Hourly-Traffic-Rates-2010-2025/qzve-kjga/about_data))  They removed 7.5% of cars from the roadways in the business district, decreased travel times significantly, funded public transit, reduced motor vehicle collisions, etc.  Sometimes there are other reasons to use a ""stick"" in policy besides just maintenance for the roadway. Especially when most of the users that are causing the wear and tear on the roadways don't actually live in or pay taxes to the jurisdiction that collects them to maintain the roads.",Areyounobody__Too,2025-04-24T13:38:05,9
> it’s just an extra tax to use the road  That's a toll. Which is not what congestion pricing is. So...,Grandpa_No,2025-04-24T13:25:40,6
"New York loves high taxes in general, I’m more worried about the precedent it leads to when it comes to other roads in other areas . Why stop at just congestion?  Why shouldn’t all roads have increase cost to drive on?  Wanna drive on 95? Sure but you better be prepared to pay tolls for each county you drive through!",Peacefulgamer2023,2025-04-24T13:31:14,-9
"Do you not pay an extra fee to use the road?  That is a toll, and basically another tax….",Peacefulgamer2023,2025-04-24T13:27:12,-1

You're yammering dude. Can you try and make a point instead of just yapping with bad grammar?,_not2na,2025-04-24T14:19:49,2
More taxes hurt poor American than it does rich Americans.,Peacefulgamer2023,2025-04-24T15:15:08,1

"New York is 13th in the ranking of HDI among the 50 states, so they're not doing too bad in terms of quality of life.  I'd rather be poor in New York than in Alabama.",NinjaLanternShark,2025-04-24T15:25:39,1
"Poor is still poor, I’d rather have people being able to live comfortably and invest so when they are in their 60 and 70s they are not depending on social security to stop them from becoming homeless and living on the streets.",Peacefulgamer2023,2025-04-24T15:28:43,1
