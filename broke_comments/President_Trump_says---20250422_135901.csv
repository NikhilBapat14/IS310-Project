5 bucks says this is cancelled.,Taint_Liquor,2025-04-22T14:01:47,20
Probably one of the few schools in the country that would even consider having him. Most likely his team reached out to that school and asked if he could.,Constant_Affect7774,2025-04-22T14:04:42,9
Poor University of Alabama. I guess everyone of note was busy that day.,hamsterfolly,2025-04-22T14:03:16,9
It can’t be as bad as when he spent his Coast Guard commencement complaining about how mean everyone was to him a week after he fired Jim Comey.,ScotTheDuck,2025-04-22T14:04:56,7
"This can't end well. Sure, Alabama would be one of the more friendlier public universities for Trump to give a keynote. He'll get a better welcome there than Cal, for sure, but I'd still expect a protest, possibly something leading to violence when some good ol' Boys take umbrage with the protesters.  Of course, that could be part of the allure for Trump. He could use it to keep going after colleges.",travio,2025-04-22T14:10:56,6

"It's going to be yet another rambling, incoherent 'weave' of nothing but complaints and vitriol, he'll shit himself halfway through, then be escorted back to his plane full of sycophants who'll pat him on the head and tell him that his mouth diarrhea ""changed those kids' lives.""",simiangeek,2025-04-22T14:48:28,2

Not really the point - the point is that people who go to college or are in college tend to lean more left. Even Republicans in college are often more center than hard right.,niltermini,2025-04-22T19:05:12,1
