">The outlooks for the U.S. and global economies have significantly worsened in the wake of [President Donald Trump's tariffs](https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-liberation-day-2a031b3c16120a5672a6ddd01da09933) and the uncertainty they have created, the International Monetary Fund said Tuesday.  >The IMF said that the global economy will grow just 2.8% this year, down from its forecast in January of 3.3%, according to its latest World Economic Outlook. And in 2026, global growth will be 3%, the fund predicts, also below its previous 3.3% estimate.  >U.S. economic growth will come in at just 1.8% this year, down sharply from its previous forecast of 2.7% and a full percentage point below its 2024 expansion. The IMF doesn't [expect](https://apnews.com/article/global-economy-tariffs-imf-d15febaaaab65c7df8538cce170231eb) a U.S. [recession](https://apnews.com/article/recession-tariffs-economy-inflation-5a24ff198dcd6813b53f44c662354b6a), though it has raised its odds of one this year from 25% to 37%.  >The forecasts are largely in line with many private-sector economists' expectations, though some do fear a recession is increasingly likely. Economists at JPMorgan say the chances of a U.S. recession are now 60%. The Federal Reserve has also forecast that growth will weaken this year, to 1.7%.",YesterShill,2025-04-22T10:05:46,0
