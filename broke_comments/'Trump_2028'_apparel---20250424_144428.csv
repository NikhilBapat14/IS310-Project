">The listing for the hats marked them as being on sale for $50 and included a description that read, ""The future looks bright! Rewrite the rules with the Trump 2028 high crown hat. Fully embroidered with a snap closure in the back, this will become your new go-to hat."" [The shirts,](https://www.trumpstore.com/product/trump-2028-shirt/?attribute_pa_size=small&attribute_pa_color=red) listed for $36 each, feature a “Trump 2028” slogan and the phrase “Rewrite the Rules.”  So trump and his supporters know that trump remaining in office past his term is against the rules, but they want to rewrite those rules. Okay then.  >In response to a request for comment, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt referred NBC News to the Trump Organization “since it’s their website,” adding, “but it’s a cool hat and I suspect it will be highly popular!”  I bet it will be! The tactic here is to get trump supporters used to the idea of ""trump 2028"" way ahead of time. Once they're used to that thought, they're not going to take it well whenever someone tries to explain that it's against the Constitution. They'll feel like you're taking something away from them that they're rightfully entitled to.  If you think ""No way. trump won't actually stay in office past his term. That's not allowed. That can't happen."" Please don't assume it can't happen. Take it seriously. If you assume it can't happen, you won't be prepared when it does.",sachiprecious,2025-04-24T14:53:47,21

"Has anyone, who is against Trump and MAGA, though that he’s trolling his haters so hard? Like so hard. MAGA people are constitutional lovers same with Trump.   The Swamp has convinced people for years, with the help of the main stream media, that he’s hitler and a Nazi. If he were those things he would have done what he could to make that happen in his 1st term. If you watch his interviews in whole he is constantly joking and does it in a way that gets under the swamps skin so they made it get under MAGA haters skin.   Swamp hates Trump so they yell wolf. The main stream media barfs up the lies of the wolf to everyone and everyone believes the lie and have conditioned good people into think Trump is a wolf in sheep’s clothing when it is quite literally opposite.
