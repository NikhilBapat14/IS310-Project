"I don't understand the push to dismantle VOA. It is directly controlled by the US government, is not left-biased the way NPR (or BBC) are (independent review agencies like Media Bias / Fact Check and Allsides agree with me on this point), and it directly serves US interests. Dismantling it seems like it would weaken our influence internationally. It's a well-respected outlet that, for better or worse, can serve as a propaganda outlet to combat less-truthful propaganda from hostile states such as Russia and China, both of which have extensive, powerful propaganda machines (Xinhua, RT, TASS, etc.) To me it seems like money well-spent.  The total budget of USAGM, which is the umbrella for VOA and these other media agencies, is $886 million annually. That's close to 1/1000th the total defense budget. And I do see VOA and USAGM more broadly as part of defense spending, and a type of spending that can potentially reduce the need for other, more costly actions. It's always cheaper to win the information war and then not have to engage with actual troops, or to prevent something that would have caused economic damage. And the world nowadays is so interconnected that I can't imagine the US's budget bottom line losing big if we don't have our own effective, respected propaganda outlet.  Can someone explain this to me?",cazort2,2025-04-23T16:13:48,27
It will be overturned. It always is overturned. Just looking for publicity and attention.,Lifeisagreatteacher,2025-04-23T18:37:21,6
