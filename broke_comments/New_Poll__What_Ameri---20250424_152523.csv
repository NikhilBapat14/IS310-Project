Trump raised my taxes during his first term and now wants to make those tax increases permanent. There’s nothing amazing about that.,ranchoparksteve,2025-04-24T15:29:54,1

>***But Americans are not well informed about what the federal government spends money on.***  >Only 17% know that Social Security is the largest federal spending program.  How many times does it need to be stated that Social Security does not contribute to the national debt?,oldtrenzalore,2025-04-24T15:39:47,1

">Respondents systematically underestimate the tax burden on high-income earners, with 73% proposing maximum tax rates that are actually lower than what high earners currently pay, while simultaneously overestimating top earners' share of total income.  The vast majority of people probably don't know enough about economics and taxation levels to give exact numbers, including me.  But I do know that income gap between the wealthy and everyone else has increased a lot since the 70s.  Incomes among the poor have been stagnant, but the cost of housing has gone up.",crusafontia,2025-04-24T15:55:24,1
"Hoover Institution. Named after the economic genius who brought us the Great Depression. They serve wealth, not the economy. Ragging on SS right out of the gate shows the spin they are trying to sell.",barneyrubbble,2025-04-24T16:23:39,1
"A new poll from the Hoover Institution’s [Fiscal Policy Initiative](https://www.hoover.org/research-teams/fiscal-policy-initiative) asked 1,775 members of the American public about their attitudes toward the extension of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA, or the “Trump Tax Cuts”) currently being negotiated in Congress. Conducted with YouGov on April 4–10, 2025, the survey revealed that while Americans are worried about future federal debt and deficits, they have large gaps in knowledge about what the federal government spends money on and what is included in the extension of the 2017 TCJA that is currently being negotiated by Congress. Of those polled, 75% are concerned about the growing federal debt and believe Congress should prioritize deficit reduction, yet only 17% correctly identify Social Security as the largest federal spending program. Knowledge about the TCJA is remarkably low, with only 11% of respondents answering at least 7 of 10 questions about it correctly, and 54% getting only 3 or fewer questions right.",HooverInstitution,2025-04-24T15:25:52,1

"Me as well. No sympathy. His cult is super happy that someone with upper middle income gets an increase, so that the top .1% can save millions.",joetaxpayer,2025-04-24T15:36:52,1
>17% correctly identify Social Security as the largest federal spending program.  This has nothing to do with the debt. Connecting the two things is dishonest.,oldtrenzalore,2025-04-24T15:40:39,1
