"It's not a problem. The entire pentagon is against Hegseth, so what President Trump has decided is to get rid of the entire Pentagon and keep Secretary Hegseth. Therefore, starting Monday morning, Hegseth will carry out all the duties of the entire pentagon because everybody else will have been laid off, fired, or dismissed for poor performance on their jobs.",TopEagle4012,2025-04-23T06:46:45,39
"22,000 DoD employees against Hegseth as their leader. That's a lot of people to fire over one guy who should be in AA instead of the Pentagon. I guarantee more whisteblowers are going to come forward with more evidence against his security failures.",Financial-Special766,2025-04-23T07:41:53,23
"Why is it that when something bad happens and it's a woman or POC in charge, it's because they're incompetent and they only got the job because of DEI, but when a white man repeatedly fucks up the simplest of tasks, it's ok and everyone needs to just forget about it and move on?   I mean I know why. You'd just think the ""DEI is bad"" crowd would start to realize how fucking dumb they look, eventually.",IdkAbtAllThat,2025-04-23T09:06:42,16
At this point my dog is more reliable and qualified than Hegseth. She can hide her treats very well.,Justthetippliz,2025-04-23T06:56:34,11
"What are the chances his next set of signal chat texts have him using the n word with the hard ""r""?",Equivalent-Sun-4499,2025-04-23T07:08:29,5
"TBH is bigger than that, the Pentagon is already super annoyed by the whole DOGE craziness. Pentagon is big, which means is gonna be slow. You can't have a bunch of 20 years old coming in here and be like move fast and break things. And we gonna see even more re-org and layoff to make sure pentagon aligned with the president, which is not going to happen because the president is changing daily.",nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-04-23T07:22:28,6
"He is a safety risk, humans in the military might die due to him. Wouldn’t it be reasonable for the military to… I don’t know, just refuse include him in anything which makes it technically impossible for him to do his how, which eventually forces him out of office?  On the other hand, if you already oppose your incompetent and foreign controlled leadership, why stop at him…?!?",Xenobsidian,2025-04-23T08:02:54,3
"Meaning Hegseth will be ""asked"" to resign. Like being led into a room, and on the table he finds a gun or a katana. He'd already had the talk with Tom Hagen beforehand.  Trump will then never have had to admit to the mistake that is Hegseth, therefore.  e: grammar",steve_ample,2025-04-23T06:55:46,2

Not to worry he will get the boot because he is simply getting too much press. This takes up the air left in the room for Cheeto. He dun like that.,SingleRefrigerator45,2025-04-23T08:33:39,2
"I don't get it. Firing people is his favorite thing. Here we have a person demonstrating gross incompetence and mangling national security, a perfect candidate for termination, and Trump is sitting on his hands. Makes me wonder if there's someone in those group texts who they actually want classified info leaked to.",Ouibeaux,2025-04-23T08:54:12,2

Amazing that Republicans in the House and Senate think that this is a good man for the job. I guess we get what we vote for.,spicyshovel,2025-04-23T08:53:55,1
"""Disarray"" is just untidy.  The consequence that worries me is the impact on readiness.",Unique-Coffee5087,2025-04-23T09:19:22,1
