"I can answer but at some level of generality. Congress appropriates funds to the executive branch for example, The Homeland Security Appropriations Act will give DHS some amount of money each year. Some of those funds are only allowed to be spent on specific things. Most, however, are appropriated with budget authority ie permission from Congress to the Secretary of the Department to ‚Äúallocate‚Äù those funds how the Department sees fit. For example, Coast Guard is in DHS. DHS will allocate some of the overall DHS funds to Coast Guard. Within that allocation the process repeats: some of that allocation will come with specific limits and some will come with delegated authority for the Coast Guard to decide what to spend it on. That ability to use funds at your discretion (but still in a way that furthers your statutory mission) is how the administration is paying for CECOT. That funding part, at least, is not controversial. Congress could, through appropriations, prohibit the administration from spending money on CECOT but that seems unlikely until the midterms.",DimplesWilliams,2025-04-18T06:43:03,23
