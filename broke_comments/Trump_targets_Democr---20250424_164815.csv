"**TL;DR**: Trump targets ActBlue, Democrats' main fundraising platform, with a memo ordering an investigation into unproven claims of illegal foreign donations. ActBlue's CEO calls it an attempt to undermine confidence in democracy. GOP lawmakers amplify allegations, while Democrats prepare for midterms with new funding strategies.",pharrt,2025-04-24T16:50:41,1

"Investigating act blue so they can get a list of who has or is donating to democrats so they know who to jail. Don't forget, trump said he would jail democratic donors.",paxwells97,2025-04-24T17:19:40,1

"You know what I hate?  I hate that the Democrats won't take the step of investigating OBVIOUS Russian links to Trump because they don't want to be seen as partisan, while Trump makes up excuses to 'investigate' Democrats while he's eating hamburders and we all go along with it.",AsamaMaru,2025-04-24T17:41:52,1

"I wouldn’t mind donating directly to AOC, Bernie and other Dems with spine and Good Faith policy.  ActBlue asks for tips and I think they get a bit of what is donated.   So cool, I’d love for 3 whole dollars I give every month to go directly to AOC instead of 2.40 or whatever.",_the_last_druid_13,2025-04-24T17:11:19,1

And anyways, if ActBlue goes down, a direct to politician/cause via website would only make us as a nation more involved. They wanted *somebody to do something*, well if it goes down we will be that much more involved with the somebodies who should be doing the somethings.",_the_last_druid_13,2025-04-24T21:05:44,1
