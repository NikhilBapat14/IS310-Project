"I heard for a long time that food dyes maybe the cause of some child development issues or allergies, but I only know one person who really says they’re allergic to a color dye and she’s the same person who thinks that when mercury gets too far away from earth she’s gonna have a bad month",animalslover4569,2025-04-22T19:52:38,9
how will we know they are gone with no food regulation agency to enforce it?,Free_Dot_3197,2025-04-22T21:17:48,6
I dunno but that sounds “woke” to me. Wadda ya think MAGA?,Dgp68824402,2025-04-22T20:08:40,3
"My favorite part about some of these dyes is not only are they legal in Europe, Australia and Japan but they have higher regulatory limits too.",rkdg840,2025-04-22T20:42:59,3
As someone sensitive to red lake 40 dye this helps but what would really help is for the FDA to continue testing milk.,virus_apparatus,2025-04-22T20:55:06,3

If it wasn’t for the whole “vaccines cause autism” part of RFK I would think he’s a pretty okay head of the FDA,SportsFanBUF,2025-04-22T20:12:49,4
So these dyes are so dangerous and toxic and no one else has ever tried to have them banned?  Why now?,jtsa5,2025-04-22T20:27:49,3
we can pause in the good news moments and take a deep breath.,fxkatt,2025-04-22T20:05:30,2

"My kid got weird stomach aches after eating fruit loops. Before you say it's sugar, it's not. Other cereal is fine. Other sweets are fine. We just avoid the ones with a lot of food dye now.  I'm not a crunchy person. I generally just ask my kids to eat nutritious food before a snack food or treat.",mattgen88,2025-04-22T21:05:30,2

"How is this insane? I agree trump’s administration and especially RFK are crazy, but this decision is actually very important, we have to improve our standards of food, just look at the differences between Europe and the US when it comes to packaged foods.",RhubarbBeginning5638,2025-04-23T01:20:15,2

"It's crazy because it's not based on science. Many of the artificial colorings that RFK Jr.'s fans claim are banned in the U.S. are not actually banned. Additionally, bans in the U.S. are often precautionary and don't usually have much solid evidence (they are typically based on rat models, which are not applicable to humans).",DrakoXMusic1,2025-04-24T00:51:42,1

"You show me one dye and you think it means everything is allowed?  And by the way, even as it's not banned it's still regulated WAY more than USA and you need to have information that it is used in product while in USA you doesn't need even that.",Mastercio,2025-04-24T02:50:22,0
“Way more regulated.” It’s not. It just requires a label. Its use is not restricted or banned.,GimmeDatSideHug,2025-04-24T03:28:59,0
