"Why are Trump supporters ignoring all of the warnings from our country's most senior and respected leaders? They don't seem to take this seriously. In Bob Woodward's new book, General Mark Milley called Trump ""fascist to the core"" and a threat to our country. Are Trump supporters not seeing this stuff, or just ignoring it? Because it seems to me that if Americans could trust anyone, they'd trust Trump's Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.",SpecialK_Anon,2024-10-13T12:22:39,17
"Why have Republicans become so weird and horrible?  Republicans complain about voter fraud and stolen elections but then try to do voter fraud and steal elections. Christians back Trump despite him being a horrible and immoral person. Conservatives back him despite him massively raising the deficit. Military people back him despite him saying soldiers who die are losers. Republicans as a whole seem to have given up on fair elections and democracy despite invading the Middle East 20 years ago to ""spread democracy"".  And that's without mentioning all the alternative facts, denialism, conspiracy theories, lies, misinformation etc that they're constantly putting out and believing. Don't get me started on flat earthers.  Why has half the US gone absolutely bonkers in the last couple of decades? How can they be so willing to throw all their values under the bus?

"I have voted Republican.  I consider myself an independent voter.  To me there is a difference between  MAGA and Republican voters.  I asked a MAGA hat wearing old man if he was ok with 19 to 25 year-olds going through our government and accessing EVERYONES personal data.  How do these boys have ANY experience to look for corruption etc.  All he could respond with is Trump is doing a GREAT JOB.  Called me a ""Democrat""! The Democrats are horrible!  This seems to be a MAGA programed answer and they seem to have no view of their own.  That was not my question.  I did not ask about what Democrats had done.  The question was ""Are you ok with 19 to 25 year-olds going through your personal information?""  Seems when MAGA voters are asked to think all they can do is blame Democrats..  Fact:  Not ONE Democrat was involved in letting 19 to 25 year-olds ransack government organizations.  Fact: It is Trump and Elon and the Republican Congressmen/women who are allowing this to happen.  Truly EVERYONE both MAGA, Republican and Democratic voters should be worried about ANYONE with ZERO experience accessing our personal data.

There are a few who argue against them, but many lies and falsehoods appear to be repeatedly un-challenged.  I understand that debating against a decided Trump voter is very unlikely to cause them to flip. But the discussions are also read by many people and some might be undecided voters. If democrats got volunteers to be active in these forums and answering in a polite manner with facts, pointing out lies, the double standards, the simple and often juvenile trump tactics etc, etc.. could it be useful and have an effect for the democrats? May not flip anybody directly, but could it create some doubt, or cognitive dissonance, and lower enthusiasm perhaps?  After all, the trump supporters seems to be ""trained"" to disregard all negative news as fake news, so arguing directly with a person is perhaps a better way to reach out to them. Or will it just fire up their base and cause even more polarization? And if it is a lost cause, what is a better alternative for the democrats?",stinky-pale-al,2024-10-18T15:17:21,3

"  OK, so as we get into the final stretch of the New York trial, I just want to know-- how likely is a guilty verdict realistically? All this time I've sort of been operating under the assumption that it's the most likely outcome.       But lately I've become more and more concerned that we could be heading towards a mistrial-- the jury might be unable to reach a decision, and the judge could call the case off. This, of course, would benefit Trump greatly, as he could then paint the entire affair as a smear job by the Democratic party.   And I‚Äôve been reading the live updates from reporters and I have to be honest, the way they‚Äôre portraying it has me worried the jury isn‚Äôt going to believe Cohen, who‚Äôs the key witness.

"There are a lot of people who vote Republican simply because they falsely believe Republicans will lower their taxes. Concerning voting for Trump, they ignore several things:    1) unless they are billionaires or corporations, Trump only lowered their taxes temporarily. Taxes for everyone except corporations and billionaires are increasing yearly from 2021 to 2027 per instructions, in the tax bill Trump signed while in office.   2) The Trump tax bill drastically reduced the amount of state tax a middle-class family could write off in their federal tax. Yeah, now he says he wants to roll this back, but it would take an act of Congress and he is just desperately trying to win   3) Tariffs are a sales tax and economics predict Trump's tariffs (which he can do without Congress)  will add on average \~$4000 in costs to the average family    4) Every little gimmick tax write off trump proposes, opens up a major loophole the wealthy can exploit to lower their tax:  no tax on tips, ok now CEOS are paid in tips; no tax on overtime, great you get minimum wage for your first 40 hours, after 40 hours, you go on over time and are paid millions, for everyone else, he wants to get rid of overtime classification.    5) Trump's tax will drastically increased deficit spending. He told us all it would pay for itself and now we can see it clearly didn't    6) All of these things, he would have to get through Congress as would Harris have to get her policies (except tariffs) Though we have seen in practice every time Republicans pass anything, it ultimately just benefits the wealthy   Why do they still claim to vote for lower taxes, when he doesn't care about lowering their taxes?",cdrcdr12,2024-09-24T08:32:14,2

"(I tried to make a thread about this but the mods told me to bring it here)  So I'm just gonna say it: I've been experiencing nearly daily anxiety with this election cycle, with my brain constantly going back to the worst-case-scenario in the event that Trump wins. IE: he will become a dictator. While I understand that this is *unlikely*, the possibility is still nerve wracking.  But I'm more concerned by what he can *realistically* do if elected and how it will impact this country in both the long and short term, particularly with implementing the controversial Project 25. I've heard all the common talking points; ""We survived his first term"" (before he had eight years to build up a following of fanatic loyalists); ""Every candidate says this every election"" (he is the first to deny the results of a fair election and inspire insurrection); ""He's too old/incompetent"" (he can pack the White House with die-hard yes-man who will let him get away with anything).  I want to have faith that local governments -especially since even republican politicians are turning on him- will be able to keep him on a leash, but I just don't know...  What I really want from this thread is a *measured* response from people who know more about the inner workings of our government. I'm tired of endless, apocalyptic doomscrolling and overly fluffy hugboxes. I want to know what I can realistically expect in the event of a Trump victory, and how likely he can carry through/be prevented from carrying through his more outlandish plans (prosecuting political rivals, removing the board of education, censoring the media, mass deportation, stripping LGBT rights, having more power of the DoJ, using the military on protestors/civilians, and so on).

Lately, I've been trying to educate myself more on politics and distance myself from his negativity to form my own opinions. **My question is: are these kinds of predictions about civil war or total societal collapse just overblown fear and anger, or is there something to worry about?**  It feels to me like, no matter who wins an election, most people's daily lives don‚Äôt drastically change‚Äîat least not more than they did during something major like COVID.

Two, many Republicans in Congress voted in favor of the ban and 2026 is a midterm election, not a presidential election.  Three, the Supreme Court unanimously upheld the ban despite the court having a 6-3 conservative majority with Trump, himself, appointing three of the justices during his first term.

"Hi, I have a question that I hope someone can help with. I have no legal training, just an interested layman.  Like many others, I have been following the news about lawsuits against this Trump administration's executive orders, including opinions about whether certain judges do or do not have certain powers.  Along the way, I decided to Google ""federalist papers on judicial power"" - the passage below caught my eye.  So my political question is - Why wasn't a different system of selecting federal judges created if the desire was to maintain federal courts that were ""independent from the control of the elected branches""? Why is it that presidents are the ones who nominate federal judges?  As history has shown, each president nominates as many like-minded judges as they can. To me that seems to undermine the stated goal of an independent judiciary.  I'm not sure how a different system would work, but it seems to me that the existing system just allows the executive branch to effectively control it - or at the very least exert a high degree of influence over judicial review. And - as is happening now with Trump and his allies - a high degree of power over threatening to impeach judges or to defy court orders.  Thanks for any help.  >On the other hand, he \[Alexander Hamilton\] also emphasized the importance of an independent judiciary and the power of judicial review. ¬†With judicial independence, the Constitution put barriers in place‚Äîlike life tenure and salary protections‚Äîto ensure that the federal courts were independent from the control of the elected branches. ¬†And with judicial review, federal judges had the power to review the constitutionality of the laws and actions of the government‚Äîensuring that they met the requirements of the new Constitution.

How do you reconcile your macro political beliefs with the effects on a micro level you might disagree with?  Perhaps this is a failing on my behalf or a lack of conviction in my values but there are many things I believe at a Macro level that directly contradict with my own personal views at a more localised level.   For example in the UK there‚Äôs a big shift in wanting to reduce immigration. I actually agree with this when looking at the bigger picture but there have been a few cases where I‚Äôve seen how this has or could be implemented that I disagree with. For example I have a lot of foreign friends. Some of the bigger picture things I tend to support may have unintended consequences towards some of these friends or their families. Such as family members being deported. The sort of thing where the immediate response would be ‚Äúoh when I said immigrants I didn‚Äôt mean these guys‚Äù. Or the idea I support helping asylum seekers but you get the case here or there and you‚Äôd potentially feel ‚Äúyeah I‚Äôm down with reducing  the number of asylum seekers but not those guys‚Äù.   Maybe climate change where I‚Äôm all in favour of carbon taxes or similar rules but then I see individual issues raised with how some people end up struggling because these things have affected them on a personal basis.      Is it a lack of commitment to my values? Perhaps my values haven‚Äôt been thought out well enough to cover all eventualities? Maybe it‚Äôs a failing on my behalf where I feel nuance in political discourse is dead and you‚Äôre either fore or against with no room for grey areas? I dunno. All I do know is that there‚Äôs a tendency to think about everything in absolute means and unfortunately I feel in practice we forget there are real life human life‚Äôs at risk and everything is based on the abstract and we forget about our own local communities.   It feels like cognitive dissonence creeps in a lot of the time and perhaps a paradox forms where I end up with two directly opposed views    I‚Äôve started telling myself that everything should be looked at both in the macro AND the micro level and try and make things work across both but sometimes these things just don‚Äôt line up. Where my ideas for the bigger picture directly contradict how I‚Äôd want to see things at a micro level. Maybe I‚Äôm too empathetic and this is ruling my heads.

"Can you explain to a non US citizen why voter ID laws are bad? Can you explain to a non US citizen why voter ID laws are bad?   Hello, European here. I've seen a lot of negative press regarding voter ID laws (even before Trump's recent executive order), but don't quite understand why it is such a divisive issue. In most European countries this is non problematic. Almost everyone has a form of ID, it is mandated by law to have with yourself at all times, and no one really questions identifying themselves before casting their vote. I understand that this does not prevent all forms of voter fraud or other kinds of political manipulation, but I'm still genuinely confused.

I had to self deport to Colombia, where I now live in Medellin.  Now, my question is pretty straight forward, Why doesnt Trump simply open up a few of the immigration facilities he helped clear, assign 50 INS judges to all these Asylum, Deportation cases to zip  and filter through. Didnt Elon Musk save the govenment Trillons, how could this project truly hurt. BENEFITS: It would provide employment in the areas of the facilities', it would allow people to have a fair chance to stay here if warranted by allowing the judge to review everything on a case by case basis. It would also quiet the left because he is at least giving people like me, a fair chance to stay in the only country most of them know and love.

"What should go on a Trump dystopian bingo card? I'm looking for the most extreme things people are predicting about his presidency.  Here's a few I've got:  25% blanket tariffs on a major trading partner (Canada, Mexico, China, etc). Doesn't count narrow, industry-specific tariffs. Must last more than 6 months (to exclude tariffs just used for negotiating purposes).  Inflation goes above 4.94% (average during Biden administration) for 1 year.  Inflation goes above 8.55% for 6 months. That's the highest 6-month average under Biden.  Repeal of birthright citizenship makes it to a floor vote with at least half the Republicans in the chamber voting in favor.  Mass deportations of non-criminal illegal immigrants. Not counting one-time border crossing as the underlying crime, and not counting apprehensions at the border. Setting the benchmark at 2 million (Obama's number).  2026 midterm elections cancelled or rigged. In this case ""rigging"" doesn't mean gerrymandering or reducing early voting, etc. Rigging is outright fraud in the vote, such as large numbers of fake ballots or altering the vote tallies.  2028 election cancelled or rigged.  Trump officially files for 3rd presidential run.  Nationwide abortion ban makes it to floor vote with at least half the Republicans voting in favor. Ban needs to be 12 weeks or earlier.  Worst January 6th rioters pardoned. This is looking at those convicted of violent crimes against police or the few seditious conspiracy charges.  Department of Education shut down in such a way where states receive half or less of their current government subsidies.  Member of Congress gets federal indictment over impeachment vote against Trump.  Any traditional vaccine gets banned. This would include things like polio or MMR, but not the recent Covid vaccines (since we've already had the pause/recall on J&J vaccine).  Federal government bans fluoride in water.  US military (not National Guard) used for domestic law enforcement.  US cuts off lethal military aid to Ukraine without a Ukrainian-backed peace deal. Needs to be more than a delay in aid or threat to cut off aid.  National ban on porn for adults. Has to be actual ban, not age verification.

"Can a Woman be the President of the USA in the near future?   Hi all,  I am a history and politics student in the UK. History is my poison of choice, being best versed in the American civil war, and its antebellum period, whilst studying politics is more of an interest and a hobby. I especially enjoy reading about American politics for a multitude of reasons, one such reason being the complexity of it.  I remember reading something after the election last year and it got me thinking, and after talking about it with people not particularly knowledgeable about American politics, I thought I would make this post to get everyones thoughts.  The two women that have run for President have both lost, however both did not have smooth campaigns. Kamala did not enjoy a full campaign run, and Hilary has A LOT of baggage, even without issues that happened with Bernie that split some Democrats away from her. There are logical reasons why they did not win, however how much of a factor was their gender in the outcome of the vote?   Is this an issue about the women that have run for President, or women running for President? If Michelle Obama or Nikki Haley, for example, were to run for President in the next election against a man, would their gender impact their prospects of becoming President? Ultimately, can a woman become President in the next 20 years? Why, or why not?  It is a multilayered question, and I urge you to try to remove political bias when you think about this question, however this is obviously difficult to do.

"Posted this but awaiting mod approval. I'm impatient so here we are.  With Harris the presumptive nominee, we now look towards her choice of VP. The position of VP is typically used to fill some sort of role that is not always fulfilled by the POTUS nominee. Across many other subreddits, podcasts, and other news sources it seems like Mark Kelly is one of the top contenders for this position. His main benefits are:  * From a swing state (AZ) * Veteran * ""Hero"" status because of astronaut and married to Gabby Giffords, a shooting survivor * Covers bases in terms of demographics (more moderate, white, straight, male)  It's important to also be aware that if Mark Kelly is chosen, there would be a special election in 2026 that could potentially lose Dems a Senate seat (but at this point this feels like a non-factor considering its all-hands-on-deck needed to win the presidency).  However, another name is also being thrown around, **Josh Shapiro.** I have seen little support for him specifically on Reddit and I am baffled as to why. Pennsylvania is a *must-win* for the Dems, because if they lose it, they will require the rest of the swingiest of swing states (MI, WI, NV, AZ) in addition to at least one more of the ""leans red"" swing states (OH, NC, GA), at least according to 270towin.  So, due to this, with Shapiro's popularity in PA and the necessity of the state going blue, he seems like the most straightforward and logical pick, despite his weaknesses of his Jewish heritage (frustrates me that this has to be stated) and his relative inexperience in politics compared to other candidates.

"Hey, I have a question about local politics that redditors might be able to help me with.  My district, MN-38a, has a state representative retiring this year and two candidates are running in the Democratic primary.  (The Democrat will almost certainly win the general ballot in November.)  Neither of the primary candidates have the Democratic party support; the state party is letting the two candidates battle it out for themselves.  Wynfred Russell is a refugee from Liberia.  He is a founder of a non-profit, served on my city council and had a failed bid at mayor.  His priorities (that I can find) are mental health resources and increasing police funding.  Huldah Hiltsley is an immigrant from Kenya.  She is a data security manager and founder of a non-profit, and had a failed run at Senator.  I can't find any specific policies in which she differs from her opponent.  (Both have boilerplate policies about reducing violence and increasing healthcare and education and business so on.)  This is a fascinating campaign to me, not the least because it's in my district.  I did not know before this that my city is only 38% white -- a minority-majority district -- so first-generation immigrants from Africa definitely are better representatives than someone who looks like me.  But I can't decide between the two of these candidates.  Russell looks like he has slightly more experience (and it should be noted that he personally came to my door to shake my hand).

"I'd like to know something: Is there a site where I can see & track statistics on how often a US law is challenged as unconstitutional, and how often they're declared unconstitutional, and to sort those statistics by constitutional right asserted?   For example, in regards to the First Amendment, I understand that laws which restrict people's freedom of religion tend to be upheld as constitutional in the majority of cases, but only barely a majority. On the other hand, whenever a law is challenged under the free speech right, it tends to be struck down as unconstitutional over 90% of the time.  I can't remember the source where I originally read that. But I'd really like to know if there's a site that keeps track of cases where laws & ordinances are challenged as being unconstitutional, sort them based on what constitutional right they're allegedly infringing, and track stats accordingly. For example, the above paragraph discusses First Amendment rights, but what about the Second Amendment? How often are laws which allegedly tread upon the right to bear arms struck down as unconstitutional?  I'd prefer a site that sticks only to cast-iron objective facts. Those facts can then be used by us to form our opinions on constitutional matters such as gun control rights, but we need the cast-iron objective facts with no spin in order to do that.",acerthorn3,2024-10-03T20:42:15,1

"This is just something that bothers me around the   current state of the US election because  as you all know people feared ¬†the rematch of the 2020 election that Trump will make a comeback to the election to regain his presidency because of his ego (that he got from his controversial lawyer Roy Cohn) and Biden was the current president but its his age problem and their fears are correct , Trump has become the republican nominee and Biden has displayed his age during his disastrous debate with Trump and because of that, the democratic party who feared that Trump will win ¬†and Biden will lose despite his age and controversy will have to urge Biden to end his campaign and let Vice president Kamala ¬†Harris take his place instead and it did.  So instead of the repeat of the 2020 election which many American don‚Äôt want, ¬†its Kamala vs Trump (who is now considered the old candidate like Biden),¬† and this time Kamla is the popular candidate and less controversial than Trump that she will likely become the first  female president of the United States of America something Hilary Clinton tried.     However as shown in the current state of the US election, Trump has proved more popular than ever despite his controversies and still have supporters while Kamala despite being popular is struggling in the polls of some of the states , there are some undecided voters, and the poll proved that both candidates are neck and neck, ¬†not to mention some people think that Hurricane Milton in Florida proves to be the October surprise (it happened with a previous hurricane called ¬†Sandy during the 2012 election)  Most Americans don‚Äôt want another Trump presidency and it feels like 2016 election all over again with trump making a dark horse victory against Hilary Clinton when people think the polls indicate that Hilary will win but it didn‚Äôt ¬†, I mean many people think BJP will lose the Haryana election and Congress will win ¬†because of the polls but the results prove wrong , it‚Äôs like history would repeat itself with Kamala winning the popular vote but not the electorate vote as Trumps luck will once again help him regain his presidency by winning the Electorate vote ¬†even though most people did not believe the polls.  ¬†  So, I need to ask you around  the current state of the US election, 2024 do you think  ¬†either trump or Kamala ¬†will win the presidency?",trover2345325,2024-10-11T01:51:55,1

"The political convention is that parties lose seats when they have the presidency because voters blame the person at the top, and their party by extension, for any economic trouble/scandal/power overreach.  Opposition parties gain seats because they can sit back, stir the pot and blame everything on the president.  We see how brutal midterms can be for the party in power; it's all but given that they will lose the house. The 'six year itch' phenomenon also adds to the idea that voters will inevitably punish the party in power simply because they are in charge.  So is there a long term political strategy to keep losing the presidency and to instead build your power in the senate and the house so that once you do have the presidency, you have enough seats to override the senate filibuster and pass significant legislation within the 2 years you'll have your majority?  It sounds pretty crazy and risky to intentionally neglect winning the presidency but how else can a party actually deliver the promises they give voters without having the seats needed in Congress?

Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic who spreads medical disinformation and conspiracy theories, to head the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) alarmed public health experts who say that Kennedy‚Äôs potential confirmation could have dire consequences for the state of health and science in America. >  > ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt think of a darker day for public health and science itself than the election of Donald Trump and the nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of health,‚Äù says Lawrence Gostin, director of Georgetown University‚Äôs O‚ÄôNeill Institute for National and Global Health Law.  >  > ‚ÄúTo say that RFK Jr. is unqualified is a considerable understatement,‚Äù he continues. ‚ÄúThe minimum qualification for being the head of the Department of Health and Human Services is fidelity to science and scientific evidence, and he spent his entire career fomenting distrust in public health and undermining science at every step of the way.‚Äù >  > If confirmed by the Senate, Kennedy would have sway over health agencies like the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that fall under the purview of HHS. Kennedy, who endorsed Trump in the 2024 election after ending his own longshot presidential campaign as an independent, has promoted a plan to ‚ÄúMake America Healthy Again,‚Äù which includes goals like reversing ‚Äúan epidemic of chronic disease,‚Äù banning certain food additives and chemicals, and cleaning up ‚Äútoxic chemicals from our air, water, and soil.‚Äù >  > But Kennedy, 70, has faced blowback for spreading medical disinformation. He has falsely claimed that vaccines cause autism, which has been debunked by years of scientific research proving vaccines are safe and effective. He‚Äôs claimed that adding fluoride to the water supply‚Äîa safe and long-standing practice that protects oral health‚Äîis linked to IQ loss, bone cancer, and more, and has said he would stop the practice. **He‚Äôs accused the FDA of ‚Äúaggressive suppression‚Äù of raw milk; the FDA doesn‚Äôt order people not to drink raw milk, but cautions that raw milk can contain dangerous bacteria, including E. coli and listeria, which can lead to illnesses and even death (health authorities have also been advising the public to avoid drinking raw milk during the bird flu outbreak, since the virus can survive in it).** >  > Since the election, Kennedy has said that he and the Trump Administration wouldn‚Äôt take vaccines off the market, but public health experts are concerned that he would appoint officials in the FDA or CDC who share his debunked anti-vaccine views and could try to slow, restrict, or revoke vaccine approvals. Gostin says there are ‚Äúguardrails‚Äù in place that would prevent Kennedy from passing extreme policies‚Äîfor instance, the head of HHS wouldn‚Äôt have the power to ban vaccinations or vaccination mandates, since those public health powers are left up to state or local officials. If the FDA tried to withdraw approval of a vaccine without scientific justification, Gostin says he expects that that argument wouldn‚Äôt hold up in court. >  > Even so, Gostin says he believes Kennedy ‚Äúcould do enormous damage‚Äù when it comes to vaccine policy in the U.S. He worries that HHS could ‚Äúcherry pick‚Äù data that casts doubt on the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, which could influence state and local officials and sow public distrust. Agencies like the FDA and CDC ‚Äúset the scientific gold standard for public health recommendations,"" and if they release false or misleading information, Gostin worries ‚Äúit will poison the well of public opinion and nobody will know who to trust.‚Äù And that could lead to fewer people getting vaccinated and ‚Äúan explosion‚Äù of vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles, mumps, and rubella, Gostin says. >  > ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have somebody who‚Äôs a vaccine denier and science skeptic as head of the nation‚Äôs most venerable scientific agencies,‚Äù Gostin says. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs shown that, on a huge range of public health issues, he takes the position outside the scientific mainstream, that he peddles mis- and disinformation, and that he‚Äôs not to be trusted with the health and safety of Americans.‚Äù >  > Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children‚Äôs Hospital of Philadelphia who has served on CDC and FDA vaccine advisory committees, says he was ‚Äúsickened‚Äù by the news of Kennedy being nominated for the position. He compares Kennedy being considered for the role to ‚Äúhaving somebody who doesn‚Äôt believe in gravity being the head of NASA.‚Äù He criticizes Kennedy for previously indicating that he would deprioritize infectious diseases as a research focus at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). >  > **‚ÄúWe are experiencing an H5N1 [bird flu] outbreak right now, and so if we remove infectious disease funding‚Äîthen what?

But Offit says the nomination alone is a concerning representation of a lack of trust in science. Experts worry that Kennedy could continue to spread medical misinformation as the head of HHS‚Äîand that many people will believe it. >  > ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a good chance that falsehoods and rumors will be broadcast from the most powerful office in the nation, and I think this will drive confusion, anxiety, and questions that are going to have a direct negative impact on Americans who genuinely have good questions and are interested in making evidence-based health decisions,‚Äù Jetelina says. ‚ÄúMy biggest concern is the disinformation that will be amplified‚Äîthat is no longer on the fringes, but it will become mainstream.‚Äù >  > While many public health experts fear Kennedy‚Äôs stances on vaccines and infectious diseases, some are more optimistic about his positions on food and nutrition.

"What is my political affiliation?  For quite some time I have described myself as a Libertarian at the federal level. This being the true definition of libertarian ‚Äî the federal government should protect constitutional rights, military directives, necessary regulations that should apply across state lines(FDA, USDA, EPA, and a few others, albeit with their powers limited). However, where this diverges, is I believe everything else, such as extrinsic rights not explicitly given in the constitution should be at the state level.  The idea behind this is that states are large enough to have the necessary funds and abilities to run an effective government (compared to a small town of ~100 people), while still being small enough to understand the individuals who live there and the problems they face on a day to day.    What kind of political ideology even is this? The only thing I can find that comes close to it is pre-civil war era politics.   Other political ideologies of mine: 1. Decreased to potentially no federal tax ‚Äî all federal funds should be funneled through state taxes up the chain. 2. States operating their own military and training during peaceful periods (exception being military research, development, and high ranking generals and admin during war times). 3.

"Why is the Gaza discussion so onesided?   So first of all I want to start this question by saying that I am not really that deeply informed in the history of the Israel Gaza conflict. But here is what I am seeing in the masses of the public and I hope someone can clear this up for me.  The news for me first arose when Gaza invaded a festival taking about approximately 800 civilians as hostages. I know the history goes way way beyond that but since that‚Äôs the aspect that I don‚Äôt understand, I‚Äôm gonna start there. As expected Israel started counter attacks to free the hostages. I know the attacks go way beyond just freeing the civilians and is by all means above any measures that can be justified to free civilians. But although these attacks are harsh and way beyond good morals. I see basically everyone completely siding with Gaza.  Now, as I see it, neither side is innocent here, Israel‚Äôs attacks are brutal and are impacting the civilians of Gaza way too heavily. But the initial attack against the civilians of Israel is an inhuman act as well. I don‚Äôt know how people can deem Gaza/Hamas innocent and side completely with either side of the story? Both are wrong and I feel like people siding with Gaza are completely disregarding the 800 civilian hostages and no historic events can justify the attacks on innocent people on either side.  Sorry for the bad grammar. English is not my native language. Thank you all for your answers in advance.

"Why did David Lebryk resign as chief ""banker"" at US Treasury?  Did Musk threaten his family???  Musk and his henchpersons are now in control of SS, Medicare payments, grants, making false claims, and all taxpayer info.  Does anyone know if marches are being organized for Feb 5?  from Heather Cox Richardson:  ""But then, yesterday, Elon Musk forced the resignation of David A. Lebryk, the highest-ranking career official at the Treasury Department. Lebryk had been at Treasury since 1989 and had risen to become the person in charge of the U.S. government payment system that disburses about $6 trillion a year through Social Security benefits, Medicare, Medicaid, contracts, grants, salaries for federal government workers, tax refunds, and so on, essentially managing the nation‚Äôs checkbook.  According to Jeff Stein, Isaac Arnsdorf, and Jacqueline Alemany of the¬†*Washington Post*, Musk‚Äôs team wanted access to the payment system. Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) demanded answers from Trump‚Äôs new Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, warning that ‚Äúthese payment systems simply cannot fail, and any politically-motivated meddling in them risks severe damage to our country and the economy. I am deeply concerned that following the federal grant and loan freeze earlier this week, these officials associated with Musk may have intended to access these payment systems to illegally withhold payments to any number of programs. I can think of no good reason why political operators who have demonstrated a blatant disregard for the law would need access to these sensitive, mission-critical systems.‚Äù  Now, though, with Musk‚Äôs people at the computers that control the nation‚Äôs payment system, they can simply stop whatever payments they want to.  Wyden continued by reminding Bessent that the press has reported that Musk has previously been ‚Äúdenied a high-level clearance to access the government‚Äôs most sensitive secrets. I am concerned that Musk‚Äôs enormous business operation in China‚Äîa country whose intelligence agencies have stolen vast amounts of sensitive data about Americans, including U.S. government employee data by hacking U.S. government systems‚Äîendangers U.S. cybersecurity and creates conflicts of interest that make his access to these systems a national security risk.‚Äù  This afternoon, Wyden posted that he has been told that Bessent has given the Department of Government Efficiency full access to the system. ‚ÄúSocial Security and Medicare benefits, grants, payments to government contractors, including those that compete directly with Musk's own companies. All of it.‚Äù  Josh Marshall of¬†*Talking Points Memo*¬†posted: ‚ÄúThis is more or less like taking the gold from Fort Knox and putting it in Elons basement.

"How in the world did the Democrats not prepare a two term candidate the minute Trump won the 2016 election?   I'm very puzzled at the way the Democrats handled Trumps win in 2016.    I am actually a libertarian so I vote either way, so this is not about partisan thinking.   But it seems like they basically self-sabotaged their party.  This actually makes me think there's some sort of ""behind the scenes"" group that's basically just propping up Biden as a figurehead.     How in the world didn't they think of the upcoming election when they ran  Biden and Harris.  IMO Harris is utterly useless and Biden was already way too old to be running even in 2020.  So why did they use Harris as the VP?  They basically  screwed us all in this upcoming election.    Biden is so close to being incapacitated that it's glaringly obvious that voting for Biden is essentially voting for Harris as president.  (Something Trump's team has jumped on in their ads.)  It's similar in my opinion to how McCain lost the election because he ran with Sarah Palin when he had gone through some major health issues in addition to being older.   Why would you pick an inexperienced dingbat as a running mate when you know there's the potential for them to be pushed into the position of President.  I just don't understand how we are down to these two options.    The only way I can see out of it,   would be if Trump picked a really strong VP candidate and wins the election.   And then something ""happened to him"" that then pushed the VP into the position of Presidency.  It's the only possible way to get out of this hot mess and at least attempt to get our country back on track.

(B) If your proposed rule doesn't meet (1) and (2), you can feel free to amend it and try again.  *For those unfamiliar with the terms, ""electioneering"" refers to ads that specifically mention candidates, elections, say ""vote"", etc. [Here's a fun West Wing clip.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb2yDLr5U3c) ""Issue ads"" talk about issues without direct reference to a candidate or voting.

It's one thing that even though Trump incited an insurrection, his chances of being re-elected as president in Nov. are looking good right now, but what makes this situation so much worse in my opinion, is that a major reason his chances are looking good is because the Supreme Court, the highest court in our land, decided to help Trump evade accountability for what he did on 1/6.

"Why didn't food prices spike from the removal of illegal immigrants under Clinton, W. Bush, or Obama?  For reference, Clinton deported about 1.2 million, W. Bush deported 1.2 million, and Obama deported 2 million.

I don't recall a massive increase in food prices during those years or there being much rhetoric about it.  And a tangential observation: It seems that the parties have flipped when it comes to wage increases increasing the cost of goods. The right is largely unconcerned about what will happen to prices if companies have to replace low-paid illegal immigrant labor with higher paid legal labor and the left is raising a stink about it. But if we're talking about companies having to pay higher wages due to an increase in the minimum wage, the right will talk about $30 Big Macs and the left will respond that other countries with higher wages don't actually have those higher prices.",bl1y,2024-12-16T18:23:10,-1

"I had a topic I would like to discuss but I'm unsure if it fits the sub-reddit. You let me know-  I'm wondering if people would be interested in discussing how 'white is not a race.', in the same way 'people of color' is not a race. As they're only umbrella terms meant to describe a persons appearance- not their culture, history or traditions.  Like people of color- white people are also a diverse group with many different races included- the Irish, Scottish, Italian, Scandinavian, the list goes on. With huge differences in culture and historical events related to their lineage.  But this misunderstanding that white people are a race leads to many inconsistencies and inaccuracies. People often falsely assume that two white people share a culture that values things like imperialism but it's a mixed bag of oppressor and oppressed and always has been for as long as humans have lived. It causes a type of racism and judgement towards white people that is undeserved.  For example, some people will say 'Jewish people are not white', but many are. Such as Jon Stewart of Kamala Harris's husband. They are Jewish, but also white. Since if you get robbed by one of these men you would describe them to police as so. Even if they were wearing a yamaka, you would tell them ""I was robbed by a white man wearing a yamaka."".  Does that make sense? I know it's a bit of an oddball perspective but I think it's an inherently political discussion but you let me know if it belongs in the sub. Perhaps it does but is too inflammatory to be worth discussing. But I'm not saying or insinuating anything negative about anyone, only that the term 'white people' is the same as 'people of color' as it does not denote a particular history, culture or lineage and set of traditions.

Can someone offer some reassurance about this?",aaronarium,2024-07-29T18:33:58,0

"How do you project the world order changes in the next 10-20 years?  The way I see it, the global political regime is adrift towards more and more conflict, more and more separation and isolation  European countries have been divided due to trade agreements and coalitions that slowly benefitted certain countries (e.g. Germany) over others (e.g. Greece), and EU largely lost its appeal  Ukraine wants to become part of this divided Europe but Russian doesn't want to lose its grip on it, and to counter it, Ukraine has now invaded Russia, questioning the power of Putin's regime  Israel is comitting a genocide in Gaza and has a desire to drag the US into a larger war with Iran, which recently elected a more liberal and hopeful leader  In the US, a convicted criminal wannabe dictator is in a close race with a democrat who's been energizing the country's political sphere. A potential dictator could usurp the chaos of this global political regime and move it much faster towards disastrous destruction, while the other party doesn't appear to express a strong will in fixing this broken world order  So I project that in the near future, the world will continue meekly moving towards more conflict and destabilization. A few things can shift the situation within the next 20 years, (1) malicious: a US leader (intentionally or unintentionally) propells the world to a world war, (2) reactive: natural and intentional disasters will boil over, and after paying a heavy cost, political leadership will be forced to evolve past personal ambitions and come up with (more) solid plans for the world order, (3) proactive: seeing as the world is moving towards the oblivion, the US will decide to exert its power to force resolutions to the conflicts, (4) miraculous: probably something along the lines of moral and spiritual evolution that spills over into political sphere through activism  What do you think about all of this?",Best-Idiot,2024-08-20T07:56:33,0

Can Trafalgar be taken seriously? They were almost spot on in the Rust Belt in 2020  After examining 2020 polls I noticed that Trafalgar out of all pollsters was the most accurate by quite a wide margin. I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôre hyper partisan or have odd polling methods but with their unique success in recent elections should they be taken more seriously? I‚Äôve seen a lot of hate and controversy surrounding them. So will they continue their intriguing streak or be outed as a fraud? The reason I bring this up is because presidential polls with Trump on the ballot always seem to be off and Trafalgar despite being super far off in literally every other race (2022 midterms comes to mind) they somehow consistently predict Trump era Presidential races fairly accurately.

"How do I choose between Harris or third party?  Hey everyone, I‚Äôm feeling really conflicted this election cycle and could use some outside perspective. Generally, I side with the Democratic platform, but I‚Äôm also frustrated with the DNC's strong preference for establishment candidates, which I feel hinders meaningful innovation. Right now, my options are voting for Harris, going third party, or leaving the presidential spot blank.  Here‚Äôs my thinking:  If Harris wins, it‚Äôs likely that we won‚Äôt have a Democratic primary until 2032, and by then, I worry the DNC will continue to promote only establishment candidates, pushing out fresh voices. But if we get a competitive 2028 primary, I think there‚Äôs potential to see a larger, more diverse field, with newer ideas getting attention. For me, non-establishment candidates like Andrew Yang in 2020 helped show the value of primaries for exploring and mainstreaming innovative policies like Universal Basic Income (UBI) and ranked-choice voting. The awareness and support for UBI, for example, rose significantly, and I see that as invaluable (Yang claims approval for UBI was at 25% before his run, and 66% after - though I can't validate this and don't know if this is just for dems or what). So, having a vibrant primary, in my view, is one of the best ways to keep our democracy healthy.  With a Harris win, I fear the DNC may feel validated in its current strategy, and we might not get the innovation our democracy needs. And while I can‚Äôt support Trump, I also think his presidency would shake things up enough to foster real dissatisfaction with the two-party system, which might just open up space for a third party to gain traction.  I‚Äôm not sure yet if a third-party vote is the way to go‚Äîwhether it makes a statement strong enough to call for change. But I don‚Äôt want to feel like I‚Äôm validating the current DNC approach by voting for Harris. Does anyone else feel this tension?

"**Will Trump succeed in convincing SCOTUS to accept the Unitary Executive Theory?**  The Unitary Executive Theory suggests that the President has absolute power to dismiss any Executive branch civil servant under the Constitution's Vesting Clause, and that any laws passed by Congress restricting that are unconstitutional.  This would seem to overturn very distant precedent, all the way to the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883. Those supporting this claim that the Civil Service is part of the ""deep state"" which resists Trump's policies. Those opposing it state that it would jeopardize our apolitical civil service and possibly return to a ""Spoils System"", with offices given as rewards or for perceived loyalty, rather than merit or seniority. A major concern to opponents is that, Presidential agenda aside, a weakened Civil Service will not be able to efficiently manage a government as large and diverse as the modern United States Federal Government, an issue which didn't exist at the time when the Vesting Clause was drafted, when America was a largely agrarian country with a very limited central government and almost all power (outside the military) belonging to the states.  Trump's firing of the Inspector-Generals as one of his first acts seems like a shot across the bow. Trump might intend for them to appeal, for the appeal to reach SCOTUS, and for SCOTUS to hold that the President is not bound by the Pendleton Act or other acts, which would allow Trump to carry out his ""drain the swamp"" purge of Federal workers at possibly a much larger scale than otherwise. At worst, if SCOTUS states that no Federal law can limit a President's Constitutional power, that means Trump might not have to abide by even unrelated laws in his hiring and firing, such as discrimination which runs afoul of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

The move could also be interpreted as a response to the volatility of the current Donald Trump administration, which is threatening tariffs on many nations, although the U.S. President‚Äôs approach towards China has not yet been made clear. >  > China started to restrict the distribution of Korean music, movies, dramas, games and all other forms of pop culture in 2016 in retaliation to South Korea‚Äôs deployment of U.S. THAAD missile defense systems. Although Beijing has never officially acknowledged the ban, very few Korean movies or dramas have been released in Chinese cinemas or on streaming platforms and K-pop artists have not been allowed to perform in the country. >  > According to the Korea Economic Daily (KED), a senior official handling China‚Äôs preparations for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, set to take place in China in 2026, said the Chinese government sees the need to strengthen cooperation with Korea: >  > ‚ÄúStarting next month, we will send a private-level cultural delegation to South Korea as the first step toward expanding cultural exchanges, aiming to fully resume cultural cooperation as early as May,‚Äù the official told KED. >  > It may also signal China‚Äôs need to shore up its box office market.

"My question for today is regarding Trump's immunity arguments from Thursday.  I'm sure as a lot of you know, prior to the arguments, I was worried that the three liberal justices were even in favor of taking up the case and sitting on it for seven weeks.  However, after hearing the arguments, it seems pretty evidential that Justice Jackson, at least, very, very likely opposed taking up the immunity claim and most definitely opposed holding off on hearing it until late April.  I mean, her agreeing to hear the case, and especially her agreeing to hold off on it for seven weeks is, in my opinion, totally dissonant to the things she said and the way she presented herself during the arguments.  Would you agree with me there?  PS- Unfortunately, I'm still unsure where Justices Sotomayor and Kagan stood on hearing the case and delaying it for a couple months, but given what went down at the oral arguments, I have a feeling that the opinion might give clues on where they stood.",jonasnew,2024-04-27T07:47:50,-1

For those of you who are supporting Kamala, yet believe it will be Kamala/DNC's fault if Trump wins, how is it that you all are turning a blind eye to the fact that polls from late 2023 and early 2024 showed even Biden ahead of Trump when people were asked who they'd vote for if Trump was convicted on the J6 charges? I mean, if Biden was ahead of Trump in the instance where the latter is convicted on J6, it's clear that in that scenario, Kamala would win in a landslide even picking up states like Florida and Texas in addition to sweeping all of the swing states. However, SCOTUS is the reason to why Trump ended up escaping accountability prior to the election which is why I say that it will be their fault if Trump wins, and I just can't understand how even Kamala voters are turning a blind eye to how early polls have proven that Trump would have zero chance if he was held accountable for what he did on J6.",jonasnew,2024-10-07T06:07:59,-1

I have my own rough draft I'll share below for my thoughts on reforming social security for potential longevity and partial use of the trickle down effect and that companys best interest is the share holders.   Title: Social Security Tax Reform Act  Preamble: Whereas, Social Security benefits are a vital source of income for many retirees, and taxing these benefits imposes undue financial strain on recipients who have already contributed to the system through their working years; and Whereas, reforms to the Social Security tax system are necessary to ensure long-term sustainability and growth for future beneficiaries;  Section 1: Purpose Clause  The purpose of this Act is to amend existing tax laws under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) of the United States to eliminate the taxation of Social Security benefits for recipients and establish a sustainable investment strategy for Social Security funds.  Section 2: Definitions  (a) Social Security Benefits: Payments made to eligible individuals under Title II of the Social Security Act. (b) SP 500: The Standard & Poor's 500 Index, a stock market index tracking the performance of 500 large companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges. (c) US Treasury Bonds: Government debt securities issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury.  Section 3: Proposed Changes  (a) Elimination of Taxes on Social Security Benefits: (1) Amend the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) ¬ß86 to exempt Social Security benefits from gross income for federal tax purposes. (2) State and local governments are encouraged to adopt similar exemptions for state tax purposes. (b) Modification of Social Security Tax System: (1) The federal government shall establish a Social Security investment brokerage through a partnership between the U.S. Treasury, the IRS, SECA (Self-Employment Contributions Act), and FICA (Federal Insurance Contributions Act). (2) Social Security taxes collected under FICA and SECA shall be invested into the SP 500 for growth. These investments will be exempt from taxation under IRC ¬ß501(c). (3) Ten years prior to eligibility for Social Security benefits, the funds shall be transitioned from the SP 500 into U.S. Treasury bonds to reduce risk and provide stable returns.  Section 4: Amendments to Existing Laws  (a) The Internal Revenue Code ¬ß86 shall be amended to include a new subsection stating: ""Social Security benefits received under Title II of the Social Security Act shall be excluded from gross income for all federal tax purposes."" (b) The Social Security Act shall be amended to incorporate provisions authorizing the investment strategy outlined in this Act.  Section 5: Enforcement Provisions  (a) The U.S. Treasury, in coordination with the IRS, SECA, and FICA, shall oversee the establishment and operation of the Social Security investment brokerage. (b) Annual performance reports shall be submitted to Congress to ensure transparency and accountability.  Section 6: Funding Mechanisms  This Act requires no additional funding, as Social Security investment operations shall be supported through existing Social Security tax revenues.",Working_Key819,2025-01-11T00:40:08,-1

"Why does no one talk about Huey Long and his 1935 filibuster, which lasted 15 hours and 30 minutes?  He is one of the most fascinating yet forgotten political figures of all time, in my opinion. A Southern firebrand with incredible rhetorical skill, Long knew the Bible not just as a prop but as a genuine moral guide. Many of his ideas were later adopted into the New Deal, and from what I understand, they played a major role in getting us through the Great Depression. Reading his speeches was the first time it truly clicked for me‚Äîthis is what we need, or at least something like it. He‚Äôs the best-case scenario of a populist leader: a fighter for the people, but with the wit and intellect to outmaneuver the powerful.  What made Long so effective wasn‚Äôt just his style, but his authenticity and true intelligence. His skill came from deep conviction, not from rehearsed soundbites or empty slogans. He fought tooth and nail for what he believed in, and he did it with a mix of strategy, humor, and raw political talent that feels almost unheard of today.  Huey Long wasn‚Äôt just a politician‚Äîhe was a force. He fought relentlessly for what America needed to survive and, hopefully, to thrive.

"Real question, maybe this gets removed because 'speculative', but here it goes: I watched some footage from an on-air, appearance (as a guest, not an interview, basically), as well as the Anderson Cooper interview and home visit, with E. Jean Carol. This was the first ever exposure I had to seeing this person 'live' - as in, animated / in a video recording, etc...  I knew who she was. Maybe had seen a picture, possibly, but really, this was my first exposure to the person.  My impression of the situation, my interpretation of all the events pertaining to E. Jean Carol, more or less instantaneously became something like ""This is a person who is not able. This person is simple, child-like in ways, and it appears that she is being used as a tool by... people in the media, and / or people she knows who are connected to courts or politics or something... but I can't shake the feeling that she's essentially a disabled person"". Did anyone else get this feeling? Or is someone a professional in this sense: working with adults with special needs or who works in social services or something, who can maybe explain the likelihood of this being or not being the case? The Anderson Cooper thing, I felt, made her look a bit eccentric, or, quirky-crazy, etc...really, neither here nor there on that one.  But in that other clip (sorry, I don't know who the news anchor, or show host was that she was talking with), where's starts talking about what she plans to do with the money, and she's kind of excited, basically, that's the one where I felt very strongly, the feeling that I was watching someone with a low-grade disability. No judgement on that, no opinion on the trial, or allegations, or judgment, or anything like that. I don't even know if it's ongoing, or over, or hasn't started yet. No idea.

"*(why) do rightwingers have better friendships?*  Context: Dan, Mike, and I are all childhood friends. All 3 are cishet white males. Now, as adults in our thirties, we still hang out, but things between us are different.  Dan was always a shy, quiet guy, not exactly introverted (likes company of people but is never the center stage). Was kinda average at school, but got better over time and actually went to study and get a degree, so definitely not a dumb guy. I feel like he is extremely apolitical and has no strong opinions kn anything besides basic stuff like ""murder bad"" or ""rape bad"". He undoubtedly has a heart of gold and I feel like he intuitively knows good from bad.  Mike was, like me, the ""smart kid"", really loud, opinionated, good grades. Looking from today's perspective, that's where similarities end. Over time, he became very conservative, very religious, probably not very racist but pretty homo/transphobic, a sucker for Russian/Chinese propaganda. I OTOH became very liberal and left-leaning. I am very supportive of queer people, I kinda struggle agreeing with the non-binary/genderfluid/they/they/neopronoun and man-over-bear stuff, but I am very pro gay marriage and trans people transitioning, and I despise the Russian/Chinese propaganda. I am also irreligious and for stricter separation of church and state. Mike falls for rightwing propaganda like ""Netherlands has a pedophile party in Parliament"" and ""The Government pays 10000 for trans people transition surgery in Germany while our people hunger!""  Mike and I both value friendship and helping friends, but I feel like I can not stay friends with him when a lot of people I care about are asexual, bisexual, possibly trans. I can't stay friends with someone who feeds me lies instead of debating based on facts. I am not happy about it, but whatever.  I fear for Dan, however. Dan and Mike are likely closer than Dan and I am. One reason is that I went to study/work abroad, and rhe two of them hang out more often. I am grateful to Mike for being a great friend to Dan, but I fear what will happen if shit hits the fan and the left and right need to fight it out. I fear their friendship will end if Dan ever turns out to be gay/trans/finds a trans partner. And if not - I fear Dan and me drifting appart if he takes on the more conservative stances.  At the same time, I don't feel as close to my other liberal friends. We hang out and help each other in need, but I kinda feel it is superficial. If we are ever away, it is hard for them to contact me first and almost all communication is initiated by me.  My liberal friends and I have nothing resembling the friendship Dan and Mike have. And while Dan is not cinservative himself, I feel their friendship examplifies what I am trying to describe. As hateful as rightwingers/conservatives are, they are pretty close as long as nobody turns out gay or dates someone trans. Meanwhile, while my liberal friends are all for love and communism, they are pretty weak friends.    Before I realized this discrepancy in the ""amount of friendship"" I offer them and they offer me, I would have gladly given my kidney for all of them, and even now, I would consider it. But I honestly do not believe my liberal friends would give a kidney for me. Meanwhile, I believe wholeheartedly Mike would give his kidney for his conservative friends and even his life for Dan, and Dan would likely reciprocate.  I know this is a lotta rambling and I base this on my personal experience, but it is what it is.  Thanks!!",[deleted],2024-08-04T17:27:03,-2

"At what point does fighting discrimination become discrimination itself?  I‚Äôve always supported the fight against racism. Equal opportunity, fairness, and treating people based on their character rather than their skin color‚Äîthese are values I thought we all agreed on. For a long time, I believed the Democratic Party championed these principles. But lately, I‚Äôm confused and honestly, a little disheartened. It feels like the methods being used now don‚Äôt align with the original goal.  Take Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, for example. On paper, it sounds great‚Äîwho doesn‚Äôt want more inclusion? But when I look closer, it seems like they‚Äôre doing the very thing they used to fight against: making race the defining factor in decisions. Instead of fostering equality, it feels like we‚Äôre enforcing a system where opportunities are denied to some people simply because of their race, all in the name of diversity. How is that different from the discrimination we were trying to stop? I‚Äôm not saying there isn‚Äôt still work to do, but this approach feels counterproductive‚Äîand, frankly, unfair.  Then there‚Äôs the fight against fascism. Of course, no one wants fascism, but the way it‚Äôs being fought raises some questions for me. Censorship, deplatforming people, shutting down any opposing viewpoints‚Äîthese feel like the tactics of authoritarianism. I‚Äôve even seen people labeled as ‚ÄúNazis‚Äù just for having a different opinion. How is calling someone a Nazi, without engaging with their argument, a meaningful way to fight fascism? Isn‚Äôt silencing people and avoiding debate exactly what fascists do?  And here‚Äôs what really confuses me: Why does any mention of government efficiency get such a visceral reaction? I thought we all wanted a government that works better, serves people more effectively, and doesn‚Äôt waste money. But instead of real conversations about how to improve things, it feels like there‚Äôs more energy spent enforcing ideological purity than fixing actual problems. Why isn‚Äôt there more focus on making sure public services work, reducing bureaucracy, and holding institutions accountable? Shouldn‚Äôt that be a non-partisan issue?  I guess what I‚Äôm struggling with is this: where‚Äôs the logic and consistency? I want to see genuine, thoughtful efforts to improve things, not just ideological enforcement. I want to hear real debates about how to create fair opportunities for everyone‚Äînot just for groups who fit into a particular narrative. I feel like the focus has shifted from solving real problems to performing ideological purity tests, and I don‚Äôt understand how that helps anyone.  I‚Äôm not writing this to attack anyone, but to ask: where are we going with this? I want to believe that we‚Äôre all still working toward fairness and equality, but some of these methods feel like they‚Äôre doing the opposite. Can someone explain how this approach makes sense?

"A BUNCH of questions.   I'm at the age where I probably should start familiarize myself with the current political parties and their beliefs.  The debate between Kamala and Trump was the fist one I have ever watched and I'm confused about something that I hoping more experienced people can answer. For reference, I watched the debate on YouTube through the NBC channel, but they said it was ABC in the vid.  1. Why were a bunch of the questions directed at trump so specific and had negative underlying tones? They quoted him a lot and asked him about what he said, but they didn't do that to Kamala. 2. Why did Trump make such a weird claim about how immigrants were eating people pets. Don't get me wrong, it was weird, but it was almost too specific. I am fully aware of the immigrant crisis we are having, but have never heard about this pet thing.  3. In the 5-ish min breaks they had, they put a few headlines making trump look bad, but they didn't do anything with Kamala. Is this that weaponised media they talked about?  3a. The moderator fact checked Trump, but not Kamala. That's objectively not fair. They should fact check both of them. Why did they only do Trump? 4. Trump seemingly made a good point. Why hasn't Kamala done anything she claims she will do? She has the power to do what she says she will do now, but hasn't done it yet. Why? 5. Why did Trump use more number when talking and Kamala didn't?  6. Kamalas thing is the Opportunity Economy where she wants to help small independent businesses, new families, etc. But where will the money she says she will give these people come from? 7. Why did the woman moderator have way fewer questions than the guy? (Sorry, forgot names) Was he more qualified than her or smth? 8. Prices of everything were lower (in my experience) when Trump was in office compared to Biden. Kamala claims it was the opposite. Who in the Biden economy is benefiting from him? I'm from a low-income house, so does that mean rich people benefit from a democratic economy?  9. Where can I go to find the truth? I don't know who is actually telling it?  TLDR: I need somewhere to find objective political facts, not just claims and biases cuz idk what to beleive.",D1nky27,2024-09-11T19:35:49,-2
"TLDR; North Carolina bill mandates law enforcement to contact ICE before releasing an illegal immigrant if they‚Äôve committed a felony or violent misdemeanor. There are some leaders in the community and some democrats opposed to this.  My question: This seems like common sense to me. Why would anyone be opposed to deporting someone that has committed a serious and violent crime?       Can someone explain to me why House Bill 10 in North Carolina is ‚Äúcontroversial‚Äù to most Dem politicians? [Story with brief overview here](https://www.wral.com/story/nc-bill-would-mandate-sheriffs-cooperation-with-ice-in-felony-immigration-cases/21617783/)  From what I‚Äôve read, if someone commits a felony or class A1 (serious) misdemeanor, law enforcement must look up their immigration status, and must comply with an ICE detention request, so they can presumably be deported.  It seems to only apply for serious crimes like felonies, and class A1 misdemeanors like assault with a deadly weapon, child abuse, assault that causes serious injury.    It does not seem to include anything else like I‚Äôve normally seen mentioned for reasons against similar laws (typically driving with no license, not showing ID, etc.) as I understand how that could cause fear in immigrant communities. However, this bill only applies to violent crime where it‚Äôs harmful to let them back into the community.   Is there something hidden in the bill, or is this just an overreaction from NC democrats?  I‚Äôm sure there will be a reply ascribing it to ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the looney left for ya‚Äù but I want to find out a real answer to this. I want to understand the mindset behind opposing it.  **If my understanding of the bill is correct, why would anyone be genuinely opposed to deporting someone for murder, rape, or assault with serious injury?**",Complex-Employ7927,2024-09-21T23:15:04,-4

Do you think it's time to just disband Democratic Party? Because if it's true that Latin American men, black men, men in ethnic minority in general, Gen Z men, Gen Z women, and so on all voted for Trump, which apparently means that Democratic Party has no solid base whatsoever anymore, then it might well be the time for the party to cease to exist and its members to join Green Party or Libertarian Party depending on where their politics lie or maybe just join Republican Party and turn the entire country into a dominant-party rule in which Republican Party would become the American version of Liberal Democratic Party of Japan.

"Something that came up to my mind - could the recent surge for Trump's support and Harris' support going down is due to North Korea sending 12,000 troops to Ukraine to fight alongside with Russia and people decided that Trump is the only one who can convince North Korea to stop doing such thing - and possibly even convince Russia to step away from North Korea?  To give you guys further ideas, they might think that North Korea sending troops to Ukraine to help Russia is proof that North Korea and Russia is about to invade South Korea together in a matter of weeks, if not days given that North Korea is helping an invader that is Russia due to that North Korea-Russia alliance pact that they had few months ago and lead to World War III and decided that Trump is the only one who can stop them.

"How are the french women's day protests not fascist?   I've been trying to post for this clarification all over reddit with very little success, please go easy on me.   Ok. French women were protesting on women's day, I'm sure many have seen the video with the boobs. Here's what I don't get;   How does one protest a thing they are visually supporting?  Sure, they're messages in interviews and articles are clear. They're protesting fascism, sexism, pay inequality, etc. But what about their actions on the street during the core of the video? The swastikas on the chest, the salute, these tell me they are in support of fascism and prejudice.   Iirc, They call out support to Musk and Putin, which would put these two in a dark spotlight. But, doesn't it also put all these women in the same spotlight? If these women arent real fascists then i supppse niether is musk or putin because they are voicing their support? Maybe it's because I'm not french?   Maybe if I saw one person of color among the chanting  protesters, if they were chanting something in opposition to fascism I might not be so confused.  I know if I went out to the streets like this, doing the same exact actions, I firmly believe I would  not get the same positive response. Even if I announced my intentions beforehand.

"> Why are Trump supporters ignoring all of the warnings from our country's most senior and respected leaders?  This may help explain why some Trump supporters don't trust politicians and or respect leaders like Gen. Mark Milley (Ret.), who said in 2023:   >  In the broader sense, the war [in Afghanistan] was lost. We were fighting the Taliban and their allies for 20-plus years. And they prevailed in that capital for a lot of reasons. . . Wars aren't lost in the last 10 days or 10 months. Typically, they're the cumulative effect of lots of turns and twists over many, many years. And this war, when the final history is written, will prove to be the same. Lots of lessons learned. Lots of lefts when you should have gone right. And that'll all come out in due time. But lots of regrets, absolutely, 100%.  The Free Press recently hosted a debate on the subject ""Should the U.S. Still Police the World?‚Äù  Matt Taibbi was one of the panelists, and following the debate he wrote:   > [W]e‚Äôve suffered numerous humiliations at the hands of more furious and determined adversaries in Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan, to say nothing of disasters like our Libyan engagement. The common theme has been politicians betraying soldiers by saddling them with unjust or unclear missions, against people fighting on their own land for their lives and families. . .  > [T]raveling around the U.S. in the 2016 cycle I met soldiers who showed up at Donald Trump‚Äôs rallies in larger and larger numbers. Some were responding to his ‚Äúendless wars‚Äù rhetoric, others said they were just curious. Many had been stop-lossed into multiple unexpected tours, or had been injured or seen friends die in an idiotic war, and then come home to find VA services in tatters and economic opportunities hollowed out.  > They were pissed, more than anything at politicians and intellectuals who asked for sacrifice without making it themselves. Far more than the 2008 financial crisis, it‚Äôs America‚Äôs moronic wars that drive anger toward ‚Äúelites.""  In summary, then, it seems some Trump supporters have simply lost confidence in intellectuals and politicians who ask for sacrifice without making it themselves, and who betray soldiers by saddling them with unjust or unclear missions in 20-year wars that are ultimately lost because ""there are lots of lefts when you should have gone right.""",KSDem,2024-10-13T20:34:48,-1

You're essentially asking ""Why if it was a lab leak is anyone interested in discovering this?"" Because it was a global disaster and people are rightfully interested in knowing how it happened.  Additionally, Fauci strongly downplayed the lab leak hypothesis and also denied US was involved in gain of function research. Without litigating the case here, there's reason to believe Fauci downplayed the lab leak hypothesis specifically because he was involved in getting the funding for it.

"The no new wars is bullshit way of rephrasing what actually happened under his admin.  Yes there wasn't a new war started under his admin.

Yemen was escalated as counterterrorism activities and support for the Saudi led war increased. So much congress passed a historic war resolution in an attempt to curb his involvement in the theater since 50k Yemenis were killed with 20 million displaced.

He had harsh things to say about Montenegro's potential NATO membership, but it's important to note that he didn't actually do anything to try to block it.  And of course there's the weapons shipment to Ukraine. What most people remember (for good reason) is him trying to use the shipment to get dirt on the Bidens. But we can't forget that the shipment was weapons, including Javelin anti-tank missiles that proved key in thwarting the Russian invasion. By comparison, the Obama administration did not send weapons to Ukraine, even after Russia invaded Crimea.

They don't really believe that the elections are rigged. It's just something they say to justify violence.,__zagat__,2024-10-23T09:04:35,6
"It helps to get into the details of what the allegations are. And I haven't followed any newer stuff, so I'm just going to speak generally here, drawing from the allegations around 2020.  The claims about election rigging aren't that the final result is locked in by some corrupt people at the top of the system.  Instead, it's that smaller scale issues could happen with the *potential* to flip a state and change the outcome of the election. Think for instance about a state election board changing the rules at the last minute to allow mail-in ballots that were postmarked too late and in a context where the state knows it's going to be close and the mail-in ballots are going to strongly favor one candidate over another.  That might get an allegation of ""rigging"" because it seems to be changing the rules to favor one candidate. *But*, it'd still make sense for the candidate making the allegation to encourage people to vote because the decision is still coming down to the vote count -- the ""rigging"" just has to do with deciding whether a small percentage of votes would be counted or not.  Similarly, we could go the other political direction and imagine a state where one party is shutting down polling places in districts that heavily favor the opposing party. That could be called ""rigging,"" but it still makes sense to encourage people to get out and vote. They're not rigging the vote tally, but trying to get less of one side to vote, so you counter that by showing up to vote regardless.  It's also worth noting that many things that get calling ""rigging"" an election have nothing to do with trying to let in more or fewer votes at all. Lots of times biased media coverage will get called ""rigging"" an election. That allegation has been made around the suppression of the Hunter Biden laptop story. Or I could cite Bernie supporters who've used ""rigged"" language to refer to Hillary getting debate questions in advance, or Buttigieg dropping out and endorsing Biden before Super Tuesday.  So that's the long answer.  The short answer is that ""rigging"" tends to refer to attempts to put a thumb on the scale, but that thumb can't overcome a decisive advantage.  And if you want a sports analogy (because who doesn't!), imagine the refs ""rigging"" a football game. There's lots of close calls when it comes to penalties, so some questionable things get called against one team, don't get called against the other. At halftime, the coach goes into the locker room and everyone is aware of what's going on. What does he tell his team, to just pack it in and leave? No. He tells them to go out there and play harder so it doesn't matter what the refs are doing. Don't have to worry about the ref not calling defensive pass interference in your favor if your wide receiver just blows past the coverage and doesn't have a defender near him to interfere in the first place.",bl1y,2024-10-23T10:01:15,0

What is it that they do that you think is good?  There's a good chance that the stuff you named won't be eliminated. Student loans will be moved to the SBA, and programs for special needs children and nutrition programs will be moved to HHS. States will continue to receive funding, but with less strings attached.  Trump's goal (at least his purported goal) is to save money by cutting the Department's 4,000+ workers, and to give more control over education spending to the states.  >clean water act  Didn't get rid of the Clean Water Act, which is a law passed by Congress in 1972. His executive order got rid of the Clean Water *Rule*, which is an EPA regulation from 2015. This rule is about the definition of Waters of the United States. Traditionally, WOTUS refers only to navigable bodies of water, since that falls under Congress's authority to regulate interstate commerce. It wouldn't apply to, say, a wetland that isn't connected to any navigable river. The CWR expanded the definition, and it's been pretty contentious.  Say you're a developer and have a piece of property with a small wetland not connected to any other body of water. May you fill that in and build an apartment complex? Traditionally, that wouldn't have been considered a WOTUS, but under the CWR we have to ask stuff like whether or not that wetland falls within a river's 100 year flood plain.  Basically the tradeoff here is between greater environmental protection and more restrictions and cost on development.  >dei  This is a huge can of worms, so I'll sum it up by saying there's basically two versions of DEI. The first is benign DEI that's just about making sure certain groups aren't excluded from education and the workforce and aren't made to feel unwelcome. Then there is pernicious DEI, which is an ideology based on the view that America is fundamentally and permanently racist and that the primary way to view the world is an oppressor/oppressed dynamic.  On the benign end, you might have something like a company recognizing that it over-recruits from the alma maters of its managers, which incidentally results in racial disparities, so the company broadens its recruitment efforts and makes sure to include HBCUs.  On the pernicious end you get stuff like the nutty [Elimination of Harmful Language Initiative](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/stanfordlanguage.pdf) which has a lot of bizarre stuff, but my favorite is to not call US Citizens ""Americans,"" because that's too US-centric a term; there's the [Smithsonian White Culture](https://www.newsweek.com/smithsonian-race-guidelines-rational-thinking-hard-work-are-white-values-1518333) nonsense, which says that when a Black person uses the scientific method, saves for retirement, or is just polite, that's actually internalized white culture; and billions of dollars spent every year on diversity training that actually ends up [increasing racial tensions](https://networkcontagion.us/wp-content/uploads/Instructing-Animosity_11.13.24.pdf).  >What's he even gonna use this money for anyway??  There haven't been a lot of specifics, in large part because we don't know how much the savings will be.

They will parrot whatever policies Trump is currently espousing, but they will immediately change their support if Trump does.   To your original question: Today's conservatives are comfortable engaging in the kind of openly hypocritical behaviors you're describing, because they no long value things like dignity, honesty or integrity. They used to value those things, because society does. But they have jettisoned those values, because Donald Trump has demonstrated that you can do so, and there really isn't much society can do in response, other than frown at you.

"> Why is it that when people are concerned that voters won‚Äôt come out to vote, it‚Äôs assumed to be an advantage to the Republican nominee?  Because the type of people who vote in every election tend to be older on average, and older people are more likely to vote Republican. There are various reasons theorized why older people vote more consistently:  1. They're often retired, so they have a lot more free time to go vote. 2. They probably don't have young kids in their house to take care of, so once again, more free time. 3. They're more likely to have lived in their community for a long time, which makes them more likely to want to have a say in state/local issues. Younger people are more likely to have moved around a bit because of education, early career, getting married, maybe starting a family, etc., so they're less likely to have a strong attachment to their community. 4. Older people have had a whole lifetime of social pressure to vote and have had a chance to develop it into a habit.  > Is it because there‚Äôs THAT many more hardcore Republican voters than Democrat voters?

"I'll give Ben Shapiro's take on it, since he's a prominent conservative commentator and has gotten his position down pretty succinctly:  Healthcare (and a lot of things, really) is a balancing act between three competing interests (1) cost, (2) quality, and (3) universality. You can pick two of them, but will suffer on the third. If you want it universal and affordable, quality will suffer.  Of course a hiccup in his analysis is that we're both expensive and not universal -- we're at about 92% (and some of the remaining 8% could get insurance but for a variety of reasons don't).  Health*care* in the US is generally very good. We have shorter wait times for specialists than a lot of European countries, and do very well on cancer survival rates. While the cost is obviously a sore point for most people, it's hard to gain popular support for lowering cost and simultaneously lowering quality.  For one example, the US has a 90% 5 year survival rate for breast cancer compared to 86% in the UK.

"Those are the parts that get clipped and make the rounds on social media. The majority of hearings are pretty normal. You're probably seeing the worst 1% of the hearings, if it's even that high.  But why do some people act like that? A few reasons.  Some members are hoping for moments that will go viral and help get them some national recognition, probably with an eye towards pursuing the presidency or a cabinet position.  Sometimes they're just assholes.  But often it's because the witnesses are being unresponsive and the members usually only have 5 minutes to ask questions (which includes time spent getting answers).  As a recent example, we had the head of the Secret Service testify about the Trump assassination attempt. A huge portion of her responses were to just refer the Senator to the FBI since they're the ones investigating. For instance, that's the response she gave when asked how many shots were fired, and then how many shell casings were recovered. Later in the hearing another senator had the insight to ask if she'd talked to the FBI about the shooting. She had. Then the senator asked if the FBI told her how many shell casings were recovered. It did. Would she say what the number was? No, they'd have to ask the FBI.  And very often the witnesses will do what has become known as filibustering. They'll launch into long-winded non-responses. Just as a (hypothetical) example:  ""What is your name?""  ""Thank you for the question, senator. Before I was born, my parents considered a number of different choices for my name, both for if I was a boy or a girl...""  ""Reclaiming my time. Is your name on your birth certificate?""  ""It is.""  ""Can you tell me what your birth certificate says?""  ""Thank you for the question, senator. I don't have my birth certificate here today, but I can certainly have my staff provide you with a copy of it.""  Now you might be wondering why they bother if witnesses aren't going to be responsive. Well, most are, and they don't always know who is going to act like that before a hearing, though often they can suspect. But the point then is basically to cause embarrassment for the person not answering. These hearings do actually matter to people, especially people in powerful positions. Following questioning of university presidents about their responses to anti-Semitism on campus, a few were pressured into resigning.

"Quite frankly, people like this always piss me off. They refuse to vote, then get angry when nothing changes. The voting block is who decides the system. Currently, the main voting block is old white people. They like the system. It's built for them. Do you know why more black candidates and candidates pushing black issues don't get pushed up more often? Because black voters don't show up. It's not worth a candidates limited time to go to communities where they won't get a large new voting block. Take Mississippi. That state could easily be the bluest state in the US, with a 37% black population. But because black voters don't turnout, no Democrat ever focuses on the state.

With a few exceptions, US law tends to follow the principle that a level of intent is required in order to be convicted of a crime. The ""loophole"" she's talking about is an exception to the law that imposes criminal penalties when any alien (legal or not) votes in a federal election. The exception essentially says that if an alien is a permanent resident in the US from childhood (before the age of 16), has US citizen parents, and reasonably believes that he/she is also a US citizen, then that person can't be criminally punished for voting. The intent to perform the act of voting as an alien just isn't there in that circumstance, so it's unreasonable to impose fines/imprisonment for it. That doesn't mean it's legal for them to vote.

If you leave the airport with a suitcase that looks like your but is actually someone else's, you didn't commit a crime, you committed a mistake.  Likewise with the situation being described here. If a non-citizen mistakenly believes they are a citizen and votes, they won't be punished. And that's as it should be.  Engelbrecht calls this a ""loophole"" that makes it so non-citizens can vote, but what she's obviously overlooking is that no court in the country will think you just oopsied on not knowing your citizenship status.

In the last century, only 1 election had more than 1 faithless elector, and that was 2016. There were 10, but they were overwhelmingly Democratic electors.  Before that, there was at most 1 per election. Probably the best one is in 2004, ""John Ewards"" received 1 vote.

"Just going to add some more detail to the answer from /u/silentparadox2   With the Senate, elections are staggered such that only 1 senator from any state is being elected in a single election (save the rare exception for special elections to fill a vacancy). So it is possible that we'll have states with senators from two different parties based on political changes in the 2-4 years since the last race (they have 6 year terms).  The House and Senate have ""equal"" power in terms that majorities in both are needed to pass legislation. However, the Senate is generally considered to have more power because they (and not the House) confirm Cabinet members, federal judges, and some other top positions. The House has a unique power in that spending bills must originate there. Then they have different duties in impeachment, with the House basically indicting and the Senate acting as the jury.  For the Electoral College, each state has a number of votes equal to their number of members in Congress, so a minimum of 1 member of the House and 2 in the Senate. DC also has 3 votes in the EC, though none in Congress (they have non-voting delegates). Also with the Electoral College, while technically it is the electors who vote for President, they follow the results of the state they're from.

He hated doing the job. He hated daily intelligence briefings to the point where his advisors had to shorten the meetings and use a lot of visual aids to keep his attention. He hated the demands on his time, having to attend memorials and services (it's notable that some of the most objectionable things he has said, like the ""losers and suckers"" bit, were when he was forced to do something he didn't want to do.) The White House website makes Presidential schedules public, and Trump's schedule usually didn't start until 10am, and ended by 4pm.

"A lot of the people trying to enter the US through the southern border aren't Mexican but people from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Venezuela fleeing gang and political violence, economic problems, and environmental disasters in their own countries. If they go through the correct processes to enter the US, they can try to petition for asylum--if it's granted, they're considered refugees and their immigration is legal. During covid, the US closed the border and temporarily stopped processing asylum applications. This meant that a lot of these migrants--who were very far from their homes--just sat on the Mexico side of the border for months, under bad conditions, during a pandemic ... and eventually plenty of them decided to just attempt to cross into the US illegally rather than wait for the legal refugee process. That's why encounters with border patrol went up.  The border restrictions started to ease in late 2021, but even after that, there was obviously a backlog of people to process at the border. And once the borders opened again, then a lot of migrants who had been holding off on traveling to the border (because they knew they wouldn't be let through) made the journey, so there was a new surge of people coming. Since covid happened, there's just a very big backlog to work through--and the bigger the backlog, the more people give up on entering legally and just try to enter however they can.

It follows that if the appeal of the conspiracy is emotional, that only emotional reasoning is going to disrupt that appeal. That is an uphill battle, because convincing somebody to reject the conspiracy requires you to convince them they have been a fool, which is something most people will go to absurd lengths to avoid. Your best bet in this situation is to try to understand what your Mother finds appealing in this belief system. What underlying fear (it is usually fear) does these beliefs address, or what underlying emotional attraction do they address. But to do that, you would have to sit down and listen to her talk about this stuff, which can be really hard to do. It is hard to listen to somebody you love talk a bunch of crazy, in a patient and accepting way.   On the bright side, most conspiracy theorists are cyclic. It is very likely there will come a time when her current belief system grows old and boring. When the zeitgeist moves on, the slow drip of new ""information"" dries up. At that point she is likely to lose interest in Dr.Fauci and the coronavirus, and move on to a new, more engaging idea. If you can recognize that inflection point, you have some chance of introducing a new and hopefully healthier enthusiasm. As with most behavioral habits, it's very hard to quit a behavior, but it is much easier to replace it with another.   I'm genuinely sorry you have to deal with this.

"*Some* of what she's saying has *some* factual basis, but far from supporting the insane conclusions.  The Wuhan Institute of Virology did open during Obama's presidency and did receive funds from the US (iirc, indirectly through another organization the US funds). And was that lab involved in gain of function research? This gets pretty messy and gets into a lot of technical definitions -- some of which have changed. But my understanding is that the Fauci position is essentially equivalent to saying they didn't fund making ice cream because the lab makes gelato, which up until 2 minutes ago was considered to be a form of ice cream.  Where she absolutely breaks with reality is the claim that Covid-19 was released to overthrow Trump. Why would Obama have started that project in 2014, a year before Trump declared his candidacy, and at a time when Democrats were confident Clinton would stomp whoever the Republicans ran?  Why would China release the disease *in China*? Wouldn't it make sense to release it into the US? None of that makes any sense.  Where she can get within sight of reality though is that many Democrats anticipated that the weak economy would cost Trump the election and that likely influenced their position on how strict and lengthy the lockdowns should be.

"There are 3 types of trump voters as far as I can tell.  1. The true believers. They genuinely do not think the things he did are a problem, they like the things he is saying/doing, and genuinely believe the Democrats are ruining the country. These are the red cap, hard-core MAGA voters.  2. Always red voters. They don't care about what Trump did, or think it was overblown, and will always vote Republican.

They do think some of the things Trump did/said are distasteful, but typically not to the point of illegality. They are dissatisfied with the system and want change, so they vote for the guy who is bringing change, regardless of if it's good or bad. These were the swing voters. With the economic reactions to covid still hanging over our heads, people were feeling more stressed about the economy, so Trump saying he would do something radical and different (tariffs) is able to get their interest, even if it's a shit idea (also tariffs). I think a lot of these people also have seen evidence of Trump lying before, so they twist it in their heads to ""he probably won't actually introduce a bunch of tariffs, he'll do something else"". You can exchange tariffs for whatever policy you want; they're basically seeing whatever they want in him and dismissing the rest as silly ol' Trump.

The only country that would try to stop the US is China.  The treaty that gave Panama the canal specified that it had to remain under Panamanian control. Currently the canal itself is controlled by Panama, but the ports at either end are owned by a company based out of Hong Kong, which you may recall reverted back to Chinese control. The area the ports are in are included in the treaty. At pretty much any time the Communist Party could seize control of the port company, and thus take effective control over the canal.  It's unclear if Panama is presently in violation of the treaty since the CCP isn't at the moment in control of the port company.

"An awful lot of people have wasted a lot of time and effort trying to fathom what Trump thinks or exactly what his ideology might be.   Personally, I think he's pretty obvious. He's motivated almost entirely by self interest and he's a bully. As with any bully, there are really only two ways of effectively dealing with him, to end his efforts at bullying. You stroke his ego (as Mexico seems to have done), or you can stand up to him (as China is doing and Europe may do). The first one has the least chance of harm, but the most chance for the bully to revert to type and start bullying again. The second one is more effective in the long term, but presents the possibility of a protracted, damaging fight, before it ends.   It should be noted in this current mess, that much of Trump's focus seems to be on Mexico, Canada and China, because those are our largest trading partners. Those are also the same countries he got in a fracas with the last time he was President, when he signed new trade deals with them and claimed to have ""won"". So it is very clear now that even if some countries appease Trump, and give him whatever trade deal it is he wants, there is no guarantee he won't turn around and start the whole cycle all over again. So there really is no strategic value in appeasing him. This means most countries will see no option but to fight.   That fight won't do Trump any real harm (except harming his political capital), but it will do a great deal of harm to American consumers.

His logic is that by having the tariffs, it'll force companies to build factories in the US and once they set up the supply chain here its difficult to abandon it.   Problem is that for tariffs to work they need to be consistent, effectively costly (I've heard the number 200% thrown around), and long term. All three of which are not happening under Trumps watch.

"There‚Äôs an ultimate check mate to this argument because their beliefs change with Trumps decisions on a whim and the supposed benefits are contradictory. None of the benefits below are true but I‚Äôd corner him on these facts.   Are tariffs good on their own merits or are they a negotiating tool? You can‚Äôt say tariffs are good then also say when Trump removes them we scored some great deal. If they are good their should be no ask to remove them, why remove a good thing? Trump will constantly flip on this and his base will change their minds every day. Here‚Äôs the contradiction.  Tariffs are good-  Tariffs make other goods so expensive people will have to buy American, this will bring American jobs. So if that‚Äôs the case inflation is going way up.   Tariffs will bring in revenue reducing deficit/ removing income tax. Direct contradiction to point one. To bring in revenue we‚Äôd still need to buy foreign goods. If we keep buying foreign goods no bringing jobs home. We are just paying a sales tax to raise revenue.   ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no tariffs if you just buy American‚Äù. Well why were you buying foreign goods in the first place? Answer is they are cheaper so paying more even if you avoid the tariffs is sort of self defeating to the point.  Tariffs are just a negotiating tool-   If tariffs are a tool to reduce other peoples tariffs and establish free trade then free trade is good?   If that‚Äôs the goal how are we bringing back manufacturing jobs with tariffs if the end goal results in removing tariffs.   How are we going to collect massive tariff revenue of countries ‚Äúcave‚Äù to our demands?  Other points why tariffs are just bad and this ideology of self sufficiency won‚Äôt work-  Unemployment rate is at around 4%. Where are we going to get the workers to start production T shirts, appliances, ship building, farmers‚Ä¶ enough workers to produce everything in the world when most people are already working. Extra problem when you plan to deport people and shrink the working population.   If we need to make other goods more expensive for domestic to compete and pay more for domestic where does that money flow from? The crux of tariffs here. You have finite money. You say I‚Äôd pay more for American goods. What are you going to spend less on then? Those companies really get hurt by tariffs. Ones that were competitive without government assistance because Americans are spending more money on tariffed goods there‚Äôs less money to go around to other companies.   You can create good jobs or cheap goods, not both. You are not going to create high paying manufacturing jobs and have those same jobs output cheap products. You have to accept either you‚Äôre going to have to get people to work shitty low pay jobs somehow or experience major inflation.   Over 50% of imports to the US are inputs into American manufacturing companies. Tariffing goods makes American manufacturing more expensive. It‚Äôs not just driving the price up of cheap Chinese knick nacks, it‚Äôs driving up the price of everything we do build.   If trade itself is bad for the US and a zero sum game why stop there? States should tariff each other to make themselves rich.

Most of the forecasts have the House either in a dead heat or a slight advantage to Republicans, and a strong advantage for Republicans in the Senate. So, for a lot of voters the question is less about the specific individual in the White House and more about whether they want a President who will approve the Republican agenda or oppose it.  There's also an important social question at play. While the President doesn't have much formal power when it comes to social issues, a win by Harris will embolden the progressives to push harder on their agenda, while a win by Trump signals that the progressives are too radical and may push more independents and moderate Democrats to tone things down.

"TL;DR: Yes, it specifically proposes removing protections against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity multiple times.  Not sure how much background you're familiar with, but in 2020, the Supreme Court ruled in Bostock v. Clayton County that employers discriminating against employees/job applicants based on their gender identity or sexual orientation was a form of sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. This ruling is specific to sex discrimination in employment and didn't automatically carry over to other laws prohibiting sex discrimination in different contexts.  Since Biden became president in 2021, some executive agencies responsible for enforcing various other sex discrimination laws have adapted their interpretations of sex discrimination to encompass discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation based on the reasoning used in the Bostock decision. Project 2025 explicitly calls for a reversal of these agency rule changes. They know they probably can't do anything about the Bostock decision in the short term, but they propose that it be applied as narrowly as possible and that it be pushed to the bottom of the priority list in terms of enforcement.  Their general position is laid out on page 584-585 of the Project 2025 document you linked, but you can find references to specific programs elsewhere in the document. The ones I saw were related to the Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Education prohibitions against discrimination by federally-funded health care providers and federally-funded schools respectively.  From Page 584-585:  > **Restrict the application of Bostock.** The new Administration should restrict Bostock‚Äôs application of sex discrimination protections to sexual orientation and transgender status in the context of hiring and firing.  > **Withdraw unlawful ‚Äúnotices‚Äù and ‚Äúguidances.‚Äù** The President should direct agencies to withdraw unlawful ‚Äúnotices‚Äù and ‚Äúguidances‚Äù purporting to apply Bostock‚Äôs reasoning broadly outside hiring and firing.  > **Rescind regulations prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, transgender status, and sex characteristics.** The President should direct agencies to rescind regulations interpreting sex discrimination provisions as prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, transgender status, sex characteristics, etc.  > **Direct agencies to refocus enforcement of sex discrimination laws.** The President should direct agencies to focus their enforcement of sex discrimination laws on the biological binary meaning of ‚Äúsex.‚Äù  Prior to Bostock, the Obama administration attached nondiscrimination conditions to federal funding for adoption agencies, preventing faith-based adoption agencies that accept federal funding from rejecting same-sex couples just because their marriage conflicts with the religious beliefs of the agency.

"As I'm not a young person I will not speak for them, but historically Biden has been far more supportive of Israel than the average D.C. establishment pol.  \~40 years ago in the early 1980's there was a flashpoint and Biden (having been in the US Senate for about a decade at that point) was pushing the Israeli's to go hard after the Palestinians. So much so that both the then PM of Israel and then US President Reagan had to tell him there weren't going to be that extreme and to chill out.  He's never wavered in his extreme support for Israel until just recently and it's clear that is only because it might be hurting his re-election chances.  So if you're someone who thinks the USA should not be supporting Israel, Biden is worse than the typical US president in recent decades.  If you're trying to argue that Trump will not be any better, then yes, but some people don't buy into supporting the lesser of two evils and feel like the only way to get the Democrats (because the GOP is a lost cause) to listen to them is to make them lose elections.  And frankly there is a lot of truth in that strategy; The only way to get politicians to do what you want is to either be wealthy enough to bribe them or to make them fear for their jobs.  That's how ""MAGA"" ( in quotes because I'm using it as a catchall for the various anti-establishment voters in the GOP coalition) took over the Republican Party; After Obama got elected they realized they had been getting played by the GOP establishment so they started taking out establishment pols in the primaries even if it meant that they would be weaker candidates in the general election and lose to the Dems. After they did that several times the GOP establishment got scared and fell in line with MAGA.

"Looking at the CNN article about Pelosi, this was a phone call. More people than the two were on the call; we don't know who exactly, but at some point one of Biden's advisors was asked to join. It wouldn't be uncommon for either person to have staff members listening to the call.  CNN's source is ""according to four sources briefed on the call.""  Keyword here is ""briefed."" They did not listen to the call themselves, but were told about it.  And a very important thing that we're not told is if these four sources received the same briefing. For instance, did a Pelosi aid tell four other staffers in one meeting, or did a Pelosi aid tell one staffer, and a Biden aid told another staffer, and someone else told someone, and these are four independent reports?  It's important to pay attention to the specific wording used in the articles because they're usually factually correct, but aren't always honest depictions of the sourcing.  A good example is back in the 2016 primaries. It was widely reported that Sanders said to Warren that a woman couldn't be President. I can't recall the outlets specifically but probably was CNN (because that's the site I read). The stories said that was told to them by four people (iirc) ""familiar with the conversation."" Digging a bit deeper though, it was clear it was a private conversation with only Sanders and Warren in the room. It's likely that she told some of her staffers, who then told the press. So in truth it wasn't four different people saying that's what Sanders said, but rather one person --Warren-- who made that claim, which was then repeated by four different people who did not hear the conversation themselves. They spun it to sound like Sanders was saying a woman couldn't do the job, but most likely he said there's too much sexism for a woman to win the vote, totally different things. Warren then mischaracterized the conversation to her staff, which went to the press, and suddenly the press has four seemingly credible sources (they're familiar with the conversation!) confirming that Sanders is a sexist who thinks a woman can't do the job.  Doesn't answer your question about these specific reports about Pelosi and Obama, but this is the typical way sourcing on these types of things works. Someone with first hand knowledge tells someone else, and then that person goes to the press, and the press reports it without making it clear that the story is hearsay. Very often the hearsay is true, but not always.  When it's not true though, we can expect the subject of the story to deny the claim. When there is no denial and the story is major news, usually safe to assume it is accurate. I don't think Biden, Obama, or Pelosi have denied these claims and they'd each have good reason to if it was false.",bl1y,2024-07-19T09:29:58,2
"Often, ""leaks"" are intentional. In this case, the leaks are probably either being done by Pelosi/Biden or with their permission.

Like, last weekend it was reported that Schumer went to Biden at home and told him ""privately"" that he needed to leave the race. So that was a conversation between just the two of them. And we still found out about it. So clearly one of the two of them leaked it to the press, and it probably wasn't Biden.",anneoftheisland,2024-07-19T11:25:08,2

"When Trump was running against Joe Biden, he was completely in his element: Biden was easy to attack, both as a sitting president who could easily be blamed for the nation's issues, his incoherence and his age were easy targets, and Biden just generally wasn't articulate enough to defend himself against Trump's force of will.   In that context, Trump had nothing to gain by picking a running mate who'd grab the spotlight‚Äî the more attention on the Biden Administration struggling with the issues, the better. He also didn't need to pick another Pence to stop Conservatives from defecting, since Trump's attacks and embracing of partisanship had already solidified his base. Really, all Trump needed was a second Trump, who would reaffirm the MAGA agenda without causing too much of a stir.   I thought at the time that the knockout choice would have been Nikki Haley, who could have protected Trump from his biggest Achilles' Heel at the time (Trump's approval of overturning Roe v. Wade) by giving him a redemtion of sorts with female voters, while also letting him appeal to the kind of Compassionate-Conservative groups that voted for Romney and McCain who wouldn't turn out unless Trump broadened his appeal. Knowing what I know now has only reinforced my beliefs, but I also recognize that Trump didn't want to compromise his agenda if he was obviously going to win‚Äî and there were only a few things he needed.   Here comes the real answer to your question. Firstly, Vance is from a Midwestern state. That's a big plus in most elections, but for Trump‚Äî whose populist rhetoric risks traditional conservative states like North Carolina and Georgia in exchange for chances of winning big Midwest states like Michigan and Pennsylvania‚Äî winning in that region is effectively necessary for the success of his campaign. Speaking of rhetoric, Vance is also the ultimate populist‚Äî even saying his favorite Democrats are the ""Bernie Bros,"" an unheard-of take by a Republican in a national election. His selection removes any and all doubt that Trump has compromised his views after his loss, and helped to further the wedge between populist and establishment Democrats that plagued Hillary Clinton's campaign against him in 2016 and seemed like it would keep key Democrat groups home in a race between Trump and Biden.   And finally, though Vance was a former opponent of Trump, he has since become one of his most avid supporters, and agrees with him on almost every issue. While Vances differences with Trump on abortion and problematic rhetoric about family values have made that Achilles' Heel an even bigger target, back when the Republican line was about fixing the Biden economy and getting out of Ukraine, Vance would have had no issue to deviate from Trump on. He seemed exactly like what Trump needed: a running mate that was politically alike and noncontroversial.   As an added bonus, I'll compare him with Walz. They're both Midwestern folk, but while Walz is an ex-coach and has that compassionate, neighborly rhetoric that the Harris campaign has emphasized, Vance was educated at Yale Law School and is of the Republican-intellectual class you don't hear too much about lately. If you read how his interview with the New York Times went back in August, you'll find his reasoning to be much more logical and reasoned‚Äî not necessarily factual, but definitely much more organized and rational than Trump's speeches, which tend to be more casual and freeform, more about Trump than Trump's policies. Most importantly, this reinforced the idea that Vance's airtight logic would prevent any gaffes, and had the election topics stayed on the logical-reasoning economy argument rather than the more sympathy-driven abortion debate I have no doubt that Vance would have succeeded in this goal.

"There's basically four things that go into a VP choice:  (1) Demographic balance. This is the obvious one people talk about, and what you seem to be asking about here. Vance is young and may play well with Midwest and rural voters.  (2) Campaign surrogate. The candidate wants someone who can do three shows a night. I haven't seen Vance at a rally, so I've got no idea how effective her is here (but I'm sure the comments will assure you that he's an absolute shitshow, regardless of how he actually plays to a crowd).  (3) Ability to take over for the President. This tends to get downplayed because no candidate wants to run on ""I might die in a couple years."" But, with certain candidates like Trump, Biden, and McCain, this is on voters' minds. Vance's experience is a detriment here, but I think voters believe he'd largely continue with Trump's agenda (as opposed to picking someone like Haley).  And then here's the one that no one actually talks about  (4) Administration agent. VP picks are not just about the campaign, but also having someone who will be effective in helping implement the President's agenda. Pretty similar considerations to 3. Bush picked Cheney as a political operation and Obama picked Biden in large part because of his experience and connections in Congress. Vance doesn't have much experience, but Trump views him as someone who would be a loyal surrogate.",bl1y,2024-09-12T09:26:07,2

"> unless they are billionaires or corporations, Trump only lowered their taxes temporarily.  Republican voters could rightfully blame Democrats for this. Republicans were forced to use the reconciliation process to bypass the filibuster since Democrats wouldn't support the tax cuts. Reconciliation bills have a lot of rules for what's allowed to be in them, and one of those rules is that a reconciliation bill can't have anything in it that increases the deficit after 10 years. They had to set an expiration date on a lot of the tax cuts in order to comply with this rule. If they manage to get a trifecta again, then I'm guessing they would extend it.  >  Taxes for everyone except corporations and billionaires are increasing yearly from 2021 to 2027 per instructions  Nothing in the tax bill expires until the end of 2025, so nobody will see a tax increase until 2026.  > The Trump tax bill drastically reduced the amount of state tax a middle-class family could write off in their federal tax.  This probably doesn't affect most middle class families, so not a huge concern. You need some combination of a lot of income, a lot of valuable property, and a high state tax rate to hit the limit.  > Tariffs are a sales tax and economics predict Trump's tariffs (which he can do without Congress) will add on average ~$4000 in costs to the average family  True.  > no tax on tips, ok now CEOS are paid in tips;  This would never work.  > Trump's tax will drastically increased deficit spending.  Yes, but they blame the bloated federal government for the spending problem, and the Republicans are running on gutting it. History says they won't actually do it, but Republican voters still believe they might some day.  > All of these things, he would have to get through Congress as would Harris have to get her policies (except tariffs)  Many of Trump's policies can be passed via reconciliation if they manage a trifecta. A lot of Harris's policies can't be passed via reconciliation, so they would either need to secure 60 votes in the Senate or get enough support to eliminate the filibuster entirely, both of which are more difficult.",Moccus,2024-09-24T11:50:58,0

"First things first, if you're experiencing daily anxiety about this, you should probably look into cognitive behavioral therapy. Since you said you're tired of apocalyptic doom scrolling, you'd probably do well with CBT, because it's main aim is at getting you to recognize the anxiety-inducing BS your brain likes to tell itself. Also helps to insulate you from the anxiety-inducing BS other people's brains want to tell your brain.  With that out of the way, let's start breaking things down. And what I'd suggest is looking more into things Trump has actually said (not through the filter of left-wing media/social media, but straight from the horse's mouth), and also then thinking about what the government can actually do. That means in terms of executive orders, and then legislation given a very tight Senate and like either a Democratic House or a very narrow Republican majority.  >IE: he will become a dictator  I assume this concern comes from the ""Dictator on day one"" comment. But go look at the comment. He wasn't saying ""Starting on day one I'll be a dictator for the next four years."" He said *just on day one.* And even then, he was talking only about executive action regarding drilling leases and border security. That's it, he was using colorful language to describe the types of executive action every single presidential candidate talks about doing on their first day of office. The Constitution is set up so that it's basically impossible to actually be a dictator, and Trump did even express an intent to try. So, let's scratch that off the list of things to be anxious about.  >particularly with implementing the controversial Project 25  So let's start by reminding ourselves that Project 2025 isn't Trump's agenda. He's said that parts of it are completely ridiculous and his criticism about it led to the director of Project 2025 resigning. Trump's daughter-in-law Lara has also been very critical of it. And she's not a nobody; she's the chair of the RNC.  So, there's very good reason to think the stuff in Project 2025 you find most troubling are also opposed by Trump. And even if he did support them, most of it requires getting through Congress which isn't really plausible.  >prosecuting political rivals  Recall that for all his talk about locking up Hillary Clinton, he made zero effort to do so. If you're thinking about his comments directed at election officials, go back to the actual words. He said he would go after any election officials who *cheated.* Do you think that prosecuting people actually involved in election fraud is outlandish or dangerous? Do you have similar thoughts about the case against Trump in Georgia? If Harris said her administration would prosecute anyone who illegally tried to suppress or intimidate voters, would you think that's a problem, or would you think that those are serious crimes that should be prosecuted?  >removing the board of education  I think you mean *Department* of Education. And doing that would have to go through Congress. Even with a Republican majority in the House and Senate, there wouldn't be votes for that. Any proposal that comes close to shutting it down would have to keep in place all the funding to states to stand a chance of getting passed, but the state funding is basically the whole enchilada. It'd be like shutting down the Post Office, but keeping the mail delivery.  >censoring the media  Recall that in his first term he routinely threatened the media, especially the New York Times, then made zero effort to do anything about it. That's because he has no power to do anything about it. Congress has no power to do anything about it. SCOTUS is extremely pro-free speech. And his threats this time around are basically just that they'll get more scrutiny. Worst case scenario, there's Congressional hearings where some executives get browbeat for a few hours and nothing happens after.  >mass deportation  This would of course be limited to people actually eligible to be deported (meaning illegal immigrants) and then further limited by the government's manpower. In 2016, Trump threatened mass deportation, but actually ended up deporting fewer people than Obama. Obama, criticized by the left as ""Deporter-in-Chief"" actually deported fewer than W. Bush, and W. Bush in turn deported fewer people than Clinton. Doesn't seem like much to be concerned about here. Probably more focus on stopping illegal immigrants from getting through in the first place, but mass deportations will probably be no worse than under Obama. How worried were you about it then?  >stripping LGBT rights  He has very little power here. The most important rights (gay marriage, anti-discrimination) are already enshrined in law. We got Obergefell then the Respect for Marriage Act, and Bostock. That's not going anywhere. What you might see at the margins is some stuff around trans women in sports and certain books getting removed from school libraries (but remaining otherwise easily available through the same channels most people get their books).  >having more power of the DoJ  There's not a ton Trump can really do here, even with some big shakeups, most of the DoJ's business will continue as usual. There could be some change in focus, but any effort to send the DoJ after his political opponents will probably be about as effective as Garland going after Trump. And remember that he talked about going after political opponents before and that just didn't happen. Hillary Clinton remains blissfully unindicted.  >using the military on protestors/civilians  This is largely constrained by state governors and the Posse Comitatus Act. Using the military on protesters would end up looking a lot like when Walz brought in troops to help with BLM riots.

Not that politics isn't serious, but I think you're lending these buzzwords too much credibility if they are causing you to experience daily anxiety attacks.

I don't think ""Project 2025"" is worth worrying about. Steve Bannon had an agenda very similar to Project 2025 for 2016. And you know what happened? The media started joking that Steve Bannon was the real president, and Trump fired him.  And you know what my takeaway from the January 6 riots was? It was that America was totally unprepared to deal with an insurrection and that taking over the government would have been surprisingly easy. But Trump didn't do it. He didn't plan, he didn't organize, he just invited a bunch of nobodies to Washington and said ""Give 'em a piece of your mind!""  So - a dictator? No. I don't think he's capable of it.

"Going to skip the stuff about the basics of the Electoral College that others have responded to and address this:  > The article basically says, in a nutshell, if an individual lives in a red state, for example, and if that individual votes Democrat, that individual's vote does not count. So for example, California is a democratic state, and if I voted for a Republican president, it would not count as the senators will vote democratic, and this is the electoral college, and this vote counts rather than the popular vote.  It all depends on what you mean by a vote ""counting.""  Often people will say a vote doesn't count if it's in a state where the outcome is a foregone conclusion, such as California or New York. There's a roughly 100% chance those states will go for Harris. Voting for Trump in California has no chance of helping Trump win the state, so folks will say it ""doesn't count."" Though at the same time, a vote for *Harris* in California also has no chance of changing the outcome, so by the same logic that vote wouldn't count either.  In pragmatic terms about affecting the outcome of the election, this makes sense, and so all the focus goes on the swing states which will ""decide"" the outcome of the election.  However, it's a rather simplistic (and I think a bit jaded) view. Without California, Harris has no chance of winning the election. So in that sense, California still matters a whole lot. It's just not as dramatic because we already know which way it's going to go.  I like to analogize this to a football game. Imagine it's the 4th quarter with 2 minutes left, the Tigers are on offense and trail the Hares 20-21. The Tigers just need to get into field goal range, get a successful field goal, and go up 23-21 as time expires to win the game. As they get set to make the kick, you'll like hear the announcers say something like ""it all comes down to this one play!""  But does that mean the other scoring drives ""don't count""? Of course not. Without the 20 points scored earlier in the game, that final field goal could not possibly make a difference. If the Tigers ended the game 3-21, they lose.  All the safe states matter, they're just not where the drama and uncertainty is.  >It sounds rather unfair, and so wondering why not switch to the popular vote?

"If you want to start exploring politics while you're still in school, you will want to attend a decent sized University. A small local college isn't going to have enough of a student body for there to be a varied political environment on campus. At a University you will have Democratic and Republican Party groups, as well as some 3rd party representation and groups focused on individual issues and demographics (black political groups, Latino, etc.). This kind of environment would give you a chance to explore the field and decide whether you have a real affinity for politics.   If you look at elected officials at the national level, you will notice a great many of them have Law degrees and attended Ivy League Universities. This has less to do with the education they got at those schools, then it does the people they were able to network with.

"Following the convention, Harris had a significant lead over Trump, topping out around 3.5% according to the 538 polling average. By the time of her Fox News interview, it had dropped to 2.4%, and then down to about 1.5% following the interview, finally falling to 1.2% going into the election.  It would seem that the more people got to know Harris, the less they liked her. And this runs contrary to the ""it was sexism"" narrative, where we would have expected to see a strong initial dislike of her which waned as people got to know her more.  I think one of the biggest problems for Harris is how she answered questions. And I'll highlight a few examples:  Fracking: She was asked on multiple occasions what her stance is. In 2019 she was fully in favor of banning in. But during her campaign she said she made her position clear in 2020 (referring to the VP debate). The problem is in the VP debate she said *Biden* opposed banning fracking, and the fact checkers called her out on that. Add in the ""my values haven't changed"" line, and folks end up thinking she still wants to ban it but refuses to say so.  Inflation and Anti-Gouging: One of her key policies she discussed for bringing down high prices of groceries and the like was a federal law against price gouging. Problem is price gouging laws only go into effect in declared emergencies, so they're irrelevant to the issue. Also, most of the country (including 5 of the 7 swing states) already has anti-gouging laws, so this wouldn't change anything for them, and folks are familiar with the fact that they're only about emergencies, not the present economy.  Differences From Biden: When asked what she would have done differently, she said she couldn't think of anything. Didn't even answer with bills she would have liked to have passed but couldn't with a Republican House.  Biden's Decline: Brett Baier asked her when she noticed Biden was having more pronounced problems and her answer was that Biden isn't running and Trump is bad. But the question is about her credibility and whether she has helped to hide Biden's problems from the public.  The overall impression I think a lot of voters got is that she's a typical slimy politician, but without the policy intellect of someone like Hillary, Obama, Sanders, Pelosi, etc. Not exactly someone who is going to inspire people.  Moving on:  >Why Hispanics voted Trump in masses?  Probably two things. The first is social conservatism, especially among Catholics. The second is the border. An important dynamic here is that most Hispanic American voters are of Mexican origin. But, Mexicans are no longer the majority of illegal immigrants. I'd wager that's made tough-on-the-border policies a lot more appealing to Mexican Americans.  Nationally, the high school drop out rate is 8.8%. For Hispanic Americans, it's 24.8%. For (only) a bachelor's degree it's 23.4% nationally, and 14.5% for Hispanic Americans. So guess who is hardest hit when it comes to competing with immigrants (legal and illegal) for jobs.  >What's your thoughts on people having to pretend to be Kamala Harris supporters for social acceptance, but voting Trump in secret?  Minnesota, Wisconsin, Nevada and (likely) Arizona all elected Democratic senators while also voting for Trump, so there was a lot of ticket splitting going on.  I don't think there was a lot of pretending to support Harris going on, and probably more just keeping quiet on the issue. But also my social circle is fairly open about who they support, including Trump supporters, so I don't have a great sense on this particular question.",bl1y,2024-11-11T09:04:24,3

"First of all, there is no issue of ""political freedoms"" here. Women are free to run and free to vote. In fact, women made up 53% of the vote this past election and typically are the majority of voters.  A major difference in the US is the size of the elections. You need a massive operation to win the general operation, as well as the primary before that. This means there's a big advantage for people who are in the establishment and built up connections. That takes a long time.  The longer pipeline, the longer the delay in demographic changes.  This is similar to what we see in other fields. Take something like the position of chief of a medical department at a hospital. How long after the end of segregation does it take to get a black chief? Well, you don't have black senior doctors to choose from yet, they have to be junior doctors first. Then before that they have to be in medical school, and then in college. So you've got decades to go after colleges being integrated before there's even the first person who is eligible for the job.  Look at the typical length of a president's political career before getting elected, then go back that far and ask how many women were in office on a track that would make running for President viable.",bl1y,2024-11-25T16:10:08,1

"Is the premise of your question that Libertarian voters flipped to Trump?  In 2020, they got 1.2%, and in 2024 only 0.4%, so if those other 0.8% went over to Trump, that could have been an important factor in such a close race.  But there's several things to consider here:  First, they may have gone over to Kennedy rather than Trump. Libertarian votes are often protest votes against the Democrat and Republican, rather than actual support for the Libertarian party. Kennedy was a viable protest vote option for people on the conservative side as many Libertarians are.  Second, they may have just stayed home rather than voting. That wouldn't help Trump win. The only thing it'd impact is whether Trump got over the 50% mark in the popular vote.  Third, and this is probably the most important one, 2020 and 2016 were outliers for the Libertarian Party. They traditionally get in the 0.5% range, not the 1.2% they got in 2020 or the 3% they got in 2016. I'd wager that 2016 had a particularly high number of protest votes.",bl1y,2024-11-25T20:26:00,2

The President has no power of reprisal, and the Congress can only impeach with a majority of the House and 2/3 of the Senate, which is a very high bar -- you won't get impeachment merely because political winds have blown the other way for a moment.  Judicial independence isn't about not having like-minded judges. *Any* process for choosing judges can result in whoever the decision maker is choosing like-minded judges.

So when I turned 18 my dad took me down to the DMV (the same place that issues DLs) and I got myself a 'Cal ID.'  It's basically a driver's license that doesn't allow you to drive.  Looks exactly the same and everything.  I could've skipped it!  Nobody made me do it.  Except for my dad.  ""You should have an ID now that you're 18"", he said.  I live in Italy now.  When our son was born, we had all of 2 weeks to get him down to the police station and get him an official national-level photo ID.  They *make* you do it.

The sheer speed of the dumbfuckery has a lot of people reeling. And there is so much going wrong, so quickly, it's hard for opposition to find a clear message and goal.  I'd also suggest that there's still snow on the ground in many parts of the US. If history is any predictor, mass protest will start to coalesce as the temperatures rise (both literally and figuratively).  It seems likely, even inevitable, we will come to an inflection point or flash point, that crystalizes opposition and creates enough backlash for people to take to the streets. When that point comes, how the Trump administration responds will be crucial. The last time their were protests in DC, Trump hid in his bunker and questioned whether protestors could be ""shot in the legs"". A wise leader would know they don't need to respond at all.

"Technically, many of the things trump is doing are being challenged in court. This is part of why he's doing so much, so fast. He wants to get things done before the courts challenge it (like sending a plane of immigrants off to El Salvador before the judge has fully given the order to stop), as well as have so many different objectionable actions that judges need to prioritize the most important ones and let the lower profile ones slide. He's also likely banking on the supreme Court deciding in his favor, considering there's a conservative majority, if things even get that far.  To answer your question of ""does the president have that much power?"" the honest answer is ""the president has as little power as they are willing to wield, and as much power as Congress and the supreme Court are willing to give."" Biden really didn't push his power all that much, and the times he did, he got pushback. Trump pushes his power all the time, so much more pushback would be needed for his power to appear equal to Biden's. We can quibble about what the constitution says the president's power is, but the reality is that they can do what they want until they can't.

"Here's a (hopefully simple) explanation. Person A in, idk, Germany makes a good. Person B in the United States wants to sell that good in the US, so they purchase it from Person A for $100. When the good arrives in the United States, it has to go through customs, which processes the package, checks that it's not dangerous, gets it into the hands of Person B. This typically has a processing fee, we'll say it's like $5. So, altogether, Person B has spent $105 dollars on the item, and they resell it to Person C for $125, making themselves a nice profit of $20.    Tariffs are an additional tax on things that are imported, usually a percentage of the value of what was imported. Let's use 10% as the example. So, when Person B picks up the item at customs, they pay $10 for the tariff (10% of $100), and $5 for the processing fee. They've now spent $115 to get the product. In order to make that same $20 they were making before, they now need to charge Person C $135 dollars. This is why people say consumers end up paying the cost of tariffs, because even though they didn't pay the tariff directly, it still gets reflected in the final cost of the product.   The idea is that people will instead buy the product from a company that makes it in the US, rather than buying it from the company making it in Germany, because in theory the price of the product made in the US hasn't gone up, making it a cheaper alternative. (This may not always be the case; if the price of a foreign good goes up $10, a US company could always go ""well, guess we'll go up by $5, still be cheaper, and make more money ourselves"")   The secondary idea is that if there isn't a lot of production for that product in the US, then companies will move their manufacturing facilities to the US in order to recapture the sales.   The reason Trump's original tariff policy was so disastrous is because it was global (in both the country sense and the type of products sense), abrupt, and VERY high. No one had a chance to move their production to the US before it was going to come into effect, so prices on just about everything were going to go up, all at once. If prices drastically increase on basically everything, people aren't going to have money for luxury goods, so a whole lot of markets would dry up, even for things that can/are made in the US. Not only that, but because Trump had previously set tariffs and then removed tariffs on Canada and Mexico, no one had any idea if these tariffs would actually stick, so even if they had lasted for longer than a week, no one really knew if it would actually be worthwhile to start moving production to the US. All together, it would have (and still might) result in a consumer base that doesn't have the money to buy anything but the necessities, if that, and a market that can't be sure if it should even bother trying to expand to bring prices back down when the tariffs could be removed at any moment. And, lastly, not everything can be made in the US, meaning there would be some products that go up in price, with no alternative whatsoever.   The small business aspect is mostly down to a exception that was made for packages under $800, which didn't require a processing fee and were exempt from tariffs. This meant that small businesses could afford to ship single products directly to people. Think of something like a small pottery business or something. Some guy in Germany hand makes pots, and sells them to people in the US. He's not mass producing anything and doesn't send large shipments, he sends 1 pot to 1 person at a time. The profit margins on an individual pot might be fairly high, but he can't crank them out at an incredible pace, so something like a higher tariff directly harms his profit margin without really any way to offset that. Larger businesses might be able to eat some losses, but small businesses don't have the ability to do that.",Jojofan6984760,2025-04-10T22:48:43,4
"I'll add on to /u/Jojofan6984760's comment.  Imagine you're opening a new business in the US, and you need a $1 million loan from a bank to get going. The bank is looking over your business plan, and it seems pretty good. You're going to be operating on thin margins (as many new businesses are), but it's a sound plan with good long term prospects.   However, a big part of your business is that you have to import foreign steel to make your factory and your products. While the bank is reviewing your business plan, Trump threatens a 25% tariff on imported steel. Suddenly your business model doesn't work. If you raised prices to offset the tariffs, too few people would buy your product, and the business just won't be profitable. Now the bank denies your loan.  Meanwhile another businessman is in the next cubicle also trying to get a loan from the bank. His business relies on imported raw materials as well, though there's no tariffs on what he's importing ...yet. The loan officer he's working with sees how all over the place Trump has been on tariffs and says it's too risky to make the loan even though there aren't tariffs at the moment. There might be tariffs tomorrow, no one knows. It's too risky, so the loan is denied, all because Trump *might* impose tariffs.  Businesses like stability. They want to know how much it'll cost to make their product, what they'll be able to sell it for, and how much money their consumers will have available to spend. Trump's volatility alone --even if every single tariff were dropped-- is enough to cause massive disruptions in the economy.",bl1y,2025-04-11T06:53:19,1
"I'm a middle aged man, I am 53. I am also a convicted felon.   I haven't heard any rhetoric from Trump or his administration about targeting ex-cons. That doesn't mean it is off the table, but they have not expressed any interest in doing so, to date.   The thing you want to pay attention to, is the current court battles around ICE detaining ""illegal"" residents. ICE is currently detaining people it claims came into the country illegally, without giving them due process. This means they have not been arrested, no charges have been filed against them, that they don't get a lawyer and don't go in front of a judge. This administration is claiming that people here illegally are not owed due process, and can be deported without due process.   In support of this argument is the fact that the Border Patrol has, for decades, detained people caught near the border, and without processing them, rounded them up and bussed them back across the border. This only happens with people who agree they have entered the US illegally, and will cooperate with being deported. If they don't, then they are taken into custody, formally arrested, and detained until they have a lawyer and a court date.   This creates a legal precedent that the Trump administration is trying to use for people detained anywhere in the country, rather than just immediately adjacent to the border. The concern with this is that if ICE can detain a person and deport them without due process, then ICE can detain ANYBODY and deport them. The whole ""due process"" thing would be the procedure where you have a lawyer and go in front of a judge, and that would be your chance to show you have a birth certificate, a passport, and other proofs of citizenship. Without that due process, you have no opportunity to establish your legal citizenship or legal residency.   Currently the courts are waffling on this issue and no definitive ruling has been made. Likely this issue will go to the Supreme Court, and there is no telling how they will rule these days. So stay calm for now, keep your eye on the headlines, and save your real concern for what may happen if the Supreme Court rules that illegal residents are not owed due process.   The Constitution does mandate due process for all persons within the borders of the United States. But it also mandates separation of church and state, as well as co-equal branches of government, with the Legislative branch determining how money is or is not spent. So... we'll see about that.   **TL/DR**: If the Supreme Court rules that illegal residents are not owed due process before being deported, get worried, get your passport and start carrying it at all times, or just get gone from this country.",BluesSuedeClues,2025-04-11T10:07:35,2

"Youth voter turnout has in fact been on the rise.  It declined in the late 70s, went up a bit, then declined again in the late 90s. That followed Nixon's resignation and the Clinton impeachment, and followed general downward trends among most demographics as people became disillusioned with politics.  In climbed in 2004 and 2008, probably from opposition to the Iraq War, and then enthusiasm for Obama. Then fell off a bit in 2012, but climbed in 2016 and 2020. (I don't believe there's data yet for 2024.)  Looking back to 1964, 2020 was roughly on par with the highest of those years, though it's worth noting that because of Covid, every demographic voted at high rates. 2024 had the second best turnout rate though, so it's likely the youth vote remained relatively high.  All that said, the youth rate is still the lowest compared to other ages. So what could be done?  Probably lowering the voting age to 16. People's lives tend to be more stable at 16 than 18, due to all the disruption from moving out, going off to college, getting a job, and so on. It's probably easier to start the habit of voting at 16 than later in life, and people who vote once are more likely to vote again.  Another issue though is likely that young people move a lot. 20-30% of college students moved out of state, and of the people who stayed in state, a huge portion will have moved to a different city. And then, many people move either to a new city or even a new state after graduating and getting their first job, or to attend grad school.  People who have recently moved are less inclined to vote. Most states (43 out of 50 this last election) aren't battlegrounds, so there's little incentive to vote in the presidential election. And if you're new to an area, there's less motivation to vote in the local races. Even less motivation to do so if you're planning to move again in a year or two. If it's fall of your junior year of college and you're hoping to move after you graduate, how much do you care about voting for mayor or governor?",bl1y,2025-04-23T08:18:39,3

"\*dissent  One of the essential elements of fascism is to simultaneously view their movement as under attack, in an existential war against an opponent bent on destroying them, while also insisting that opponent is weak, impure, ""poisoning the blood"" of the people, and decadent, even effeminate. The people who accept these narratives, don't seem bothered by the obvious contradiction in desperately struggling to survive against an inferior enemy.   So when opposing voices reply in r/Conservative, they don't see it as disagreement, they view it as an attack. And because they don't see their opposition as people with any value, they man the barricades and lock you out. For them, it's not a discussion, it's a war.   The goal and result of these narratives is to produce a movement of people who are primed to accept violence as a necessity and view their opposition as subhuman.   I don't bother to post in r/Conservative because I would quickly get banned. But I do occasionally go there to lurk and see what they're saying to each other, how they view events. Yesterday was a fascinating day. After the news broke that President Trump had referred to President Zelensky as a ""dictator"" and insisted Ukraine started the war with Russia, the sub was at war with itself. One side will not tolerate any criticism of Donald Trump and the other side was upset that he had openly lied about something so important, and was parroting Russian propaganda. Half the new posts were complaints that their safe space was being ""brigaded"".

"> If the Democrats refuse to remove Joe Biden, would it not follow that a second Trump term isn't the existential crisis we're being sold?  Not necessarily. It mostly means that people are overestimating how simple or effective it would be to replace Biden with another candidate.  Because these are your other options:  1) Biden steps down, lets Harris take over. Harris already polls worse against Trump than Biden does. And this is still while she's largely untested--her numbers could go down further over a presidential campaign. So that's not a better option.  2) Biden steps down and chooses someone other than Harris to replace him. This would ignite an absolute firestorm within the party over bypassing Harris and taking black and/or female voters for granted. These demographics are your fiercest organizers, donators and door-knockers, and you'd be alienating them at the exact time you need them most. In addition to that, a lot of the candidates people are suggesting as replacements are either divisive (Newsom, Buttigieg) or unknown and untested (Whitmer, Beshear), and thus don't poll any better against Trump than Biden does. We're only a few months out from the election, and that doesn't give either camp much time to get their numbers up. So this is a very high risk option that could permanently damage the Democrats' relationship with some of their core demographics, without necessarily helping them in the presidency. And it could hurt them not just in terms of the presidency, but with every race up and down the ballot.  3) They wait until the convention and have some kind of brokered convention scenario. As the other poster pointed out, this isn't a realistic option unless Biden cooperates because first-round delegates are all required to vote for him. (And if Biden was cooperating, he'd choose his own replacement as in option 1/2, not this.) It's also not a realistic option because these days, the convention is a formality and is often held after state ballot access deadlines have passed. And it would be insanely divisive among voters supporting various candidates, with minimal time left for them to defuse, get over it, and reconcile. There's a reason we usually do this intra-party fighting during a primary now, almost a year out from the election, and not a couple months before it. A couple months after the fighting, people are still pissed!  Also, many of the same problems from option 2 (divisive or untested candidates) still remain in this scenario. And both scenarios 2 and 3 (and to some extent 1) introduce the problem that Democrats are running on a platform of ""protecting the democratic process"" while circumventing it, running a candidate who voters didn't vote for in their own primary. It's heavily undercutting their own message.  Biden is a very flawed candidate.

"I assume you're asking in the context of US law.  No.  So the place to start here is with the cause of death. That would be cancer, heart attack, whatever is actually killing the person. Obviously that's not the health insurance company.  So what you'd have to try to argue is that the health insurance company had a duty of care which create liability for inaction. For these types of cases where the duty arises from a contractual relationship, the argument would have to be that the victim wouldn't have been in the situation that led to their death if the contractual relationship didn't exist.  For instance, if a life guard fails to go rescue someone who is drowning, presumably that person wouldn't have gone swimming without the life guard on duty. Drawing from a real case here, a coal miner wouldn't go into the coal mine if they knew the pit boss wasn't going to turn on the exhaust fans.  You can't really argue ""I wouldn't have gotten cancer if I knew my health insurance claim would be denied!""  The best argument that could be made is that they would have gone with a different insurer who wouldn't have denied the claim. And that's an okay argument, though it's also going to be a bit of a novel theory as far as I know.  That's not the end of the analysis though.  We also have to ask what precisely was the contractual agreement. To go back to the lifeguard analogy, imagine a sign on the lifeguard stand says ""This beach is patrolled in the area between the two green markers."" If someone swims *outside* that area, there's no longer a duty to rescue them if they start drowning.  Likewise, with insurance, your agreement is not just a one line ""We'll cover everything."" You know when you get your insurance that not everything is covered and the insurance company has the ability to deny claims.  So what we'd have to do from there is show that the claim was denied in breach of the agreement. And since that's getting into the fine details of the agreement, the answer here is just going to have to stop at ""it depends.""  It's a shaky legal theory and relies on a lot of the specific agreement between the parties. But now to answer the question as you actually phrased it:  >For example, if you recognize that a person's healthcare‚Äîbe it immediate treatment or long-term care‚Äîis essential for their survival, then choosing to cut off that care or deny access is effectively committing murder, including mass murder and premeditated murder.  The way you've written it, this would include someone going to a chemo therapy center with no insurance, not a dime in their pocket, and just being turned away. The doctors have chosen to deny access, knowing that the person's health depended on getting that care.  The cancer clinic has not committed murder as there was no duty to protect the random person who wasn't a patient.",bl1y,2024-12-11T16:36:32,1
"Under American law, no. Most people don‚Äôt have a duty to rescue another person unless they were the catalyst of the danger to their life, or unless there was such a circumstance where the person didn‚Äôt attempt to save themself or were in greater danger because they were assured they would be rescued. Also, killing somebody else is not necessarily ‚Äúmurder.‚Äù If you are acting in self-defense, for example, you could intend to kill somebody else but the aggressor is usually held responsible.  I‚Äôm gonna make an educated guess that this question was inspired by the United CEO assassination. There‚Äôs not really much question that the healthcare insurance industry is largely, or at least in part, built on a callous disregard for human life and wellbeing. Like most other types of insurance, their business model is to spend as little as they can get away with, but one of the key differences is that it is much harder to keep them in check (for example, if you ever have a property insurance claim, you *absolutely* want to consider hiring a public adjuster. That is not an opportunity here). However, to call it murder implies that most people would be safer and better off without their healthcare plans. Paying for treatment exclusively out of pocket is usually much more dangerous. Medical insurance is extremely deceptive and as unhelpful as it can get away with, but not murder. However, there is tons of room for reform, and it is a failure of the U.S. government that they don‚Äôt have more responsibility to their policyholders.",AgentQwas,2024-12-11T17:06:37,1
"""Murder"" is a legal term with a legal definition.  If the law says something is not murder, then it's not murder.  Being morally responsible for someone's death is a different thing, and much harder to define.  One could argue that a health insurance company denying healthcare makes them morally responsible for that person's death.  But that also kinda implies that any time anyone puts their own financial wellbeing over another's health also makes them morally culpable for that death.

Throwing out or donating all the old clothes I don't wear anymore, bought a nice painting from a local artist. I'm going to make the room my sanctuary, my ""safe space"". No screens, just books. I bought a dual use air purifier/ humidifier. Hoping that helps with my allergies.   I'll still do my best to advocate for sanity, to resist the growing tyranny of the oligarchy. But in the end, all I can really do is take care of myself and the people I care about, to the best of my ability.   ...and of course, I drink. :/",BluesSuedeClues,2024-12-31T11:26:36,2

"This is entirely anecdotal, but my sense is the opposition to Donald Trump and everything he is doing, are waiting. They're demoralized, frustrated and probably a lot are apathetic. America chose this. America voted for this travesty. Maybe the Democrats are waiting for public sentiment to shift against Trump? Maybe they're waiting to see how effective the courts are in curbing his actions? Or maybe they're waiting for a watershed moment, something so horrible it motivates a massive response from the citizens?  If it's the last one, we're probably finished as a democracy, because Jan.6 should have been that moment. Jan.6 should have united Americans the way Sept.7 did, or Pearl Harbor.

"Being women was certainly a factor in both Harris' and Clinton's election losses. Was it the deciding factor? There's no strong evidence of that, or defining evidence of any other single issue being the decisive point the elections were decided on. This is why you see so much acrimony and argument among the political pundits following those elections. They're all certain they know what caused Harris or Clinton to lose, but there is no real consensus.   In 2016, Clinton received about 3 million more votes than Donald Trump, so it's hard to say how her sex may have affected that election.    The 2024 election results were extremely close, with Trump getting only about 1.5% more votes than Harris received. All things being equal, would a man have won that race? There's really no way to know. If Harris had been a white woman, would that have been enough of a difference to win the race? Still no way to measure that objectively.   It's useful to remember that the American experiment was started by a religious group looking for the freedom to practice their beliefs as they chose. Americans are taught to venerate these ""Puritans"" from a very young age, in our school systems. The often ignored historical reality, is that these immigrants came to North America because their religious practices were so oppressive and vicious, they were no longer welcome in Europe.

"This is a really great question to ask and it's beyond the scope of a casual question with a casual answer. This is a deep question about the heart of the myth of the founding fathers.   Washington wasn't a political theorist and wasn't responsible for America's political system.

(Editing bc I dropped my phone and sent the comment prematurely)  Adams and Morris believe in something called natural aristocracy. Which is exactly as it sounds. Fast forwarding to your question, parties were seen as contrary to the execution of natural aristocracy. So it's reasonable to think the alternative to political parties was just elections/appointments of the natural aristocrats.   You might want to know what the other non-party options were and Adams was aware of many. He rejects them thoroughly in many of writings, particularly his 3 part defense of the constitution.

In 1963, JFK drafted an Executive Order to withdraw all American troops from Vietnam. He did not publish it because it would make him look soft on communism before the election. When LBJ returned from Dallas as POTUS, he asked the JCS what it would take to win in Vietnam. The answer came back"" 1. A declaration of War against North Vietnam. 2. Full mobilization of the Guard and Reserve. 3. Unrestricted bombing and mining of the harbors of the North. 4. 500,000 troops on the ground inside Vietnam. According to Scotty Ropstow who was in the room when it happened, LBJs response was ""boys if I take that to the Hill, Sam Rayburn is gonna hand me my Great Society and tell me 'You hang on to this Lyndon, we got a war to fight', and that's not going to happen. Get me some better numbers."" The JCS came back with and increase in military advisors to 50,000 and additional naval air strikes in support of ARVN. That's what LBJ asked for, and then his minions harassed the sonar operator from the Turner Joy to say he was certain he heard torpedo's in the water, Congress passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution and down the rabbit hole we went.  The redistribution of income and wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 10% happened because Reagan eliminated the top brackets from the tax code and removed protections for Unions. From 1936 until 1965, the TMR was 91% so the ones dividing profits would only receive 9 cents of every dollar they gave themselves. LBJ cut that to 70% to win support for his War and in 1981 Reagan cut it to 50% and in 1985 to 28%. From 1936 to 1980, workers received pay raises that were 94% of their increased productivity and the bottom 90% saw income and wealth steadily increase faster than that of the top 10%.. Globalization didn't help, but moving jobs to cheaper labor had been a feature of the American economy forever. Likewise automation has been here since the Jacquard Loom. From 1981 to 2021 worker productivity nearly doubled while worker real income increased about 12% while executive compensation went up over 300%. The change in the tax code is the ONLY rational explanation of the change in income distribution - after Reagan's cuts, the boss's could keep the money they gave himself, so that's what they did.",Olderscout77,2024-05-03T07:12:43,1

"As someone from AZ and involved in Dem. politics there for the entirety of my adult life before moving last year:  > Would it be correct to guess many more republicans favored repeal but voted against doing so because they feared retribution, so they had a few safe members vote in favor and the rest were able to conscience voting no because they knew it would pass with or without them?  Absolutely not. If anything, I'd be very comfortable betting most of the 5 Republican legislators that did vote for repeal would vote yes on the 1864 ban were it introduced as a ballot referendum (or at least one with nominal rape/incest/health of the mother exceptions), and that those that did vote in favor of repeal did so because they represent competitive (or in Shope's case, kinda-competitive) districts.  In the last two years of the Ducey administration, two bills were signed into law that demonstrate partisan breakdowns on abortion in AZ. Those were [SB1457](https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/55leg/1R/bills/SB1457P.pdf) (2021) and [SB1164](https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/55leg/2R/bills/SB1164P.pdf) (2022). SB1457 - alongside a ban on all abortions for genetic abnormality-related issues - included a fetal personhood clause that anti-abortion activists in states across the nation (and in DC) have been leaning on to try and dismantle existing abortion laws whole-cloth:  > THE LAWS OF THIS STATE SHALL BE INTERPRETED AND CONSTRUED TO ACKNOWLEDGE, ON BEHALF OF AN UNBORN CHILD AT EVERY STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT, ALL RIGHTS, PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES AVAILABLE TO OTHER PERSONS, CITIZENS AND RESIDENTS OF THIS STATE, SUBJECT ONLY TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE  UNITED STATES AND DECISIONAL INTERPRETATIONS THEREOF BY THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT.   SB1164 - the bill that nominally created a 15-week abortion ban, also had a passage in it that said ""We don't want this bill to seem like we're legalizing abortions before the 15-week point, and we definitely don't want to repeal the 1864 ban"", a line the state supreme court relied on when deeming it to be the law in AZ last month:  > This act does not:  > 1. Create or recognize a right to abortion or alter generally accepted medical standards. The Legislature does not intend this act to make lawful an abortion that is currently unlawful.  > 2. Repeal, by implication or otherwise, section 13-3603, Arizona Revised Statutes, or any other applicable state law regulating or restricting abortion.   Both of these bills passed on party lines, including 2 Yes votes each from then-Rep. Shawnna Bolick (now a State Senator who voted in favor of repeal after her husband sided with the state supreme court's majority in making it active law), Rep. Tim Dunn ([on record saying he backed repeal to take the wind out of the sails of the ballot referendum enshrining it in the state constitution](https://twitter.com/TimDunn_AZ/status/1783257432678101025)), Sen.

Bliss, Carbone, Gillette, Gress, Heap, Hendrix, Jones, Kolodin, Livingston, Marshall, McGarr, Montenegro, Barbara Parker, Pe√±a, Smith, and Willoughby. On the Senate side that list consists of: Sens. Bennett, Carroll, Kerr, Shamp, and Wadsack. Of those, Gress was the only one to vote in favor of repeal this past month.

Kevin Cramer](https://www.cramer.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-cramer-rep-johnson-introduce-bicameral-legislation-to-allow-pregnant-mothers-to-receive-child-support) talking about how a bill he helped introduce at the national level akin to Gress's was explicitly about making sure laws reflected that idea that life begins at conception:  > Life begins at conception, and this bill is a straightforward first step towards updating our federal laws to reflect that fact.    Gress was open about how he had sought help from the deeply socially conservative think-tank called the Center for Arizona Policy, though he denied that the intent of the bills was to strengthen the legal standing for fetal personhood. While 3 of Gress's bills were held in committee, both HB2427 and HB2502 were voted on by both chambers and passed on party lines.

This gives an unfair advantage to the candidate who is popular in the small states, and sometimes the advantage is enough for the guy who lost the popular vote to win the election.",[deleted],2024-05-10T00:05:08,3

"From my understanding, third way socialism is compassionate conservatism, which advocates for freedom in both social policy and economic policy, but its right leaning followers still want people to ‚Äúcome around‚Äù and reconcile with conservative social values. When it comes to welfare it advocates for a specific and moderate type of welfare that tries to appeal to both the center left and the center right, like free college tuition and healthcare. The right gets on board with it because they can more directly see the good in it. They feel this type of welfare benefits everyone and is necessary and not wasteful. One nation conservatism is something else. All of its followers believe in conservative social values and economic values. As for welfare it believes that‚Äôs the job of the private sector, not the government. The ideology acknowledges that there are problems in the country but says the reason for them is that the private sector has somehow lost its way and is greedy and isn‚Äôt like how it‚Äôs supposed to be. They say in a true economic paradise the big businesses have ‚Äúcompassionate conservative‚Äù social values where they take care of the people so everyone can prosper.

Is he friendlier with Putin than is comfortable for a lot of people? Yes. Is he taking orders from the Kremlin? No. Not only has there been no evidence of that, can you imagine Trump taking orders from *anyone*?  I think the most damning thing to this whole hypothesis is that the Trump administration actually sent lethal military aid to Ukraine. Everyone remembers him trying to get a political kickback from Ukraine, and then forgets the context of us actually sending weapons to Ukraine in the first place, including the all-important anti-tank missiles that helped to stall Russia's advances in the first days of the war.  And for further context, the Obama administration's policy was to send only non-lethal aid. A bit more than the ""just blankets"" Trump has portrayed it as, but even following the invasion of Crimea, Obama didn't start sending them weapons. And this followed four years of the Obama administration trying to build a stronger relationship with Russia, including cancelling plans for a missile defense shield in Europe.  You could just as easily argue the Obama or Clinton were Russian assets. And to be perfectly clear, you'd also be just as wrong.  >Can anyone tell me what‚Äôs likely happening behind the scenes, or what‚Äôs already happened?

It doesn't really mean much on paper that they're the same or separate.  Practically speaking though, the biggest thing it affects is how people choose who to vote for in presidential elections. We vote not just for who should be at the top when it comes to running the government, but also who should be the public face of the government. That means we'll take into consideration things like if a person is articulate and charismatic and ""looks presidential.""

"COVID economic depression, Floyd Riots, Mask Mandates, etc. - Trump was at the helm for a lot of bad things, but now what we're looking at is essentially a referendum on whether the last 4 years of economic growth were based on his efforts, or Biden's.  Trump saw \~55.7% growth between Jan 2017 and Jan 2021 despite the COVID economic collapse (which had recovered by the time Trump left office). Joe Biden has seen only 32.4% growth in that same period, having fought off inflation and significantly increased real wages.  The problem is that while Biden has increased real wages, practically speaking those real wages are not helping him. The poor were already going to vote for him, but their competition with the middle class for their tier of goods is driving them crazy. Housing is just one of many examples where poor Americans are competing with the middle class, resulting in higher prices for those goods.

No matter who it is. That is why we've all seen for years many people showing their frustrations with their options: ""really? These are our two options?"", etc.  Voting in your party's candidate can create long-term benefits to your belief in values that last a lot longer than the candidate's term. An example of this is that Trump was able to significantly sway the power of the SCOTUS to be conservative for many, many years to come even after his term(s) as president.  But because of the two-party system, you get stuck with the option that the party props up. Even if that individual is not someone you prefer - but because they're the ticket to \*your\* party getting power, most people are going to stick with that candidate.  Trump has managed to create a base of voters that are very loyal to him specifically - which has given him great power in the Republican party. He has ""Obama""-type influence on the Republican party.  I could go on, but at the end of the day, it really is the two-party system that is offering voters only two viable choices. Most people are going to stick with the side that offers them the path to having their values represented. And due to the power of both parties, many voters feel (and there is truth to it), that if they vote for an independent that may actually align with their individual beliefs more, they're actually wasting their vote on a non-viable option which could lead to the candidate they don't want to have an advantage.

"They're all different.   Old Republican policy was always to cut taxes and regulation and allow the free market to work. This sometimes worked, as it allows for companies to expand rapidly, and it quickly increases the amount of money people have which they can spend. There are downsides to this. It usually creates greater amounts of economic inequality and helps bolster monopolies through the destruction of anti-trust regulation, like what Reagan did. For some examples, look at Trumps tax cuts in 2017(I think this was when they passed)  Democrats, on the other hand, prefer to focus on large, long term investments and incentives. Things like the infrastructure bill and chips act. These, of course, create tons of jobs(look at the new fabs and rail jobs) and help build up American infrastructure over the long term, especially in urban areas. The downside here is almost always the increase in spending, and subsequent increase in taxes, which every American hates. They also generally support higher regulation to protect people and the environment, along with stronger social programs.  Both the economic systems have their pluses and minuses, but the real difference is long term vs short term. Short term, tax cuts will always make Americans happier and boost the economy, as you're essentially instantly giving Americans a big stimulus cheque. Sounds great, right? Well, long term, Democrat policies usually prevail. Spending on infrastructure, social programs, and long term investments, by every single economic indicator, has significant economic benefit. Take the Chips act. Yes, Biden could've just cut 280B or so from people's taxes, and immediately made many Americans happy, but over the next 10 years that Chips act is gonna create thousands of high paying jobs, and usually whenever a high impact industry like tech and chips comes around, it creates whole ecosystems to support these companies and people, which in term further boosts the economy(Look at Detroit in the early days of cars, or the Bay Area for tech, or LA for Media). The biggest reason why we don't just do this investment all the time is, well, those tax increases would be really unpopular, and we do also need some short term growth. You can kinda think of it in sports terms. It'd be like trading your pick this year for 2 picks 5 years out. Yes, 2 picks is worth more, but your team will be worse now, and we can't be 100% sure what those picks will turn out to be.  As for Trump, well, it's not like the other 2. Yeah, he has a lot of the same principles as the other republicans, with lower taxes and regulatory cuts, but there is also the tariffs, which have basically been universally lambasted by economists. The down stream effects of tariffs are, simply put, terrible. Tariffs help a lot of raw material companies, like steel mills, along with simple goods manufacturing, like clothing. It, however, really hurts any company with more complex goods, like chips, tech, cars, and tons of other non-raw good companies. Basically, these companies, to manufacture at a good cost, need to import raw goods to survive and manufacture, which becomes near impossible to do so with high tariffs. Here's a list of companies hurt by this:   [https://www.cato.org/commentary/here-are-202-companies-hurt-trumps-tariffs](https://www.cato.org/commentary/here-are-202-companies-hurt-trumps-tariffs)   Companies need open trade for goods to manufacture, and every point of evidence we have says that tariffs end up as a tax on consumers and domestic complex goods manufacturers, which just so happen to be our largest sector of manufacturing. During his last term, Trump lost tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs before covid even started. Meanwhile, the investment Biden has done over the last 4 years has led to a massive boom in manufacturing jobs. This will likely continue to grow more and more as new plants open. Going back to the sports terms, well, it'd be like trading the 1st overall pick for a late 2nd and some old guy you can slot in for a few minutes.   Basically, old Republican and Democrat policies both have upsides and downsides, and both should have their place in an economy, while Trumps policies are flat out dumb.",ChampionshipLumpy659,2024-07-31T12:38:45,2

I think the people who will genuinely be upset about the VP pick are mostly confined to people who spend way more time paying attention to and discussing politics than the average person (so the type of people like us who comment on this subreddit lol). The average person probably does not feel strongly one way or another about who is picked out of Kelly/Shapiro/Beshear/Walz.

"I figure I should say this, but yes, the VP pick does absolutely matter. Without LBJ on the ticket, Kennedy probably doesn't win Texas. Meanwhile, in 2008, Sarah Palin proved exceptionally unpopular, and when compared with the(at the time) very popular Joe Biden, it made the ticket look way worse.  The main 2 that seem to be getting the nod is Mark Kelly and Josh Shapiro. Both have downsides and upsides. The main benefit to Kelly is that he's very popular and can help secure the southwest when that region is increasingly becoming the battleground for elections. He's been in 2 races so far, and in those races he's far outperformed the other democrat on the ticket. He's very well liked and regarded, and him on the ticket would really help in Arizona.   Shapiro, on the other hand, has risen to prominence after he fixed that freeway that collapsed in like a week. He's proven to be a guy that gets stuff done, which has made him exceedingly popular in Pennsylvania, even amongst Republicans. He does have strong Pro-Israel views, and he's much more moderate than other Democrats, but he's also done a lot of bipartisan work, and having 2 people with some policy disagreement might be good for the White House, as they compare and contrast each other.  Now, who would I pick? Shapiro. Pennsylvania is probably the most important state in this election season, and picking Shapiro would definitely boost any chances of winning in the state. However, if Kelly gets the nod I wouldn't be shocked or unhappy. He's very well liked nationally, as he's a vet, a former astronaut(look up the video of him with the gorilla suit in the ISS), and he's become nationally acclaimed for his gun control stance after his wife, a then congresswoman, was shot(she's alive, but not nearly fully recovered).

Stock market performance, 13 keys(Which I know a lot of people hate, but they're worth at least a glance), issue polling(people are much more flip floppy on general polling than issue polling), fundraising and volunteer numbers, voter registration numbers leading up to the election, and overall enthusiasm.

And there's McGovern's 37.5% against Nixon.  The most realistic scenario is a credible third party takes enough votes to pull one party below the 40% number. I think you could potentially have that happen if one party is already polling so low that voters aren't actually concerned with splitting the vote because they're already lost.

"I looked at the speakers from last night (not including those listed as performers, or the closing benediction), and here's the breakdown, with percent representation that night versus their representation in the general population:  White: 23 (46% < 58%)  Black: 13 (26% > 12%)  Hispanic: 8 (16% < 19%)  Asian: 6 (12% > 6%)  Far from there being little to no representation for Hispanics at the DNC, they actually got the closest to being proportionately represented.  When we look at the prime spots, the numbers change quite a bit. If we look at the last 13 people to go (starting with Hakeem Jeffries), there's 9 White, 3 Black, 1 Hispanic. For Hispanic speakers to get proportional representation here, there should have been 3.  So now to get to your question, why is that?  For starters, one of them was Walz, and 3 of the speakers were relatives of Harris (2 in-laws, 1 niece).  Three of the speakers are also the party elite, Bill Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, and Hakeem Jeffries. Then we also have Pete Buttigieg and Josh Shapiro. Maybe we count Amy Klobuchar as part of the party elite.  So that accounts for 9-10 of the 13 top slots, with 1 of the remaining going to a Hispanic senator from Nevada.  It seems like the answer is the Hispanics were well represented to the DNC, and to the extent they weren't well represented in the prime slots the answer is because neither Harris nor Walz are Hispanic, and it usually takes a long time to get into the party leadership so their lack of representation among the party elites reflects past lack of representation.  That leaves us with one big question though which is why *now* Hispanics are under represented among Democrats. For instance, despite the Hispanic population being 50% larger than the Black population, there are 6 more Black members of Congress than Hispanic. With all the hype around Harris's race, I can't recall any serious conversation about her having a Hispanic VP. It certainly seems that the Democrats are far more focused on giving more representation to Blacks with Hispanics largely being forgotten, despite their much larger numbers.  I think a lot of that has to do with the pipeline. The Black population in the US goes back hundreds of years, while the Hispanic population is fairly new.

"I find it hard to describe even *what* the campaigns are doing.  Trump is all over the place when he talks and doesn't seem to be good at either delegating campaign strategy to someone who knows what they're doing or to take advice. The RNC went fairly well until Trump's strange speech that went on for 90 minutes and just got progressively worse. I think going before the group of black journalists was a really good idea, and Trump was just not close to prepared for it and had lots of unforced errors and missed opportunities. His attacks against Harris have been quixotic and missed much easier things, like pointing to her support for single-payer healthcare during her 2016 primary run (*universal* healthcare polls well, getting rid of people's current private insurance does not, even among Democrats).  With Harris, the strategy seems to be mostly to run against Project 2025, but they're doing it in a way where all the fact checkers continuously point out that it's being misrepresented. She's not doing well in terms of laying out her own vision. Her campaign site doesn't have a platform yet and she hasn't done any interviews with the press. She's said she will do one by the end of the month, but that was on the 9th, it's now the 27th, and an interview hasn't been scheduled yet (or at least not announced). Some of that is understandable because it takes time to convert from being Biden's running mate to being top of the ticket, but her team must have known this was a very real possibility weeks before Biden dropped out. It's starting to feel like her platform is ""you'll have to elect me to see what's in it.""",bl1y,2024-08-27T10:30:24,0
"Neoliberalism isn't necessarily small government. It's just laissez-faire directed on economics. It's certainly able to be a big government when it comes to protections and interference into people's lives, military spending, and so forth. The further ways you describe neoliberalism are correct.   It's more about market forces for the goal of overall economic fitness. It isn't entirely exclusionary of social welfare. It's more exclusionary of antitrust, and regulation that *seems* only about business. It leaves room open for protections of the people, unlike laissez faire stance, such as environmental and the absolute understanding that a healthy free market economy *does* have a poor class that is likely too poor to self sustain. That's why things like family credit and a low tier tax bracket that can effective become zero percent is under the purview of neoliberalism.  It's in the direction of laissez faire with respect to most countries, it's not absolutely laissez faire.  With that in mind, I opened up the sub and saw a lot of democratic propaganda. I would suggest democrats very adaquetly fit the bill for neoliberalism.

"Because Trump is far more popular than any other Republican within his party's voting base. Which is not surprising if you understand the modern GOP;  Short answer is that the establishment GOP fucked over their voters for decades and so now their own voters don't trust them and have rolled the dice with Trump.  Longer answer:  Since Reagan took over the party ~45 years ago the Republicans domestic policy has only one goal:  To put more wealth and power into the hands of those who are already wealthy and powerful. They are the masters the GOP actually serves.  They primarily serve them through tax cuts and destroying government regulation (including making bribery legal).  The problem is that platform only benefits a very small percentage of the population so they need to convince people who are not helped (and may actually be harmed) by their policies to vote for them. That's why they have an informal coalition with the single issue voters (anti-abortion & gun worshippers) and the broader conservative culture warriors.  However if there is a conflict between the desires of their true masters and the culture warriors the GOP will always serve the needs of their masters. For abortion and guns that's not a problem because the wealthy and powerful will always have access to safe abortions regardless of the law and they are very rarely victims of gun violence.  With regards to the broader culture warriors there's largely no conflict because the wealthy have always been able to ignore any conservative cultural norms. However there is one major issue in which there is a conflict: Immigration.  For the conservative cultural warriors their primary need is that America remains a strongly White majority country with traditionally European-Christian values. Since, post-WW2, less than 10% of all immigration has been White, immigration directly attacks their core needs.  However immigration helps grow the economy and provides cheap labor so the wealthy and powerful are pro-immigration because it makes them richer.  So from the 1980's through ~2010 the GOP never did anything about immigration because that's what their masters wanted. However they did demogogue about it a lot on talk radio and Fox so they gave their voters the impression they were on their side while they did nothing.  In the 80's and 90's they were successful because non-White immigrants were largely confined to their traditional areas (major cities on the coasts,  Texas and the Southwest, southern Florida) however as they became a larger part of the population they started showing up in smaller towns / cities that had previously had no minorities and so now the issue was in the voters faces.  Then in 2008 a Black man with a Muslim sounding name got elected president and the culture war crowd realized they really had lost control of the country. They recognized that the GOP establishment was not working for them and so they used the primaries to take out GOP establishment politicians even if it meant their culture warrior candidate would lose in the general election. So they broke free of the threat that they needed to vote for GOP establishment or the bad guys would win.  After doing that a few times the GOP establishment got scared and fell in line behind the voters. However the culture war crowd had slept on the issue for too long and by the time they acted it was too late to change the fact that Whites will become a minority in the USA within the next 10-15 years.  The only way to avert that is to take really extreme actions like halting all non-White immigration and deporting tens of millions of immigrants. However doing so would harm the economy and likely crash the stock market and so no GOP politician will actually do it.  So they need someone who is crazy enough to do the things they want. Although it's unlikely he would actually do so (because of the money) their best chance at that person is Trump so they are ride or die with him.",A_Coup_d_etat,2024-09-27T08:56:28,2

If you take a different approach, a more human approach to how or why she stumbled on that question, it might be because she probably thinks, ""No""  But not because she isn't worthy of the position. I would think it comes from a position of respect for Joe Biden.

No. Winning just a tiny number of Trump voters over could decide the election, as could just dispelling some fears about her such that it'd get some Trump voters to stay home instead.  There's a second question about her performance. In hindsight, seeing how she performed in the interview, was it a mistake?  Yes. I doubt it won anyone over, probably made some people who were inclined to not vote more likely to vote, and maybe actually deflated a bit of her support (though I doubt many people leaning towards her watched it). I'd say that every single answer was a train wreck, except I'm not sure she actually answered a single question. The entire second half was just ""But Trump!""

While we're on the topic of endorsements, a place where they play a much bigger role is early on in primaries. You'll often start with people who are relatively unknown to the voters.

"> Why are the Pew and CNN 2020 exit polls so different  The Pew poll you're looking at isn't an exit poll. The CNN poll is. They used very different methodologies.  Exit polling is when they sit outside of polling locations and try to get people who just voted to fill out questionnaires. It's prone to a lot of error due to sampling issues and non-response bias. It's not extremely accurate and not really meant to be. The main purpose is to provide media companies with enough data to be able to call the winner of states during their election night coverage. On top of that, the pandemic messed up the usual exit polling methodology because so many more people didn't vote in person or voted early. The exit pollsters tried to account for this by doing exit polling at early voting locations and adding in some telephone polling to supplement, but it probably still threw off the results a lot.  The Pew poll was conducted entirely through their normal polling methodology of getting people to fill out surveys online or over the phone after the election, and they used voter data from the states to verify that the people they were talking to actually voted in the election.

"The issue with these terms is that there's a lot of different definitions, especially between the more technical definitions and their colloquial uses. You can get the sort of ""official"" definitions by reading the Wikipedia pages on those topics. But, that's not going to tell you how the terms are getting used by the MSM, politicians, and on social media.  So with that last part in mind, I'll add a bit on what you're not going to find from Wikipedia.  Fascism -- This gets used to describe some things which can be reasonably called fascist, such as certain totalitarian and anti-democratic policies, like locking up political opponents. But it's also used to describe aggressive use of the President's legitimate executive authority. And then it gets used to describe any sort of racist/sexist/etcist stances.  Socialism -- This is probably the most abused term in American politics, and both the left and right screw it up. It gets used to describe any sort of welfare policies, and then also used to describe more overtly redistributive policies. What gets very complicated here is that a single policy can be socialism, but that doesn't make the entire system socialist. For instance, increasing the capital gains tax in order to fund increased the EITC with be a socialist policy, but wouldn't turn the US into a socialist state.  Communism -- Most folks recognize countries like Russia and China as communist, but you'll be a lot of ""um actually"" folks who argue that the only *true* communism is stateless. You similarly get people who say the only *true* democracy is direct democracy. But of course both come in many different flavors.  Totalitarianism -- Wikipedia will tell you this requires a dictator, but the intuitive meaning would just be a government with *total* control or unlimited power, regardless of the actual structure of the government. For instance, if the US government was set up to allow Congress to pass whatever laws it wanted unchecked by the limits we actually have, that's arguably totalitarian (though you could split hairs between if they have to use the power to be totalitarian or not). Along the same lines, ""dictator"" is often confused with monarch. A monarch is a leader for life, while a dictator rules by dictates. If somehow a US president became President for Life, they'd not necessarily be a dictator unless the executive power was greatly expanded; they would be a monarch.",bl1y,2024-11-13T12:08:54,2

"AP (Associated Press) and Reuters are stringers that sell their reporting to news outlets all over the globe. They're very much the gold standard in journalism, but tend to be very brief (it's easier to avoid bias or even the appearance of bias, by saying less), they just print the facts as simply as possible.   I like to keep an eye on The Guardian. It's a left leaning publication, but it is out of the UK and even it's writers in the US are usually Brits. I find they often give an outsider view of American politics and news. Al Jazeera is useful that way too (Arabic language world news outlet), but its coverage is often overtly hostile to the US, which can be informative in its own way.   The legacy networks (ABC, CBS, NBC) all started in the era before the 24 hour news cycle, when networks made their money from their ""prime time"" entertainment programming and saw their news hour as a public service. They do a fair job of actual reporting these days, but have drifted into doing a lot of ""human interest"" fluff, because it's cheaper to produce and they struggle to maintain audience share in the current media environment.   Cable news is garbage, largely bloated with punditry and argumentative dialog. There are a few respectable voices there, but not many. I recommend you avoid it.

"> Gaza invaded a festival taking about approximately 800 civilians as hostages  It was more widespread than just the festival. And the numbers were 251 hostages taken and 1,180 killed (about 800 civilians and the rest were security forces).  >As expected Israel started counter attacks to free the hostages.  This was not the objective. Israel counter-attacked to destroy Hamas. Israel essentially sees this as a war against Hamas. Compare it to the US invasion of Europe during WWII. We didn't stop once France was liberated. We went into Germany to destroy the Nazi regime.  >Israel‚Äôs attacks are brutal and are impacting the civilians of Gaza way too heavily  This is where things get very complicated. In every military conflict there's bound to be civilian casualties. I've heard (but not actually seen the data) that Israel's civilian death rate is actually *low* compared to other *urban* conflicts.  >I don‚Äôt know how people can deem Gaza/Hamas innocent and side completely with either side of the story?  The pro-Gaza side's argument is that Israel is oppressing the Palestinians in such as a way as to justify armed resistance. While Israel was not occupying Gaza at the time, they effectively have a blockade on Gaza and control how much food and other material gets in, they have restrictions on fishing, etc. But that doesn't justify attacking civilian targets.  I think the best way to look at this is two countries at war, though this is made far more complicated by the fact that the Palestinians aren't recognized as their own nation.  When it comes to proportionality, there's two important concepts to understand. One is criminal proportionality where the offending party is punished in proportion to their crime committed. The other is proportionality in war. This isn't a tit-for-tat proportionality, but rather we measure proportionality relative to the military objective. So the question isn't ""Did Israel kill more civilians than Hamas?"" but rather ""Did Israel kill more civilians than it needed to in order to achieve its military objective in destroying Hamas?""  Think about the war with Japan. That started with the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. We didn't just go and attack Japanese ships until the numbers had been evened. We continued all the way up to bombing Tokyo and dropping two atomic bombs in order to defeat the entirety of Japan. (There's debate about whether dropping the bombs was justified, but the framework is thinking about in terms of the military objective, not comparing it to the numbers that died at Pearl Harbor.)  I'm far from an expert and can't say one way or the other to what extent Israel has gone too far in trying to pursue its military objective. But I can say that if we view this in a framework of war, Hamas's attack on October 7th was in no way justified. The civilian deaths weren't collateral damage in a justified military operation. Hamas's target was civilians and there was no legitimate military objective.",bl1y,2025-01-16T09:51:03,1

"I'll just respond to the website stuff to avoid writing an overly long post. I can get into the more broad DEI stuff though if you're really interested.  Very few people (even on the right) are opposed to celebrating minorities who have overcome real adversity. Take Maggie Lena Walker, daughter of a slave, who went on to found a bank in 1903 Virginia. She overcame some real adversity in her life.  Compare with the Navy promoting its first openly gay helicopter crew last year. DADT had already been repealed 14 years earlier, and discrimination against gays has dropped tremendously. Also, the crew was probably assembled for the sole purpose of being able to advertise that it happened. That's not an achievement, that's a publicity stunt.  Now going to the website purges, DOGE is going through with a chainsaw rather than a scalpel. They probably just did a broad word search on the webpages and pulled anything that got a hit, such as the Enola Gay (one of the planes that dropped an atomic bomb on Japan). DOGE may just be too incompetent to realize how much non-woke stuff they'd end up removing. Or the plan may be that rather than carefully reviewing things and pulling what they don't like, they're removing it all, then are planning to carefully review stuff to put back. We really don't know because there's very little transparency here.  And at the same time, there may be some malicious compliance going on where government workers who are opposed to DOGE remove stuff that shouldn't be removed in order to make the administration look bad.",bl1y,2025-03-23T07:18:21,1

However, Trump and MAGA have manipulated this notion and weaponized it to remove anything that is diverse or inclusive, even if doing so is nonsensical and discriminatory.

If Trump tries to force it to shutdown through an EO, then the Supreme Court will intervene.   However, as far as I'm aware, Trump can work to reduce the effectiveness of the DoE without having it shut down. He has done this with other governmental entities through EOs, such as [Executive Order 14238](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/20/2025-04868/continuing-the-reduction-of-the-federal-bureaucracy). **While he can't get rid of the DoE, his actions of trimming it and other departments down to the bare minimum will have an impact on the public.**",Kaius_02,2025-03-23T12:58:41,2

"In the UK, the prime minister is the ""head of government"", and the ""head of state"" is currently King Charles III.  From the British perspective, this is collapsed into the single person of the American President.  The distinction makes no sense to us and never has, but for them it's central.  Basically, the closest thing we have to a prime minister is the Speaker of the House (Mike Johnson).  He is head of the legislative branch, not the entire government, and is fourth in line for 'the throne.'  He was selected by his fellow House members and not by the voting public.  The second big difference is that, as with the Speaker, you don't get to be prime minister unless your party is in power.  The House and Senate could both flip Democrat in 2026, and Donald Trump will still be the president for two more years.  The third difference is, as we saw with Kevin McCarthy and with Liz Truss, if he or she fuck ups too much or pisses too many people off, they can be removed from the top spot by the party.  Whereas unless a US president is voted out, termed out, impeached and convicted, or drops dead, he's there to stay even if he goes completely 'mad king' and starts World War III.  Finally, even though a prime minister can be removed with astonishing speed, as we saw with Liz Truss, they can also stick around for a lot longer than the 8 years max a president gets.  Kind of like FDR did, which is why that amendment was passed.  The UK was stuck with Thatcher for a good 12 years or so.",ColossusOfChoads,2025-04-09T01:35:51,1
"> My question boils down to whether the leader of the party in power the president or the party chair. If it's the president, what about when the party does not hold the presidency, would it be the party chair or members of elective offices like Congress.  Whatever party has the Presidency, the party leader is invariably the President. They're the most visible spokesman, have the greatest individual power to set the policy agenda, and can veto bills that come out of Congress. There may be someone else actually calling the tune (as was sometimes the case with Pelosi during Obama's tenure), but everyone will still recognize the President as the leader.  When out of power, the party often doesn't have a meaningful leader. The party chair is usually someone relatively unknown to the public and doesn't have a lot of sway over elected politicians; it's more of a role in regards to party administrative things (think recruiting people to run in open seats, fundraising, etc), and doesn't do much in terms of policy.  We're seeing this right now in terms of the Democrats being fairly disorganized and rudderless, and having lots of internal arguments about the best course of action for the party.

Most major outlets have some clearly identifiable political leaning, even though many will swear up and down that they are nonpartisan.

Many Americans legitimately feel like every election is a life or death, freedom vs dictatorship sort of race, and it makes them feel increasingly hostile towards other Americans standing in the way of their preferred solutions to these problems.  Social media is also responsible for similar reasons. Most algorithms actively feed people content that enrages them, and also boxes them into echo chambers where millions of people can rile each other up. Nearly every American adult in the country uses social media, and it's had a transformative impact on how we research and think about politics.  There are other factors as well, but I believe the above are the most significant.  I definitely expect riots. There are millions of Americans who believe without exaggeration that Trump winning the presidency is analogous to Hitler taking over, and millions of other Americans who believe that Kamala is conspiring to steal the election.

There's a general perception that Republican policies do better for the economy than Democratic ones. It's debatable.  He also claims he'll do things like end the war in Ukraine, bring Russia to heel, and expel the illegal immigrants in the country (which is a serious problem currently) but almost all of it just boils down to the economy.

"The general rule of thumb is that you shouldn't really cross tab dive - polls already have a margin of error of a couple percentage points based on their overall sample size, so demographic groups within the polls have even larger margins of error. There have been a couple polls that solely poll Gen Z/young millennial voters, but there haven't been enough of those to draw a concrete conclusion IMO.    It's certainly possible if what we've read about men and women in Gen Z starting to diverge more between left and right is true, but I don't think we've seen any concrete evidence of Gen Z as a whole going 50/50 in actual elections. Just for example, in Nov 2023 in Ohio, exit polls showed voters 18-29 going 77%-23% in favor of abortion protections in the state constitution, while comparatively in 2020 the 18-29 age group went 57%-38% in favor of Biden.

In short, the President has immunity in two instances: Where the Constitution gives him the power to do something, and where Congress gives him the power to do something.  Neither Congress nor the states can criminalize an act done under the power given by the Constitution. If the Constitution says the President can do it, that carried with it the implication that it's legal for him to do so, and neither federal nor state law can override that.  When the power comes from a federal statute, there's a strong presumption of immunity. We're assuming Congress didn't authorize the President to do something illegal, so if they authorized it, we have a presumption they intended to not criminalize that behavior.

The Israel-Gaza war again makes everyone look bad. America has enabled Netanyahu for decades with Trump being the worst of all.

Some of these have proven health hazards, the vast majority are mostly inert. Whatever - let's say he actually bans the potentially dangerous ones. Now what? Well, it's really easy for a big corporation to substitute the old dye or additive for a new one that is slightly different yet functionally identical. Nothing changes for them. The trump administration get to claim victory while not doing any significant harm to big business.  You know what he *doesn't* mention? High fructose corn syrup, saturated fat, ultra processed foods with absurd caloric densities and no real nutrients. You know, the stuff that is actually really bad for you. Nothing about it! In fact he says that fruit snacks are a ""healthy snack"". Seriously? He's ignoring all the actual big problems of american nutrition *because* removing them would be very bad for business.

"Project 2025 is a 900-page policy wish list created by the Heritage Foundation, an influential conservative think tank.  Trump was not personally involved in Project 2025 and has denied that it's his agenda. The left has pointed out that a lot of people close to Trump were involved in it and use that to claim Trump is just playing coy. It's not very good evidence though, as any big project like that is naturally going to have people very interested in policy on it, and policy-minded people from the Trump administration of course wanted to continue doing that sort of work during the Biden administration. Economic Policy Institute (a left-leaning think tank) is headed by Obama's chief economist. Also at the top of EPI's leadership is Liz Shuler, President of AFL-CIO which endorsed Harris and she spoke at the 2024 DNC. Is this evidence that Biden secretly had EPI's policies as his own agenda? No. It's evidence that Washington is a small world.  The left also argues that even if Trump doesn't like Project 2025, many of the people he appoints do and will try to adopt its policies. That's a more compelling argument, but maybe only for smaller issues where the President isn't going to be directly involved. Big decisions are still going to come from the President.  It's also worth noting that Trump has brought in America First Policy Institute to advise his transition team, not Heritage Foundation, and Trump has publicly criticized some of Project 2025's ideas.  So is it what Trump and his team are going to try to implement? There's reason to think maybe, and I think better reason to think probably not. But also it's *900 pages*, so any conservative agenda is bound to overlap with part of it.  Now none of that answers what Project 2025 actually is in terms of substance. And again, it's 900 pages, so that's a long complicated answer.  Perhaps the biggest part of the agenda is to replace a lot of career bureaucrats with political appointees. The left is naturally concerned with politicizing the executive departments and losing people with technical expertise. On the other hand, the executive branch is inherently political and everyone there works for the President.

"There's a lot to unpack here.  For starters, some people will say they're a ""centrist"" when what they actually mean is ""I don't follow politics enough to have an opinion, so I'm just going to take a position I won't have to defend or get yelled at over."" That might explain the reaction you're getting if that's what people think you mean.  Now putting that aside, we have to distinguish centrists from moderates.  Moderates don't hold positions right down the middle. They hold some on the left and some on the right, and then also some in the middle. They have an eclectic set of positions that if averaged end up putting them roughly in the middle.  Then there's centrists, or at least what's implied by the *ist* part. That would be saying that whatever the question is, the right answer is the one in the middle.  If we say ""1"" on an issue is the left and ""10"" is the right, then on five different issues a moderate might take 3, 4, 6, 6, and 8. That person would be a right-leaning moderate.  A centrist is going to pick 5, 5, 5, 5, and 5.

Biden entered basically because it didn't look like the party was going to coalesce around someone who could beat Trump.  With Jeb not sparking nearly the outrage Trump did, there'd be less urgency to make sure someone would beat him, and I think Biden either stays out or doesn't win.  I don't think Sanders wins. The absence of Biden wouldn't suddenly get moderates to support the progressives.  I'd guess Warren. She was polling decently throughout, and got an especially good boost once Harris dropped, propelling her into second place for a few months. Without Biden there, I think she gets a lot of his voters. She's more progressive than he is, but is much more moderate than Sanders.

"What would be the aim of such a convention?  In the normal conventions, it's a PR event with a bunch of speeches to try to get people fired up for the upcoming presidential race. You could try that with midterms, but without a single figure to rally around it'd be a weird disjointed event (even more so than it is already). Few people are going to tune in to see a campaign speech for a member of Congress that's not in their district or even in their state.  I think the smarter thing to do would be a media blitz, similar to how Trump and Vance did a lot of podcasts (plus The View for Vance). They need to get a unified message for the party and a vision for the country, and go on places like Pod Save America, Club Random, and (of course) The Joe Rogan Experience.  One of the biggest flaws for the Democrats is that they've ceded pretty much the entire realm of both debate and longform discussions to the right.

People will point out that those systems worked during his first term, and they will hold for his second.   Maybe? Things are a lot different today, than they were in 2016. Trump attempted an insurrection and the overthrow of an election, and has suffered no real consequences for those crimes. For a greedy, amoral, habitual criminal like Donald Trump, that has to look like an open invitation to do as he pleases. In his first term, he largely staffed his administration with Republican insiders, people who were part of the establishment and knew how government worked. Those people generally resisted his worst efforts at overreach and abuse of power. Those people are gone, and he is clearly staffing with like minded miscreants and yes-men, this time. Most of them have no experience in government, no interest in maintaining normal functions of bureaucracy, and even less interest in benefiting the average American in any way.   Trump has hired (so far) 14 other billionaires to work in his administration. That should scare the shit out of most Americans. Even if his raging nonsense about Greenland or Canada evaporates like most of his threats and promises do, best case scenario, I think we should expect the Trump administration to engage in a wholesale rape of the American government. We will likely see very lucrative deals made to ""privatize"" government functions and property, much the way the Oligarchs in Russia did after the fall of the Soviet Union.

With that said, no, none of these things will happen. I'm not going to try to convince you that Trump is either good or bad for the country, just that nothing as enormously bad as an authoritarian state or the Holocaust is going to happen. By all accounts, Trump weakened the presidency in his first term. He deregulated the economy and reduced federal oversight in education, environmental policy, and other areas. And now, that's his biggest platform for the second term. He's creating a department made specifically to slash federal programs, moving federal jobs outside of D.C., is dismantling the Department of Education, and made broad promises of reducing spending, among other things.

"What Musk and DOGE are doing is bad, because they're not being honest about what they're actually doing, and they're doing it in an openly illegal manner.   Lets first look at exactly who these people are. Musk was ""appointed"" by President trump, to head an agency that does not actually exist, has not been funded by Congress, and has employed people who are accessing secure government computer networks, but have never received any kind of security clearance or had a background check conducted by the DOJ.  The current and most obvious objection to their actions is that they have stopped the function of a number of government agencies, and halted the use of funds that Congress has passed laws to allocate to certain sources. Musk is operating on Presidential authority, and the President has some leeway in moving funds around within the government, but he has no authority (as spelled out in the Constitution) to interfere with laws passed by Congress and funds allocated by Congress.   Trump and Musk claim that his goal is to reduce government waste and corruption. Yet his first efforts were aimed at USAID, an organization that accounts for less than 1% of Federal spending. That organization has been gutted, and is largely now completely dysfunctional.   Musk and his team now have access to the records of all Federal monetary disbursements, including Social Security, Veterans benefits, and income tax returns (which means, the details of most Americans financial records), but have given no reason for why they would need access to those records.   Curiously, while doing that, Musk and Trump have stopped all work at the Consumer Protection Bureau (these are the people who regulate banks to keep them from charging you all kinds of outrageous fees, remove faulty products from retail stores, etc.).  Finally, the DOGE Squad is not operating in a vacuum. While all of that is happening, Donald Trump is passing Executive Orders at an unprecedented rate. Among them was a freeze on all Federal hiring, while he is simultaneously offering Federal employees a ""buyout"" (currently paused by the courts). He is rapidly downsizing the number of experienced and competent employees working in Federal government, some of whom work in vitally important positions, like air traffic controllers in the FAA, CIA employees and FBI workers.   The fact that Elon Musk's companies receive billions in subsidies every year from the Federal government, and Musk now has a stranglehold on who gets money from the Federal government, should be the kind of conflict of interest that concerns all Americans.",BluesSuedeClues,2025-02-11T09:39:13,7

(3) Elon's team are a bunch of kids with no government experience. They don't trust Elon or his team to not fuck stuff up -- even if they agreed with the mission overall.  (4) There's concerns about privacy with all the information they're getting access to, as well as conflicts of interest and questions about if Elon is trying to gather information to use for his own businesses.  (5) There's concern about the legality of what's happening. When Congress appropriates funds for a program, the government has to spend that money.

"If you are looking for a legitimate answer and are not simply being disingenuous as an opening to attack people...  I dont know of anyone who is anti-Ukraine.  I only know of people who think U.S. interference in Ukraine was a mistake.  Ukraine is an extremely corrupt Eastern European state.  Its country is highly xenophobic and bigoted.  They do not want to become part of the 'West.'  They have openly resisted reforms every step of the way to join the E.U., and are now increasingly becoming a Christian Nationalist state.  The fact is the U.S. has been trying to provoke Russia into armed conflict since it became 'Russia.'  Soviet Union made significant reforms to join the West, and instead Europe rejected it, the U.S. walked back its promises.  As a result Putin was elected, Russia doubled down on Nationalism and focused on rebuilding its empire.  The U.S. and Europe then proceeded to block it from the WTO for 19 years.  The U.S. pushing influence, troops, equipment, conducting military exercises closer and closer to Russian borders.  A long series of escalations to play off of Russian brinkmanship.  Under Obama you had Biden going to Kiyv to threaten Ukraine to end subsidies on gas for their people and to increase tariffs on Russian gas to benefit foriegn U.S. gas interests.  Or they would use their influence at the IMF to end their roughly 17 billion dollar loan.  Which was a violation of international law.  Ukraine basically told the U.S. to fuck off and elected a president hostile towards the U.S., the U.S. cut off the loan.  Ukrainian Parliament refused to establish reforms demanded by the E.U.  Without the money their economy relied on Ukraine was forced to cave into U.S. blackmail.  Which caused their gas prices to increase by 50%, which led to the civilian unrest that caused the Euromaidan protests.  U.S. had already started to interfere with Ukrainian domestic political affairs.  CIA was in contact with far-right neo Nazi militant groups like Azov and Right Sector.  U.S. was directly involved in the protests, and the coup.  These same groups had been targeting minorities, killing civilians in the protest and the civil war that followed.  The coup itself was a violation of Ukrainian law.  With U.S. involvement violating international law.  As a result Crimea holds a vote to consider independence since Ukraine illegally removed the constitution that bound Crimea to Ukraine.    And then you have Russia illegally seizing Crimea.  At the start of the Russian invasion people are fleeing to the borders and public transportation bans minorities with signs that say 'no blacks.'  Student dormitories are being bombed, and children from Africa, India, etc are having to contact their embassies to arrange private transportation because the Ukrainian government wont do anything about the situation.  Zelenskyy gets into Office you literally have a former U.S. State Department official in his government.  He bans all leftist, progressive, socialist, anti-war political parties, political parties that have zero relationship to Russia.  He consolidates all network media under one state run network and removes press accreditation of foriegn media that doesnt explicitly repeat state sanctioned propaganda.  All this is happening while all the leadership of the far right militants and parliament get positions in the military or Zelenskyys government.  Avoz that was only created in 2014 is walking around with Nazi insignias, refuse to change their Wolfsangel symbol?  Mentioning this fact on any social media gets you banned while BBC shows video and pictures of Zelenskyy literally standing next to soldiers with deathshead nazi patches.  The U.S. in all likelihood bombs the Nord Stream pipeline as its overproducing oil and gas out of the Permian Basin, U.S. residents are forced to subsidize the cost of construction of gas terminals and infrastructure to export gas to Europe and Ukraine.  Americans pay increasingly higher utility bills for what reason exactly?  To take control over Ukraine, over land U.S. gas companies already said thanks but no thanks.  Said that the U.S. would need to further subsidize the construction of infrastructure in Ukraine and this was prior to the Russian invasion.  And now that region is littered with cluster bombs and mines, flattened completely from shelling and missile strikes.  No one is rebuilding it in anyones lifetime.  A rational view of the situation is that you have two shitty world powers engaged in a global conflict and Ukraine was unfortunate enough to get stuck in the middle.  The simplest solution is just to stop U.S. escalation.  Thats not going to happen.  Trumps solution is worse which is withdraw and surrender.",neverendingchalupas,2025-03-05T17:49:06,0

"One of the current ideological points on the right-wing of the American political spectrum is the idea that an unborn child has the same rights as a person already born. There are a number of states where Republicans are pushing to enact laws to enforce this ""right"".   It's a bizarre stance to take, that produces a host of problematic issues. If ""life begins at conception"", is every fertilized zygote legally a person? This thinking would end IVF procedures as they are done today, because that process involves producing a great many zygotes that will never be brought to term. Is the fertility clinic legally required to house those zygotes in perpetuity? What if the power goes out and the zygotes perish? Is that murder because the clinic didn't have a backup power source? Are these zygotes owed child support? Should they be issued Social Security numbers and passports? Can they be used by the parents for a tax credit?  The logic here reminds me of the Mormon groups who retroactively baptize dead people, into the LDS church. Like those Mormons, Republicans are choosing to ""protect"" a constituency that isn't conscious, has no understanding or appreciation for what they are doing, and cannot opt out of their attentions. To imagine yourself ""moral"" for doing something to/for a person who cannot consent or object to what you're doing, strikes me as a deeply unhealthy mindset. It sounds a lot like the arrogance that produced horrors like ""Kill the Indian, save the man.""   I'd have more respect for the Republican jihad on women's rights, if they showed a fraction of the interest in the well being of living children, that they do for the unborn.",BluesSuedeClues,2025-04-22T09:30:46,2

"First, the only type of voter fraud that voter ID prevents is in-person voter impersonation fraud, which is when somebody physically goes to a polling location, claims to be another voter who's eligible to vote at that location, and casts a vote in that person's name. They have to hope that the person they're trying to impersonate hasn't already voted or else they get arrested and go to jail for a long time. Despite multiple attempts over the past couple of decades to prove that this is a significant issue in our elections, nobody has been able to find more than a handful of cases per election. As a result, voter ID seems to be a solution to a problem that doesn't really exist.  Second, it's been repeatedly proven that there are a significant number of eligible voters who don't have a form of ID that's valid for voting, so voter ID laws mean those people won't be able to vote unless they're able to get an ID (which many can't). On top of that, the party that's pushing for voter ID laws is also well known for wanting to defund the agencies that provide IDs, meaning those agencies have to close locations, cut staff, cut open hours, etc. all of which makes it even harder to get an ID.  Given that voter ID laws would likely stop no more than a handful of in-person voter impersonation fraud cases and disenfranchise many thousands of eligible voters in the process, it seems like a nonsensical policy.",Moccus,2024-11-02T16:25:16,10

So if the Trump administration chooses to just ignore court rulings, we're in a Constitutional crisis, and nobody really knows how that will play out.   In the instance of what you're asking, if the Trump administration were to start issuing edicts about which citizens can travel, when and where, there would be the same problem, but in reverse. The courts would immediately slap that kind of thing down, as being unconstitutional. And while the courts couldn't send Marshall's to all airports and border crossings to see if their injunction is being enforced, could Trump?  The President controls the FBI, the military and a lot of other agencies, even TSA agents. Would those people actually comply with such an order if the courts had stopped it? The heads of those departments are all Trump loyalists and they would likely give the order. Would the people on the ground actually follow those orders? Or would they just start quitting, or making ""mistakes"" and engaging in widespread malicious compliance so that the orders were totally ineffective?  **Short answer,** you don't need to worry, at least not yet.

"There's two major reasons why there are so many different takes in spite of the polls being discounted (granted I'm not aware of any showing ""overwhelming"" support in the swing states- the polls I've seen still keep him within 6 points above or less, and some even show Biden winning):  1. The polls have lost a lot of reputation over the last ten years or so. 2016's **national** polls were actually pretty close (and more accurate than 2012's!), but the state ones were kind of wrong. 2018's were also pretty off. 2020's were a disaster; even the pro-Trump ones were pretty off. While 2020 can be partially excused due to stuff like COVID, getting two national elections ""wrong"" in a row mean the polling data is more discounted than usual. Reports on things like how Americans are responding to phone polls less and less are not helping. Even as late as 2020 you'd be the norm and the others viewed as wishcasters.  2. There have been weird countervailing factors. Biden has been much better at fundraising over the last five years (although allegedly Trump might finally be learning how to make money). The Biden Decline narrative has been matched with or to a degree even replaced by the Trump decline. The economy is improving and Biden is making moves on immigration to blunt Trump there. More importantly, Trump is doing strange things that no winning candidate has done in decades, or perhaps ever, like scrounging for votes among Libertarians. To be blunt, Trump is not acting like he thinks he has it in the bag- which either suggests he believes the polls as much as the Discord guys do, does believe them but this is some 6D underwater ping-pong maneuver he forgot to pull in 2016 and 2020 or didn't think he needed to do until now, or he really has left the realm of reality by, say, preferring to go to Chicago the week of the RNC instead of showing he's not just some crazy whack job who doesn't want to go to a ""horrible"" city like Milwaukee but thinks the site of the 1968 DNC Dumpster Fire is somehow better. *Random anecdote about sharks that even Reagan didn't engage in when he was more clearly having issues*  I think people are partially reacting to this weird dissonance.

"Speaking mainly for myself, the left has mixed feelings about the issue.  In the California I grew up in (80s and 90s), ""illegal immigrants"" was quite frequently a proxy for ""the goddamned Mexicans"" as a whole.  Many of us Mexican-Americans knew how to read between the lines, and Prop. 187 was a monumental overreach.  That's why we didn't become as amenable to the GOP line as our cousins in Texas have, and why the California GOP has lost so much power.  To be sure, you'd be hardpressed to find people who hated illegal immigrants more than my grandparents did, even though they experienced far more personal and systemic racism than I ever did.  Of course, they hated most legals, too.  Their own parents came over in 1910, and they looked down pretty hard on the people who came over in the 1970s and 1990s.  Ironically, that early 20th century wave just kind of up and left while bullets were flying.  They'd be classed as refugees today.  I'm not sure anybody had any papers; it wasn't far removed from the wild west days, when people just kind of came and went across the border in either direction.  The crackdown really came in the 1930s when displaced poor whites found themselves in need of the same bottom tier jobs.  I don't think my great-grandparents would have any legal pathway today.  The same goes for those of many white people reading this.    At the same time, we are a nation of laws and you have to draw the line somewhere.

Second, by the time Harris became state AG, [California had changed its possession laws](https://archive.is/74dO) and the overwhelming majority of possession cases were downgraded from a misdemeanor to basically a parking ticket-level offense. Marijuana convictions dropped sharply under this new law.  Harris *was* in charge of these decisions when she was DA of San Francisco, before she was AG. During that time, around 2000 people were prosecuted for marijuana offenses in San Francisco--this includes possession, sale and cultivation. But the overwhelming majority of them were funneled into diversionary programs, not prison. Only 45 of them went to prison.

The counties that really matter include the cities and they're blue or purple (maybe not York or Eerie, not sure). Basically, there are purple ""swing counties"" in PA; if you win them there's no realistic way to lose the state. Dem enthusiasm has increased and, if enthusiasm is high enough and translates to Dem turnout and independents break close to or over 50% for Harris (realistic, IMO), it's nearly mathematically impossible for Republicans to win, as there are 300k+ more registered Democrats.  2. Anecdotally, I live in a ""swing county"" (Lehigh, though it does lean D and is less swingy than some others). There's no ""Trumpy"" feel in the air like there was in 2016 and 2020 (pretty sure).

People generally don't use the term in this way.,bl1y,2024-06-09T11:43:24,5
"> What is the goal exactly of this?  The first thing to understand is that in the federal government, you basically have two types of employees: civil servants and political appointees. Civil servants are typically your lower level employees who have long-term careers working for the federal government. They don't get fired and replaced when a new president comes in. Political appointees on the other hand are typically the higher level people who set high level policy for the agencies they run. They typically get replaced when a new president comes in.  You may have heard Trump and the Republicans blaming various problems on ""the deep state"" over the past several years. They're referring to those civil servants who are long-term employees. Their argument is that these people are so set in their ways from working for so long in the government that they stand in the way of the types of major reforms to the way the federal government functions.  The goal of Project 2025 is to try to defeat ""the deep state"" and institute massive reforms. They plan to do this by first reclassifying a bunch of civil servant positions as political appointees, so the president would be able to fire a lot more employees and replace them with loyalists who will go along with reforms. They also want to make sure they do this quickly, because they know they only have limited time to get it done before an election comes around and potentially makes it impossible, so they're already starting to recruit and vet people for all of the positions they'll need to fill so that they're ready to start appointing them on the first day of a presidency. They also want to make sure that these people are actually loyal to Trump and won't stand in his way like a lot of people did in his first term. If they succeed at getting a bunch of these people in place, then it makes it a lot easier for them to start tearing apart a lot of the federal government agencies.  > As a citizen How can we prevent this from happening?  Vote for Biden in November. Try to convince people you know to vote for Biden in November. Volunteer for Biden's campaign. Vote for the Democratic senator if there's one running in your state this election, and especially if it's an important race.  > What are even the pros to this?  If you're a Republican who agrees that the federal government is too big, then the pro would be that the federal government probably gets undermined a lot and stops enforcing a lot of stuff.  If you think Trump is the greatest man alive and brilliant, then you get a lot of pros because you get a bunch of people in the government who will do whatever Trump says.  If you think the federal government is generally a beneficial entity for a lot of people, then there probably are no pros.  If you're concerned about what Trump's first term would have been like if Pence hadn't been there to stand up to him when he wanted to stop the count of the electoral votes, if the various people hadn't stood up to him when he wanted to appoint Jeffrey Clark as Acting AG to push election lies, if Don McGahn hadn't stood up to him when he wanted to have Hillary Clinton and James Comey prosecuted for no reason, etc., then there are probably no pros.  > This has been mentioned years ago, how come it will be able to be in effect soon?  It's a plan that was put together after Trump's first term. It's meant to correct a lot of the perceived failures that prevented Trump from enacting a lot of policy changes. It will be able to go into effect soon if Trump becomes president again in January 2025.  > Is trump winning?  The race is pretty much even right now, so it could go either way.

There's a lot of administrative rulemaking involved that could be challenged in the courts. That might delay a lot of changes, and even conservative judges haven't always sided with Trump's executive actions, so some might get stopped. That's especially likely to happen if his team skips required steps in the rulemaking process, which becomes more likely if they go through with their plan to purge a lot of the career civil servants from government, because those are the types of people who have the institutional knowledge to navigate the rulemaking process properly.  Other proposed changes require legislation to be passed by Congress, so if the Democrats can take the House or if the Republicans in the Senate refuse to get rid of the filibuster, then that would prevent a lot of the proposed changes.

It was created well before I was old enough to vote.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century  -----------------  I have been told to look into 2025  by a few people and and finally have. Unitary Executive theory sounds scary but it allows the president to have more authority over the executive branch. Also when I looked into it I saw some stuff I liked, slashing funding for the FBI, DOJ and DHS all sound great to me. When it gets into socially conservative stuff it sounds a bit scary but like the other reply said it probably couldn't even be done. If anyone knows how to thwart the plans it's agencies like the FBI.  -----------------  When it comes down to the social conservative stuff though, I wasn't in public school too long ago and we had crappy programs like DARE and Abstinence Only Sex Education. We didn't have gender identity stuff  in middle or high school.  We had Sex Education in 5th 9th and 10th grade and definitely could've done better on the consent concept.  ----------  The abortion ban was awful and it's awful for all the women who live in those states but I was in college when all the lgbt stuff was coming out and it was heavily in my major and the social sciences. One thing that conservatives are correct about is that radical gender theory, radical race theories and radical lgbt theories were taught in select majors around Obamas second term. I also knew what I was majoring in so I didn't necessarily disagree with it. I agreed with a lot of it. That said I'm not a parent and I wouldn't know what I'd think if I were. By the Trump era it seemed to be part of the Democrat Playbook to double down on the gay/trans stuff and promote it to younger kids.  ----------  2025 doesn't necessarily violate the separation of powers as it gives the president more control over the executive branch. There would still be the legislative and judicial brances..The framers didn't foresee a gigantic administrative state so it'll be tough to say whether it's constitutional or not.  -------------  I think that if Trump wins he'll wuss out on any Project 2025 stuff.

With less time to vet the nominees, there's a higher chance of this happening. It's unlikely Dems will pick up votes with a great nominee; it's mostly an opportunity to lose some.  Also, having Sotomayor step down so close to the election would look exactly like what you described, Democrats being afraid of a Trump victory.

"To give a short answer, no the immunity wouldn't pass down (probably).  In the opinion, Roberts frequently says ""Trump and his co-conspirators"" did this and did that. But he only ever says ""Trump is immune"" of this or ""Trump is not immune"" of that. This leads me to believe that anybody going alongside a president doing illegal activities is not covered.  Even if immunity did pass down from Trump to the FBI of his secretary, I don't think Trump would have any immunity here. Absolute immunity only applies to the President's preclusive Constitutional powers and none of your hypotheticals invoke Constitutional powers like appointing judges or giving pardons. Presumptive immunity is relatively easy to pierce through, because the prosecution could show that arbitrarily ordering the bugging of an entire town or stealing coffee isn't essential for the Executive branch to function.",FriedinAlaska,2024-07-14T19:59:36,2
"Possibly very briefly, but not long-term. There's zero historical evidence that assassination attempts improve your long-term popularity. Three American presidential candidates have been shot on the campaign trail (Teddy Roosevelt, RFK, and George Wallace), and in every case, they or their party's candidate lost the subsequent election by a lot.  There is some minor evidence it could provide a short-term boost. Wallace won a couple primaries he otherwise probably wouldn't have won in the wake of his shooting. When Reagan was shot, he received a boost of about ten points to his approval ratings that lasted about 2 months. But I wouldn't expect that to follow here, because of different circumstances. Reagan's assassination attempt was very early in in his presidency, at a point where the electorate tends to be pretty positive about the president anyway, and it was in a far less partisan era. There just aren't that many Americans who have moveable opinions on Trump. Reagan's would-be assassin was also mentally ill and his attack wasn't driven by politics, which made it easy for people across the political spectrum to have sympathy for the president.  The 24-hour news cycle also just means stories--even big stories--have little long-term impact. I know this is going to sound crazy, but this is a busy week politically, and the casual follower (as opposed to Trump die-hards) will mostly have moved past this by the end of it.",anneoftheisland,2024-07-15T10:56:10,6

He regularly seems like a doddering old man, especially recently.

"Reading more about this guy, he seems to just be a conman.  He published *many* times that his predictions are about the popular vote, not the electoral college. He did this in 1990, 1996, 2011, 2012, and three times in 2016 before the Trump vs Clinton race.  Then after Trump won, suddenly he claimed to be right, despite Clinton winning the popular vote.  He then tried to claim the popular vote in 2016 was close enough to be ""essentially a tie."" His system isn't supposed to be so fined tuned that it can account for every little thing on election day that can move the vote count (think about something like news networks calling the 2000 Florida race early and that affecting turnout). The margin in 2016 was 2.1%, which is pretty substantial. 2000 was closer, just 0.5%, and he counts that as a win for him, not a virtual tie.  Also, a lot of the predictions were elections that anyone with a pulse would have gotten right. In 2012, Obama was a very popular incumbent, no surprise he won. In 2008, any Democrat would have defeated any Republican. In 2004, W. Bush was an incumbent with a strongish approval rating. 1996, Clinton was an incumbent and very popular (he had a friggin 16% lead in the polls). In 1992, following the DNC Clinton had a 24% lead over HW Bush. And 1984, probably the most easily predicted race of all time; Reagan won 49 states.

In the US, ""race"" is used to refer to very broad groups: Black, White, Asian, etc. We don't consider Irish, Kenyan, or Japanese to be a race; those would be ethnicities or nationalities.  Then there's one weird group, Hispanics. We think of it both as an ethnicity and a race. It's simultaneous a very prominent White ethnic group (at least White Hispanics are; Black Hispanics are obviously not part of that), but also gets given equal treatment to racial groups in most discussions about race. It's a bit like Washington, DC. It's not a state, but for lots of discussions we kind of think of it as a state (especially around elections since DC gets 3 electoral college votes).  >As they're only umbrella terms meant to describe a persons appearance- not their culture, history or traditions.  In the US race is not synonymous with culture, history or tradition. There's obviously a very strong connection to the two ideas, as members of a race often share culture, history, and tradition, but race in the US is about genetic lineage.

"There's [plenty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polling_for_United_States_presidential_elections); the most famous  in recent history is probably the 1992 election where third party candidate Ross Perot actually *led the polls* for a while, but that time was admittedly screwed up by his decision to leave the race for a while and his decision to come back later- and the debate helping him to bring back his numbers. Perot saw a drop off both in his initial and final numbers in his 96 run, Nader failed to regain the 6% he got early on and placed a point or two below his final numbers in 2000, and neither of the 2016 third parties got anywhere near their initial polling.  There's other evidence too in that link, such as John B. Anderson in the 1980 election placing well below the ~20% he got in ~February through July. Looking back further Henry Wallace (1948) never recovered, although Strom Thurmond (1948) and George Wallace (1968) actually held on.  Given that RFK isn't a Dixiecrat though he's more likely to level off. The closest parallel to him seems to be a Bizarro version of John B. Anderson, a Rockefeller Republican who also attracted disaffected Carter voters- in that Anderson was an establishment type who attracted people who had severe problems with Reagan, weren't conservative, and/or didn't care for Carter due to his issues at the time, whereas RFK Jr. seems to attract liberals who see the famous name and admittedly Trumpian Republicans who seem to prefer a different flavor that might be closer to their position on other things (e.g., believes vaccines are evil but also thinks global warming is something that must be fought).",Theinternationalist,2024-07-24T16:44:25,5

"1: bias exist, also polling is inherently erronious compared to the entire election. An entire election is the sum of all the anecdotal opinion, or personal opinion. The polls are trying to capture that with 500 or 1000 people, each.

There are states evidence to the contrary, but it is the general that it favors republicans. There are a slew of states that favor kamala each, individually, but the chances she wins all of them are small.

There is not expected to be any 3rd party candidate this year to upset and take a whole region like wallace did to the south.  6: The recipe for violence is already there, but Trump stirs it by suggesting there's an uncontrollable deep state, or the Dems are controlling this, and that, and we *need* to stop them. There's always animosity from liberal to conservative and vice versa, riots against police action, which is not to be confused with political violence. Jan 6th was political violence. Riots after police activity is political in nature, but it's not politically charged to begin with. It's basic rights to begin with, which makes it different as one comes from a definitive misdeed.

"I don't think the premise is true. If you understand how gerrymandering works, it's actually more likely to contribute to wave elections than to prevent them. The way you do it is to try to cram all the other parties' votes into one district and spread your own out--so instead of having two districts that are D+10 and two that are R+10, you create one D+30 district and then have three R+5 districts. In an average year, this means that the gerrymandering party wins more elections than they should--in this case, the Republicans would win three seats instead of the two they would have won with an ungerrymandered map. But in a wave year, where there's an eight point swing towards the Democrats, the Republicans actually get wiped out completely and lose all four of those seats, whereas with an ungerrymandered map, they would have held two. So gerrymandered maps cause more swinginess, not less.  We just had a wave election in 2018. There's no evidence it's impossible now. The fact that it hasn't happened in the last few years is because 2020 and 2024 were driven by high, fairly even levels of both pro- and anti-Trump sentiment, and in 2022 what should have anti-Biden backlash was tempered by anti-Dobbs backlash. 2026 should likely be less even, unless Trump pursues a much less chaotic economic agenda than he's proposed, and we may end up seeing another wave.",anneoftheisland,2024-11-09T11:50:47,2

"Why the World Wars happened takes a *super* long answer. Here are some short answers for both, which do not include a lot of important context.  The immediate trigger for WWI was when Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, was assassinated by a Serbian nationalist. Each side had a complex system of treaties which dragged other nations, who were already at odds with each other, into the ensuing war. The United States also eventually joined because of public support, Germany destroying their merchant ships with unrestricted submarine warfare, and partially to fulfill Woodrow Wilson‚Äôs vision for a new international community, which helped create the League of Nations.  WW2 was also caused by a combination of things. At this point, the world was suffering from the Great Depression, and some countries, namely Italy and Germany, looked to fascism as a solution. In Germany‚Äôs case, they were also bitter about the terms of their surrender in WWI, and blamed minority groups, especially Jews, for ‚Äústabbing them in the back.‚Äù At the same time, Japan was invading China in the second Sino-Japanese War. These three nations formed the Axis Powers to support each other‚Äôs quests of territorial expansion. It became a World War when Germany, with the help of the Soviet Union, who also wanted to expand their territory, invaded Poland, leading to other nations, after years of attempting to forestall conflict, finally declaring war on Germany, leading to full scale war across most of Europe. The United States eventually joined after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor. When the U.S. declared on Japan, Germany declared on them (even though they totally didn‚Äôt need to).

"In the US, the Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the federal government from using the military for law enforcement. States can use their National Guard, but once the National Guard is federalized it falls under the Posse Comitatus Act.  However, the Insurrection Act provides an exception to the Posse Comitatus Act.  Nothing going on right now looks like an insurrection in the normal meaning of the word, but the Insurrection Act is actually pretty broad. You've probably seen pictures of the National Guard escorting black students during desegregation in Alabama. That was through the Insurrection Act. It was more recently used to restore order in the US Virgin Islands after Hurricane Hugo, and during the Rodney King race riots in LA. That was the last time it was used (1992). Trump talked about using it in response to the BLM rioting, but ultimately did not.  Now a big thing to understand here is that invoking the Insurrection Act isn't what most people think about when they hear ""martial law."" It allows the National Guard to be used for law enforcement, but doesn't suddenly change what the laws are. There wouldn't suddenly be a military dictatorship. It's more like if the President decided to hire and deploy 100,000 more FBI agents and US martials. The President can already use federal law enforcement to enforce federal law, and the Insurrect Act essentially gives him a lot more law enforcement officers.  There is no legislative approval needed for the Insurrection Act, though they are needed to fund the military. The Constitution limits Congress to funding the military for 2 year periods, but typically we have annual budgets. Additionally, Congress could amend the Insurrect Action, though this would require a veto-proof supermajority (since naturally the President would veto it).  Invoking the Insurrection Act could also be challenged in court, but the act is pretty broad and there's a lot of precedent for it being used for many things that look nothing like an insurrection, so the legislature is the better check on the President.  And the biggest things to keep in mind here is that Republicans have the tiniest majority in the House and a pretty small majority in the Senate. Anything resembling martial law would be incredibly unpopular among both parties. Any attempt would be more likely to result in Trump being impeached than martial law actually going into effect.

The Vice President has 2 jobs; They act as a tie-breaker in the Senate and they support the President's agenda, in whatever capacity they are asked. For Harris to publicly second guess Biden's decisions, would be a betrayal of President Biden and a betrayal of her job responsibilities. It would rightly be seen as her sacrificing integrity in hopes of improving her chances of getting elected.   If Harris made any error in that moment, it was that she didn't admonish the person asking that question by telling her ""As the current Vice President of the United States, I will not be sitting here on public television, criticizing my President.

And that answer on The View was hardly an aberration for Harris. It's not like she routinely gave great answers, but got bad advice on that one. She routinely fumbled in interviews.  For instance, following the debate, she went on a news talk show and was asked to elaborate on her economic plan. Rather than going into more detail as the hosts wanted, she repeated her ""I was raised middle class"" spiel and vague ""opportunity economy"" line.  At a CNN town hall she was asked if she could accomplish only one goal as president, what would it be, what's the most important thing to her. Her answer was that there's not just one, then she fumbles around talking about bipartisanship, before finally giving a list of policies which weirdly starts with housing.  Her interview on Fox News was a total mess, not the least of which is again failing to say what she'd do differently than Biden, even after seeing the negative reaction it got on The View. A lot of folks on the left have talked about Baier kept cutting her off, but he did so only after she started giving non-answers. In the entire interview she answered exactly 1 question.  And of course there's her flip flopping on issues, fracking in particular. She said made her position clear in 2020, and MSM factcheckers correctly pointed out that she didn't. She was referring to the VP debate where she talked only in terms of Biden's position on fracking. After the factchecks came out, she continued to repeat that she'd made her position clear.

An invasion only lasting 60 days would be pointless if the goal is to annex territory.

"The conflict  of Israel/Palestine is complex and goes back to the late 1800s, maybe before. There are entire classes and books about the topic.   It has to do with colonization, when the British Empire controlled Palestine, known as the British Mandate of Palestine. Following the Holocaust, the United Nations together decided to divide the British Mandate of Palestine into 3 parts: Israel (a Jewish State), Palestine (Arab state), and the West Bank. Essentially, the state of Israel was created to give European Jews a homeland, but it also displaced almost a million Arabs, who had to leave their home that was now in the Jewish state of Palestine. This sparked a series of conflicts and wars, and the area has been one of high tension essentially since 1947. Palestinians claimed that the British empire had no right to give away land that wasn‚Äôt theirs to begin with, and had been occupied by Palestinians for centuries. Jews, however, also considered this their Holy land, had been occupants of it thousands of years before according to their traditions, (and were displaced in Europe after experiencing the Holocaust.)  Essentially, both Jews and Arabs claim ancestral right to the land, and that has (obviously) been complicated. There have also been land disputes, settlements built on non-Israeli land, etc.   This is a gross simplification, so take it with a grain of salt and watch videos/read books on the topic.",Sun-Mountain-208,2025-03-04T21:04:46,2

">When are we going to fix the infrastructure of the US?  Like what specifically? Infrastructure is a collaboration between federal, state and local governments. So it depends on what infrastructure you're referring to. Try calling, emailing or visiting the relevant jurisdiction and asking. The water lines in my city aren't being updated because a local levy failed for example.   >Can someone explain to me why my tax dollars are fueling foreign wars while the country collapses from the inside out.   Yeah but it depends which war.  For example , the Ukrainie-Russia war has turned into a proxy for a semi-cold Russia-America war but the US doesn't need to send soldiers. So American politicians and foreign policy strategists view this as a war America needs to fight- and at a discount by not funding a full-out traditional style of war where it's their own soldiers, logistics etc.   >Do my tax dollars have anything to do with funding these foreign conflicts?  I guess it depends who you are. Most tax revenue comes from the wealthy. And the wealthy buy up American debt that's funding the war. Is this the sort of answer you want? I don't know what kind of answer you want other than yes but not as much as Bill Gates.   >Does this not boost inflation every time we approve these huge bills?  Not necessarily but it's likely. Considering America's economic philosophy right now the answer is almost certainly yes since tax increases and interest rate hikes are both unlikely. It depends on how much money there is in circulation.   There could be a scenario where the US raises taxes, pays off war debts but holds some revenue in the reserve. This would lower inflation. This isn't how America operates currently though. Raising taxes and interest rates while sequestering cash would require replacing most of Congress and the Fed.    >I apologize if I‚Äôm basing my animosity towards the federal government  Well. Let me bring up 2 points.   1. The current federal government is holding onto a fairytale where we can have war without war. We can fight a war for the sake of a new conception of peace that doesn't involve conquest, reparations or spoils for the victor. What do the American people get besides a vague ideal of ""global peace""?  2. The US is putting the interests of a useless ""international order"" before their own in a completely subservient way. A long war involving Russia is bad for Europe and in a direct relationship, good for the US. Europe depends on Russian oil. Oil prices go up -> Europen manufacturing costs go up -> there is an opening for the US to step in and take over Europe's manufacturing territory. That's more  $ for the US. The US doesn't have to and isn't going to take advantage of this but they should be telling Europe the more the US solves your own economic problems from this war, the more you're going to do for us. But America isn't demanding anything in return.   If this isn't disgruntling, what is?",metal_h,2024-04-24T14:50:41,3

But it is good that you're not like others who are so far gone that they're in the mindset of I'm right and everyone else is wrong. Inflation is normal now, although it was bad in 2022. The violent crime rate has been stagnant for over a decade and it used to be way worse decades ago. Our number of illegal immigrants per capita has also been stagnant and it actually peaked in 2007. And our country is a great place to live. That's the reality.  When it comes to inflation, printing money \*can\* cause inflation. The type of inflation you're talking about is what happens when growth in demand for goods outpaces the growth in the supply of those goods. Businesses see that they're selling out, so they capitalize on that and raise their prices because they can. Basically, spending divided by goods = price, and so an increase in spending means an increase in price. That's inflation. Consumers in the US spend about 18 trillion a year. If that falls by 100 billion and the government offsets it by spending 100 billion, it washes out and it doesn't cause inflation. Government spending also does not cause inflation if the increase in goods production is enough to match the increase in spending.",[deleted],2024-04-25T00:24:19,3

Are the people who were whining about the price of eggs really that eager to see a massive spike in the cost of consumer goods and raw materials?   His mass deportation plan would also raise prices on construction, all agricultural and meat products in the United States, as well as vast swaths of construction and hospitality services, wile spending billions on an action that would produce social unrest and destroy communities across the country, while throwing away hundreds of billions of the American tax base.

Trump lost in 2020, largely because of his absolutely disastrous COVID response.

Do some critical thinking.  \-House republicans and Trump do not want the border crisis resolved before the election because doing so knocks the wind out of the sails of his campaign. That's why they started spewing lies about the border bill. Some went so far as to pass a censure against republican senator James Lankford for literally just negotiating the border bill.

"When it comes to the American presidency, the incumbent president basically *always* runs again, because being the incumbent gives you an advantage with voters in terms of sheer name recognition--even if they don't like you, it takes a lot to get people to vote for the devil they don't know over the one they do. In recent years, [the bonus you get from incumbency has been growing smaller, but still offers 2-3 points advantage](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-was-incumbency-worth-in-2018/).  Your approval ratings have to be *really* bad for it to be worth it to the party to sacrifice that incumbency bonus. The only time it's happened in the era of the modern presidential election was in 1968, when Lyndon Johnson performed badly in the early primaries and his approval ratings dipped into the mid-30s over his handling of the Vietnam War, and he decided not to continue running again. (Worth noting that a mid-30s approval rating was basically unprecedented in 1968, and Johnson spent most of his early presidency above 50% ... nowadays both Trump and Biden have spent most of their presidencies hanging out in the high 30s.)  Also because of the benefits of incumbency, it's basically impossible to win a primary against an incumbent president. This has never happened, and because it's so impossible, usually the only people who even try are cranks. The closest a Democratic candidate has gotten to winning a primary against an incumbent president was [Ted Kennedy's challenge against Jimmy Carter in 1980](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries).  So are there politicians out there who could probably outperform Biden against Trump? Yeah, absolutely. But they didn't beat Biden in the 2020 primary, and they didn't bother to run against him in the 2024 primary because they knew they'd lose.

"First off, most of the polling over the last year showed that Biden would lose to Trump.  Secondly a lot of your questions re: the blame game become ""which came first the chicken or the egg?"".  Biden's DoJ dragged their heels on prosecuting Trump for a full year apparently hoping that he would just go away because they didn't want to have to prosecute a former president. It was blatantly obvious that any federal prosecution of Trump would get bogged down in the courts so waiting until last year to get them moving set up a situation where it was highly likely everything would get delayed until after this years election.  Thirdly it's ultimately the voters that are responsible for Trump. Without their support the GOP would've ditched Trump after the attempted insurrection on 6 Jan 2021.  However depending on how you look at it you could just as easily blame the Democrats for creating the situation in the first place. They were the ones who decided in the mid-1960's to splinter their White working class base by jumping into the culture wars on behalf of minority grievances and then in the late 80's-early '90's they abandoned them economically as well to serve Wall Street.  So you could just as easily say that if the Democrats had not abandoned their White working class base, who had given them all their power in the 1930's-1960's, that Trump would've never gotten anywhere near power in the first place.",A_Coup_d_etat,2024-10-07T13:33:30,2

"You could argue that the GOP isn't THE party of big business and the wealthy elite, but they're certainly still A party of big business and the wealthy elite. The GOP has had a billionaire as their presidential candidate for the past 3 elections and is getting a ton of very public support from the richest man in the world this election cycle. One of the main planks of the GOP platform is cutting a ton of regulations on businesses, as has always been the case. Both parties cater to big business and the elites to a certain extent at this point. They also both care about ""the little guy"" to a certain extent.  It's well known that the Democratic Party has seen a gradual shift in its voter demographics over a period of decades. The proportion of Democratic voters who are non-college-educated whites has been on a steady decline for more than 70 years and was overtaken by college-educated whites in 2020. As they got more support from college-educated whites, that led to more support among wealthier white-collar professionals and certain big businesses owned by those college-educated whites. That gradually changed who they catered to. They still have a lot of support from non-college-educated nonwhites as well, even more than college-educated whites, so they aren't only focused on white-collar professionals and big business, but they do tend to be more focused on issues that people living in cities care about while ignoring some rural and small town issues.  Here's a pretty good article on it: https://manhattan.institute/article/the-rise-of-college-educated-democrats  > Isn't it harder to sell the argument that the GOP doesn't care about the little guy when it seems that the only people who support him are, in fact, the little guy?

"> If we raise minimum wage that won't translate to increased costs effectively hurting the poor and middle class  It *might* increase prices, but there's a lot of caveats here.  First, in highly competitive markets, there is still pressure to keep prices low even if the input costs go up.  Second, labor is not the only input cost. Imagine for instance a business where labor is 20% of their costs (the rest is raw materials, machinery, real estate, etc). If you double the cost of labor, prices to the customer wouldn't double, it'd go up (maybe) 20%. The price of a BigMac isn't going to double because the cost of beef didn't double, the rent didn't double, cost of electricity didn't double, and so on.  >effectively hurting the poor and middle class  Let's start with the poor. They're the ones whose wages are going to go up. If you get a 50% increase to your wages but prices go up 10%, you're better off. Also, lots of your expenses would remain the same. Your rent will likely remain the same, your car payment will be the same, etc.  What about lower-income people earning above minimum wage? Their wages will also go up. Take a receptionist earning $17/hr in a place where minimum wage goes from $10 to $15. It would seem like they would get hurt if many of their expenses went up. But, increasing the minimum wage increases their bargaining power. Bargaining is based at a lot on Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement (BATNA). If the secretary's next best option is a $12/hr job, they'll have a hard time negotiating a raise because they can't credibly threaten to walk and lose 30% of their income. But after the minimum wage increase, their next best option is a $15/hr job. With an improved fallback, they're in a stronger position to negotiate a higher wage. There's a lot of research on how this stuff plays out, and iirc, the receptionist in their scenario should be able to get a $1.50 raise, and that would likely more than offset the increased prices they see.  And once the going rate for a receptionist goes from $17 to $18.50, the jobs paying $20 will also feel pressure to increase wages, but it'll be smaller, maybe just up to $20.75, and things taper off pretty quickly. The person earning $40/hr isn't going to get a raise, but they will have their expenses go up a little bit.  Should we be concerned about that? Sure. But does the harm to that person outweigh the benefit to the person who went from $10 to $15? I don't think so.",bl1y,2025-04-07T11:57:00,5

"Short answers:    Censorship:   I don't think that Harris is some amazing defender of the 1st Amendment and Free Speech, but Trump is an absolute disaster here - he has called for journalists that he doesn't like to be thrown in jail and recently demanded that CBS's broadcast license be revoked.  Harris is way better for freedom of speech.  Democracy:  Harris appears committed to maintaining the ability of the American people to vote and to my knowledge will respect the results of elections.  Trump has said that 'you won't have to vote anymore' after electing him, and after his loss in 2020 he continually claims that he won, started a smorgasbord of schemes of varying levels of legality that ultimately resulted in a mob attacking congress as they certified the election, getting several people killed.  Trump's rhetoric causes Americans to not believe that their vote matters and that there is massive election fraud which is damaging to our democracy because it isn't true.  Individual Liberty: Harris herself owns a gun and says that she won't be taking anyone's guns away, which is more or less Trump's position.  On abortion however Trump wants to take away women's individual liberty to make that choice for themselves and have their State Government make that choice for them.  Harris wins on individual liberty.  War / Diplomacy:  Harris has been involved in support for Ukraine which I believe we should continue to give (and increase, if anything).    Trump was an international catastrophe for the standing of the U.S. among nations. He cozied up to dictators like Putin and Kim Jong Un while getting into pointless fights with our NATO allies. He made wild promises like he would make Mexico 'pay for the wall' (Mexico did not). When MBS had a hit squad dismember a U.S. Resident (Kashoggi) Trump helped sweep it under the rug. He withheld military aid to Ukraine for personal reasons (turns out, military aid was really important there!) to try to get political dirt on his opponent. After the Kurds helped us by fighting and dying as our ground forces against ISIS, it took all of one phone call from Turkey for him to completely and utterly abandon the Kurds in Syria. Much like the Mexico wall thing, he has claimed that he could 'end the Ukraine war in one day', which is ludicrous on it's face and of course he won't say exactly what he would do (I assume he'd probably just abandon the Ukrainians).    Inflation:  Biden / Harris have been getting this under control.  Trump's plan for massive tariffs (which are a big tax on American companies and ultimately the American consumer) would most likely increase inflation dramatically and make it a problem again.

People aren't against Trump because of his character, that's just a false claim put forth by some on the right to pretend that the issue isn't about Trump doing lots of bad things.  Threatening the foundations of democracy seems like something that's straightforwardly bad for democracy, and its something Trump routinely does.

You listed too many topics to respond to. Here's a couple.  * Censorship: Trump collaborates with Elon Musk to censor Twitter. Musk specifically ramped up censorship on the site since his purchase. Harris hasn't done anything like this.  * War: Trump supports a Soviet Communist trying to rebuild the Soviet Union (Vladimir Putin) and Harris opposes him.,balletbeginner,2024-10-15T09:59:53,4
"Censorship: This is a legislation issue, not a presidential one. It has more to do with who's in Congress, so I don't know why you think it has anything to do with the Presidential election, and to my knowledge neither candidate has spoken extensively on it.   Voter fraud: Again, not something the President has anything to do with. The president does not run oversee or design the election, but no meaningful evidence of voter fraud in the last election was ever found. What do you expect either candidate to do on this topic?   democracy/ individual Liberty: This is an extremely broad topic, what specifically do you mean?   War/ foreign diplomacy: Trump has consistently refused to say how he will ""end wars in 24 hours."" It sounds like a ridiculous promise more than anything else. Harris has not given some unrealistic promise about bringing about world peace, but her resolutions to stand with our allies and not let powers like Russia do as they please is at the very least realistic. Trump has claimed that there were no wars while he was President, and maybe that's true, but that statement kind of exposes the flaw in his methods: he effectively threatened and bullied nations into compliance, which may be an effective short term strategy, but we're currently living in the long-term consequences. Say it works, he effectively blusters and threatens russia into withdrawing from Ukraine entirely (unlikely at this stage) what happens when his term is up? Do we have to elect another president with the exact same attitude? How long until those threats are no longer effective? After a certain point, someone will test them and then we have an actual war. Harris' strategy of continually supporting Ukraine financially keeps American soldiers from being on the frontlines, unlike in Afghanistan. Trump's ""strategy"" would make that inevitable at some point or another.   Inflation/costs: Harris has laid out plans to force companies to end price gouging, a major contributor to oversized inflation. Trump's plan is to encur tarrifs which are historically proven to increase inflation dramatically, and every major economist agrees with the assessment that while both plans drive up national debt massively, Harris' plan does so at a drastically lower rate than Trump's (to an estimated 17 trillion dollars).   Health: Trump has no plan. He said in the debate he has no plan. Harris has plans for how to reduce the cost of medicine and how to improve healthcare access.   Environment: Trump wants to roll back what enviornmental protections we have, not improve upon them. Harris largely wants to continue the ones we currently have.   Culture wars/ Racial tensions: Sadly, not something the President can directly address, but Trump's rhetoric has not helped in this at all.",[deleted],2024-10-15T09:34:49,3
"Look at it this way. If instead of Biden dropping out when he did he instead fell extremely ill to the point he was incapacitated or died. At the time he dropped out, there was literally no time to hold another nation-wide primary. If he had died, the torch would have been passed to his successor, in this case, Harris. The same would especially be true if he was elected again and then died a few days after being sworn in, Would that feel un-democratic in that sense, seeing as the president is always replaced with their VP pick in the event they cannot govern anymore? Harris was on the ticket for Joe, we nominated both of them with Harris as his replacement in the event he couldn't or didn't want to run anymore, and that's exactly what happened. There is nothing un-democratic about that in my mind. There were also no challengers regardless, she was the only one who wanted to step up after his decision was made. No up and coming Democrat would want to take that huge gamble to jump in with so little time left in the season.   No, you should not sit this election out because Trump is a convicted felon who has zero respect for our laws or institutions, and he already has shown via his actions leading up to the last election and after that he does not believe in Democracy. If you are concerned about or Democracy, then keeping him out of the white house is the number one thing we can do this election to keep it from eroding further than he's already done. 30% of the country falsely believes the last election was stolen because of him, which is a very alarming number.

"What realistic options were there after Biden withdrew?  It wasn't practical to hold another primary in such a short timeframe. Primary elections are run by state/local governments, and it's doubtful they could have been persuaded to set up and run another round of primaries just for Democrats because their frontrunner decided to drop out. The party doesn't have the capability of running their own primaries in every state.  Keep in mind that voters don't directly choose the nominee when they vote in primaries. They're actually electing delegates to represent their state at the national convention, and those delegates are the ones who actually pick the nominee. Elected delegates pledge themselves to cast their vote at the convention in a way that ""in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them,"" so if the candidate they're pledged to withdraws for some reason, then the delegates have the responsibility of using their own best judgement to cast their vote for a different candidate that they believe their voters would want. In this case, voters selected Biden with the knowledge that Harris was his VP, and given Biden's advanced age, they knew there was a very real chance that Harris would be stepping in to become President at some point. Also, Biden endorsed Harris. Both of these combined made it an easy decision for his delegates to decide how best to represent the people who elected them.",Moccus,2024-10-16T08:07:34,3

In this case, that would be picking Harris. Harris is Biden's VP, campaigned as his running mate, and was endorsed by Biden.

"> it seems like they‚Äôre doing the very thing they used to fight against: making race the defining factor in decisions  You are correct. Now not everyone or every effort to increase diversity is doing this, but it absolutely does happen.  Take Ketanji Brown Jackson. When considering who to nominate to the Supreme Court, Biden said this:  >""While I've been studying candidates' backgrounds and writings, I've made no decision except one: the person I nominate will be someone with extraordinary qualifications, character, experience and integrity - and that person will be the first Black woman ever nominated to the United States Supreme Court.""  He explicitly said that only black women would be considered to fill the vacancy left by Justice Breyer. Biden only interviewed black women for the position. This was not an instance of looking at the top people and *then* taking diversity into account. It was making race and gender prerequisites to even be considered.  Or look at the official bio for LA's fire chief:  >Creating, supporting, and promoting a culture that values diversity, inclusion, and equity while striving to meet and exceed the expectations of the communities are Chief Crowley‚Äôs priorities, and she is grateful for the opportunity to serve the City of Los Angeles.  Shouldn't it be meeting and exceeding expectations while striving to create a diverse culture?

The left absolutely screwed up in ceding debate to the right. Not ceding *a* debate, but just ceding the realm of debate.

He let's people who disagree with him jump to the front of the line. They want to deplatform him while he extends his platform to people who disagree with him.

"You lost me with your belief that DEI is about ""...making race the defining factor in decisions"". Where in the world did you get this nonsense idea? Are you watching FOX News or something?  You've got a good explanation from u/Moccus for why you're wrong, but I'll expand on that. DEI initiatives NEVER make race the single deciding factor in hiring practices. They do not advocate for hiring unqualified people (as the President and Republicans have been insisting), based on race, gender or other categories.  The idea is that when you look at your pool of qualified applicants for a position, you also look at their peers and coworkers in that job environment. Are they all white men? Are they all black women? If they are, there is likely selection bias involved in who is being hired, and a DEI program tries to balance that. And race isn't the only consideration in DEI initiatives. They also consider whether a given working environment is hiring veterans and qualified disabled people.   There's a well known story about the downtown post office in San Francisco during the 80's and 90's. There were Affirmative Action complaints filed insisting that there were discrimination patterns in their hiring, because around 80% of the people working in the building were black. None of those complaints made it to court, because the Justice Department lawyers assigned to review the hiring practices there found that white applicants were being hired as often as black candidates, by percentages. There were more black employees there, because a great deal more qualified black people were applying, than white people.   Today's DEI programs would want to figure out why there were so many more black people applying there than white, and address that (again, looking for selection bias). That's one of the reasons it's a smarter effort than the quotas set up by Affirmative Action programs.   You're always going to have an inaccurate understanding of any social issue, if you listen to the people who are opposed to it, and assume they are arguing in good faith, without examining the issue yourself. Do you believe Republicans when they say that Democrats support abortion ""Up to, and even after birth""? Do you believe Republicans who insist Democrats support LGBTQ+ rights, because they support pedophilia? Maybe listen to what the Democrats are actually advocating for, before letting their opposition define them for you.",BluesSuedeClues,2025-02-02T12:03:09,3
"> But when I look closer, it seems like they‚Äôre doing the very thing they used to fight against: making race the defining factor in decisions. Instead of fostering equality, it feels like we‚Äôre enforcing a system where opportunities are denied to some people simply because of their race  Nobody is suggesting making race the defining factor in decisions. The idea is that after you've narrowed down your pool of candidates to a small group of qualified people, then you start taking diversity into account. The first and primary factor is finding somebody who's qualified. Diversity is secondary.  The issue with just ignoring diversity completely and trying to be race/gender blind in decisions is that there are things like unconscious biases, people who get jobs due to their connections who tend to be the same race as them, women who don't feel comfortable entering certain educational programs because it's so male-dominated, etc. You can claim you're race/gender-blind and still end up with a completely white male workforce due to these factors. That's not necessarily going to correct itself.  > Censorship, deplatforming people, shutting down any opposing viewpoints‚Äîthese feel like the tactics of authoritarianism.

"That really wouldn't solve anything. It would give this world more pain, suffering, and innocent deaths while helping solve a very few select issues. Even then it wouldn't be close to what your imagining it as.   >we'll only develop medical technologies or ones that are truly necessary in everyday lives  For starters, every government and nonprofit institution would be focusing on immediate shelters, how to grow food, etc. So research organizations would automatically have less money and less resources to function off of. There would definitely be an uptick in spending to research underground food growth and that sort of thing, but medical advancements would 100% plummet. Most hospitals and doctor's offices would be rendered useless, and you can bet that the amount of surgeries, organ transfers, and studies of medical advancements would be cut to a fraction of what they were before.   When everyone is forced beneath the surface, available resources would be at an all time low leading to more violence and chaos than normal not to mention the famines and deaths from lack of medical care.  Eventually after the initial impact subsides, with billions of people dead after suffering horrible deaths, and hundreds of thousands more dying from famines and droughts underneath the surface, things would balance out into a new form of civilization. This is probably what you were imagining. The simple problem with this is that moving underground wouldn't solve any core problems of humanity. People would still fight for limited resources, be jealous, be selfish, and wealth inequality would be higher than ever. Once civilization grows large enough again, political extremism and genocides would resurface.  But maybe humanity might join forces to survive, and people would start to appreciate the small things in life.

[Here's a breakdown from ABC](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fact-checking-kamala-harris-donald-trumps-1st-presidential/story?id=113567997). One side is an actual convicted felon, and the other a normal Democrat politician. One side's just worse than the other with the truth.  4. Laws are passed through Congress. The Democrats need to control both the House and the Senate, and only controlled both for two years (2020, 2021). In that time, they actually did pass a lot of laws, but they only had a slim majority in the Senate, so the more liberal stuff was stonewalled by a few Democratic senators (which were much more conservative than the rest). The Dems also did try to pass a bipartisan border bill, but it was killed in the Senate because Trump wanted to keep the border an issue for the election, and his Republican allies in Congress followed suit.   5. More number? If you're talking about stuff like ""millions of illegal immigrants coming through the border"", then he used more numbers cause he made it up on the spot.   6. She plans to undo most of the Trump Tax Cut of 2018, which lowered the corporate tax rate and the general tax rate, including the top 1% of earners, reducing federal revenue and adding $4.6 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years. [Harris wants to raise the corporate tax and tax on $400,000+ households to pay for all the stuff she's suggesting.](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/27/trump-harris-tax-cuts-00175441)  7. Idk, that's the network's choice.  8. The unemployment rate now under Biden (4.2%) lowered from its high point during the mid-2020 COVID recession (14%). He also gave stimulus checks during that time of crazy unemployment. The world's still recovering from COVID, which fucked up the global economy. Add a war in Ukraine, a major food producer and Houthis attacking supply routes, and yeah, grocery prices are higher. [The US though recovered much better compared to other countries. ](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68203820)   9. Use Ground News if you wanna see an aggregate of all networks and their headlines. IMO the way the media can lead is how they can *spin* the truth, not on whether something actually happened or not.   Look, I know it seems like Trump's comically incompetent to Kamala, but we're used to people from both sides being somewhat in the same realm of sanity. This ain't the case anymore. The media isn't painting Trump to be an idiot, no one forced him to say the pet-eating line*.* People attack him by *simply quoting him back*. He said he lost the 2020 election ""by a whisker"" in an interview then claimed he was sarcastic a few days later. He is an actual criminal felon, convicted by a jury. Efforts to try and make Trump more reasonable and equal to Kamala honestly isn't really based on reality.   Way I see it, the guy who was complicit in an attempt to overthrow the government is more likely to be a liar than the entire media apparatus having a conspiracy to pull him down.",MehEds,2024-09-11T20:55:58,8
"> The moderator fact checked Trump, but not Kamala. That's objectively not fair.  It's only objectively not fair if they were both lying at a similar level. If Kamala wasn't lying, then there's nothing for them to fact check her on.  > They should fact check both of them. Why did they only do Trump?  Because Trump was the only one spouting off things that were obvious lies, like the idea that Haitian immigrants are eating cats and dogs, or that he won the 2020 election.  > Why hasn't Kamala done anything she claims she will do?  She has the power to do what she says she will do now, but hasn't done it yet. Why?  Because as VP, she doesn't have any real power, so no, she doesn't have any ability to do it now.  > But where will the money she says she will give these people come from?  She would probably say that it will come from tax increases on the wealthy, but more than likely it will come from the same place as the money that replaced the revenue that was lost from Trump's tax cuts, i.e. additional government debt.  > Prices of everything were lower (in my experience) when Trump was in office compared to Biden.  Prices tend to rise over time on average because the Federal Reserve targets slightly positive inflation. It would be odd and likely concerning if they were lower under Biden than they were under Trump. It would indicate a severe economic recession had occurred, so people probably wouldn't be pleased about the situation.  > Kamala claims it was the opposite.  Source?  > Who in the Biden economy is benefiting from him?  Real wages have gone up significantly for the lowest-wage workers over the past few years, outpacing the rise in prices. It's the middle who has mostly been hurt because they just get the cost of living increases that don't outpace inflation, and they don't have enough investments to benefit from the rise in the stock market.  > I'm from a low-income house, so does that mean rich people benefit from a democratic economy?  The rich find ways to benefit from the economy no matter who's in charge.  > Where can I go to find the truth? I don't know who is actually telling it?  Look at a lot of sources, preferably high quality sources like academic journals and raw data. Read them. Learn to understand them. Identify the discrepancies and figure out why different sources say different things. Draw your own conclusions. This takes time and effort, but it will get you to some semblance of the truth, and you'll start to notice when the media and/or politicians are omitting context and twisting facts.",Moccus,2024-09-11T20:16:07,5
"> Why were a bunch of the questions directed at trump so specific and had negative underlying tones?  A few things. One is just that Trump has said a lot more bizarre and troubling things; he and Harris weren't at all on equal footing in those regards. Another is likely bias form the moderators.  >Why did Trump make such a weird claim about how immigrants were eating people pets.  Because it's been on social media and probably some conservative news outlets and he didn't bother to find out if it was true (there's no evidence that it is). He should have just stuck to the impact of our high immigration numbers. Springfield, OH is a city of 60,000 with 15,000 Haitian immigrants who arrived just in the past couple year.  >The moderator fact checked Trump, but not Kamala.  Because Trump says more outrageous stuff and things that are more easily called out as obviously untrue. Harris also had her share of untrue statements, but they're less outrageous and more difficult to parse. She should have been called out for the ""fine people on both sides"" and ""bloodbath"" comments though as both were obviously mischaracterized and that fact is well known to the moderators.  >Why hasn't Kamala done anything she claims she will do? She has the power to do what she says she will do now, but hasn't done it yet. Why?  Harris herself has very little power. But, Trump really should have brought up that point at the start, not in his closing remarks. Then just reframe it as ""why hasn't *your administration* done this?"" rather than specifically Harris doing it, to avoid the quibble over Harris not being President, but she is the #2 in the administration.  >Why did Trump use more number when talking and Kamala didn't?  Trump likes numbers more, and likes saying bigger and bigger numbers. 21 million, but probably even more than that! Harris tends to avoid specifics, I think because she hasn't developed a lot of clear policy goals and she likely didn't want to get bogged down in details during the debate.  >But where will the money she says she will give these people come from?  Same as every Democratic proposal, taxing the wealthy. But I don't think she's broken down the numbers anywhere. And FYI, the money for small businesses would end up being very little. It's a tax break, so it would only end up going to share of small businesses that actually turn a profit and wouldn't help those struggling to reach that point.  >Why did the woman moderator have way fewer questions than the guy?  Who knows. They may have divided up their duties, such as one focusing on asking questions and one focusing on taking notes. We don't really know though.  >Prices of everything were lower (in my experience) when Trump was in office compared to Biden. Kamala claims it was the opposite.  I don't think Harris ever claimed prices were higher under Trump than under Biden.  >Who in the Biden economy is benefiting from him?  Unemployment is low and the stock market is booming. So, people who would otherwise be unemployed are benefitting, and so is anyone with investments in the market (and this includes things like retirement savings, so it's a lot of people).  >Where can I go to find the truth?  That's going to vary based on the specific thing you want to know about.",bl1y,2024-09-12T09:44:50,3
"lot of good responses, but want to add that Trump just makes up inflated numbers.

US has given 100 billion and Europe has collectively given 180 billions. Also the US gave a lot of obsolete stuff like Bradley fight vehicles which were mostly already retired; giving them away saved us the disposal cost and put them to good use.  earlier in the day (not at the debate) Trump said Kamala was letting in 100's of millions of illegals into the country.

"> why would anyone be genuinely opposed to deporting someone for murder, rape, or assault with serious injury?  Well for one thing, it applies to anybody **arrested** for any of those crimes listed. Being arrested for a crime doesn't necessarily mean you're guilty of that crime. Imagine getting arrested for an assault that you didn't commit and then getting deported on top of that. If they actually committed a serious crime, then they'll eventually end up in prison anyways when they get convicted, and ICE can come get them at their leisure.

Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland are all countries with substantial socialist programs, a high level of personal freedom and a high quality standard of living.

By most standards they would be considered ""left"".   A better divide in assessing how well a country runs (focusing on the quality of living of its citizens) is looking at whether it is run democratically (including republics) or as an authoritarian state. Those countries of ""latin america"" you refer to, may be ""left"", but they're run by authoritarian governments.

"The way the primary works is that if you win a state's primary, you get a certain amount of delegates pledged to vote for you. The number of delegates is proportionate to the state's population, so California will get more than Rhode Island. These delegates then vote at the convention for the nominee.   So when Biden won these states' primaries, the delegates' votes were pledged to Biden. When he dropped out, that means that these delegates' votes were now unpledged, and hypothetically, they could support anyone. The party, though, obviously wanted to avoid a chaotic, divisive situation where everybody was fighting over the nominee at the convention--and the delegates tend to be faithful party members who don't want that either. So two things happened--first, Joe Biden endorsed Kamala Harris and said he wanted her to be the nominee, and second, Harris started calling up the state delegations to see if they would be willing to vote for her instead of Biden. Once enough states said they would transfer their votes from Biden to her, then she became the de facto nominee.  It would obviously be better if there had been a chance for voters to vote again--but primaries are a lengthy, expensive process, and had already occurred once this year. There was just no way to arrange anything like that again in just a month. And in such a short time period to campaign, Harris would have ended up the nominee anyway--she had a huge advantage in name recognition (and money), and it would have taken another candidate months to build a campaign that could compete with that.",anneoftheisland,2024-08-24T14:42:20,5

"First, there's a very high bar to prove treason. The Constitution states that ""Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort."" The term ""enemies"" as used in the Constitution is understood to apply ""only to the subjects of a foreign power in a state of open hostility"" with the United States. If that definition applies to any illegal immigrants, it's not many, and like most crimes, treason requires intent. Unless you can show beyond a reasonable doubt that an executive order was created with the intent to help some subjects of a foreign power we're at war with get into the country more easily, then treason isn't going to apply.  Second, there are no executive orders that specifically allow illegal migrants into the country. Illegal migrants are coming in regardless of any executive orders that exist. The only thing executive orders do is set priorities for enforcement, which is a recognized power of the executive branch of government (known as prosecutorial discretion). Law enforcement resources are finite and will never be able to catch and prosecute every criminal out there. The police could spend all of their time trying to catch every jaywalker, but that would take resources away from enforcement of other far more serious crimes. It's the same with illegal immigration. We could devote all of our resources to catching every illegal immigrant who was brought here as a child through no fault of their own, grew up here, is fully integrated with our society, etc., but that would take away resources from going after illegal immigrants who are here to commit crimes via gang or drug cartel activity.",Moccus,2024-06-24T19:39:07,5

This would be completely uncharted territory, but if (and that's a big if) the referees of the convention, whoever they might be (whether the SC or some state delegates) act in good faith, it will be intentionally separate from control of either Congress or the President.  I think the most likely (and probably intended by the framers) CC scenario is a (worse, and perhaps ultimate) version of the direction we're going today: a Federal government tyranny, with broken checks and balances, and the oligarchy in control of Congress refusing to allow a normal Amendment process.   Presumably, if it got so bad as to need a CC, there is already a severe constitutional crisis, and a CC would be a last-ditch attempt to avoid either a civil war, secessions, or the US simply dissolving itself.

Since Hillary had tied herself to Bill's presidency as an argument for her experience she also tied herself to NAFTA.  2- People were still extremely pissed at the establishment for how the 2008 financial crises was handled and wanted change. Clinton was basically the most establishment candidate around and people were willing to give an outsider (Trump) a chance and hope that maybe that would better than the establishment duopoly.  3- The 20 years between 1996 (Bill's re-election) and 2016 had massive cultural change.

That's all degrees, so it includes English Literature and Petroleum Engineering, and the advanced degrees includes Master's, PhDs, Law, MBAs, etc.  I've heard people cite teachers as underpaid relative to other Master's degree holders, but I haven't seen the data broken out by the degree. And I hate to say it, but Education programs are notoriously not that rigorous, so it's very hard to draw comparisons.  But all that said, the prevailing narrative of teachers being paid scraps just generally isn't true. Newer elementary school teachers in rural areas do get paid very little, but the norm is that it's a good paying job, about 50% more than the average American earns.",bl1y,2025-02-11T11:53:51,1
">I think it needs to be pointed out that Teachers work 180 days a year vs the typical employee who works 260 days a year  You've out kicked the coverage a bit on this one. Just to begin, the typical employee doesn't work 260 days; it's closer to 240-245 (holidays and vacation). Also, teachers do work during those breaks, so the number of days they're on payroll doesn't capture the full amount of time worked.  As for the equivalent annual salary, earning the equivalent of some number is miles away from having that amount land in your bank account.

"It's the same reason a lot of people voted for/like Trump.

The constant lies also, in a way, help Fox by isolating them from other cable networks. They get to claim they're under attack by the corrupt monolith of the mainstream, meaning that people who watch and listen to them feel like individualistic free thinkers. Individualism is a big part of the Republican/conservative/right-leaning mindset, so this again reinforces their respect for Fox.   It's really easy to say ""they just want to be lied to,"" cause it is, in part, true, but the unfortunate reality is, having larger and larger amounts of well articulated proof, published by very old news institutions, backed by evidence researched at even older universities is not going to win over people who have constantly felt like rich people have been hoodwinking them forever.

"Yeah, Biden's age has been his number one liability as a candidate the entire time.

That's baked into his polling numbers already. The (over)reaction to the debate on Thursday seemed predicated on people thinking there are a substantial number of voters out there that didn't realize Biden was old until the debate, and that's just not true. Almost everybody knows he's old, and most of them have already decided that either they won't vote for him because of that or will anyway. The debate isn't going to move the numbers much on that, because there are just not that many voters left to move.  To answer the OP's question, of course people who are going to vote for Biden are finding ways to psychologically justify it to themselves. And Biden's campaign and the Democratic Party and their surrogates are certainly being enlisted to counteract the narrative right now. But also, the reaction to the debate on Thursday night was incredibly hyperbolic, and was always going to be walked back. The reaction to a disastrous debate was always going to be that he'd get a lot of extra media attention at his next few weeks' of appearances, he'd probably perform fine there (especially because unlike at the debate, he has a teleprompter), they'll give us some PR appearances where he's working out or speaking directly about some complicated topic.

"I really don‚Äôt think of my questions as rhetorical. They‚Äôre real questions for Democrats.

So I‚Äôm asking, if the stakes are so high, why are we putting forward a deeply unpopular, 82-year old man who, charitably, has good days and bad days? Less charitably, a candidate on the door of death?  I‚Äôm less worried about convincing liberals to vote for Biden. Trump is obviously not a serious alternative. What I would be worried about for the Dems is depressed voter turn out, undecideds, Republican-lites who were open to voting for the ‚Äústable‚Äù adult, and minority voters who may have traditionally had an affinity toward the Dem party but whose social or economic views have dovetailed.

Like you said, she is even more unpopular than Biden and will inspire no one to come out and vote for her.  2) I think the fear that Harris is getting ‚Äúpassed over‚Äù is overblown and unserious. Surely we‚Äôre not still doing checkbox politics in 2024. If Harris were the best choice to take on Trump, it would be her. She‚Äôs not. Whoever is the best choice, the Democrat base will fall in line behind. We‚Äôre not worried about the base. We‚Äôre worried about the folks who may not turn out and the folks who want a Trump alternative but don‚Äôt want Biden. If the base won‚Äôt turn out because choice A is not as good as choice B, maybe all that talk about voting in a corpse over Trump was a whole lot of hot air.   3) any scenario where it‚Äôs not Biden involves his participation in stepping down. There is no mechanism to force him out, but the idea is folks would appeal to his sense of country over self. It may be messy. I think a lot less messy than skeptics of this idea.

That's why even though the rest of the Dems had been waiting for 8 years to get their chance no one of any note ran against Clinton. Furthermore when Sanders (who they thought would be no challenge) ended up being a threat the DNC ran around doing whatever they could to help Hillary including having Clyburn tell the Blacks that they had to vote for her and giving Hillary all the questions for their debate ahead of time.  In 2020 there was no outcry by the voters that they needed Biden but he was the pick by the gerontocracy that controls the Democratic Party. They ran around helping him as much as they could and as soon as he got a slight lead in the primaries they pressured everyone to drop out ""because of Covid"".  The Democrats are a hierarchical party that believes that only people who have waited around and paid their dues should be allowed to run for president and they do whatever they can to enforce that regardless of what the public wants.",A_Coup_d_etat,2024-06-29T11:36:15,-2

So now suppose Congress passes a law criminalizing some action by the President, but the Constitution authorizes the President to take that action. Who wins? Again, the Constitution is supreme over the statutes. Congress can't criminalize something authorized by the Constitution because the Constitution is the superior law.

"While I cannot say the same when it comes to who I am voting for, there seems to be a lot of truth when it comes to the benefit of the middle class under democratic administrations. I am trying to understand this better, so if you can elaborate, I would appreciate that.   Historically, republicans have been big on the 'trickle-down economics' thing. However, I understand that this concept does not actually work, and instead of the top CEOs taking the money from these tax cuts and bettering the national economy in the form of investing in other businesses, or making new jobs for their own company, they simply send it overseas to tax havens to have that money avoid being taxed at American rates.   With this being said, would I be right to say that the top earners ought to be taxed more, and the middle class be taxed less...? From how I see it, this would give Americans a plentiful amount of disposable income to invest in the economy, while also maintaining similar standards of social services. Piggybacking off of this question, is this POV more of a democratic one? I am not too knowledgeable on their perspective of the domestic economy, broadly speaking.   To wrap all of this up... if the average American would benefit more as a result of higher taxes on the top 1%, and Trump's tax policy actually reduces taxes on the top 1%, would this mean that Trump is a president for the rich, whereas Harris is a president for the middle class (strictly speaking economics-wise)?",Simple-Albatross3089,2024-10-14T10:46:52,2

"Tarriffs do not work like that and most economists agree they are not good policy. All imported goods will go up in price and that price increase gets passed on to the consumer.

Illegal immigrants do not receive social benefits, they do not receive many of the benefits of citizenship yet they still pay into taxes. Illegal immigrants also keep prices down because they take the jobs that normal citizens will not take. Trump himself employs illegal immigrants, so talk about hypocrisy. Expect insane prices increases if every illegal gets deported out of this country. Speaking of which, we still don't know how Trump is going to cleanly deport every single illegal. You're going to have cops going door to door trying to weed out millions of migrants and many innocent people WILL get caught up in that.

"In Neal Stephenson‚Äôs The System of the World series, quicksilver serves as a rich metaphor and symbol that ties into the book‚Äôs central themes of transformation, alchemy, and the intersection of science and philosophy in the early Enlightenment period.  Quicksilver, an old name for mercury, represents fluidity, transformation, and the transitional nature of knowledge and society during the time. Mercury was central to alchemical practices, where it symbolized the mutable essence of matter, as well as being associated with change and communication in mythology (e.g., the Roman god Mercury).  In the context of Stephenson‚Äôs series: 	1.	Transformation and Discovery: The Enlightenment era was a time of rapid scientific progress, intellectual upheaval, and societal change. Quicksilver mirrors this fluid, unstable environment where ideas and beliefs were constantly in flux. 	2.	Philosophical Dualities: Like mercury‚Äôs liquid and metallic properties, the series explores dualities‚Äîalchemy vs. science, old systems vs. new ones, reason vs. faith. 	3.	Newton and Alchemy: Isaac Newton, a key figure in the series, was both a scientist and an alchemist. His obsession with mercury in his alchemical studies ties directly to the metaphorical and literal presence of quicksilver throughout the narrative.  Thus, quicksilver is not just a substance in the story but a symbol of the world shifting from old, mystical ways of understanding to new, empirical ones. It represents the slippery, ever-changing nature of truth and progress during that historical moment.",Simple_Post_1850,2025-01-24T21:14:21,1

"In terms of personal power, I think that (by far) biggest thing Trump wants to get done (at least out of the things he *could* accomplish), is to get the Supreme Court to strike down the Pendleton Civil Service Act as ""unconstitutionally"" restricting Presidential power, under the ""Unitary Executive Theory."" Essentially, rule that the Vesting Clause of the US Constitution gives the President sole power over the Executive (except when the Constitution says otherwise, such as needing Senate confirmations for Cabinet members.) Which, Cabinet aside, includes the Presidential power to hire and fire any military or civil service worker he wants, based on the criteria only he chooses (e.g. perceived loyalty), rather than any objective merit or following any system enacted by Congress, and not restricted in that matter by any other Congressional laws, either (e.g. the Civil Rights Act), under the same argument that no statutory law can abridge a power the President has been directly granted by the Constitution.  This would destroy the modern American bureaucratic state, which would allow Trump and his cronies to rebuild it in their image. To him, it's exactly the ""drain the swamp"" he promised. The fact the Federal government is irrepairably damaged as a result, to him, is a feature, not a bug. His supporters want a return to the States' Compact Theory (where the Federal government is powerless to enforce civil rights or anything else in individiual states against their will), and this is the closest they can get to it. They know they can't *formally* get individual states to have the right to nullify Federal law, so their goal is to simply make the Fed be too weak to enforce it, especially in areas of civil and human rights.  This is why Trump fired those 18 inspectors so quick. He knew it was blatantly against the law, but he wants it to go through the courts and get that law stricken down. And given the SC has just ruled the President has absolute immunity for Constitutional powers, there's a good chance he'll win, which will be the biggest change in American internal governance since 1883, and not for the better.",GeneReddit123,2025-01-29T16:18:21,2

It did streamline and reduce Federal red-tape to get that vaccine (and subsequent ones) into the population faster, but under those circumstances, I suspect any administration would have done the exact same thing.   Giving him credit for vaccine development feels a bit like giving him credit for not starting a nuclear war and insisting that made his time in office a peaceful Presidency. And this seems to be a very consistent bias in dealing with Donald Trump, that he's often so outrageous in his speech and actions, that anything he does that isn't objectively horrible, is treated as some kind of accomplishment. I understand OP's desire to try to assess and compare positive accomplishments of the two administrations, but saying Trump's ""Operation Warp Speed"" was a positive accomplishment, ignores the simple reality that his COVID response was, in aggregate, phenomenally horrible (I won't bother to list all the reasons why, unless specifically asked, out of respect for OP's intent).",BluesSuedeClues,2024-10-10T12:20:26,3

SS taxes are applicable to all earned income, excl. capital gains, so idk why you're acting like billionaires are not subject to SS.  let's assume the average american makes $100k/yr, and assume effective tax rate is 20% (obviously both of these numbers are inflated to support the leftist argument). all $100k is subject to SS taxes, so the total effective tax rate is 26%, so the average american pays $26k in federal taxes per year.  in order to exceed the raw amount on long term capital gains (we're using long term instead of short term because, again, it favors the leftist argument), a billionaire would have to liquidate an amount that would yield more than 26k/0.02 = 130k in gains. at 10% annualized returns, that's about liquidating 1.3m in assets, which is multiple orders of magnitude less than what occurs in reality, so billionaires pay far more in federal taxes per year at a raw amount (admittedly, whether or not you want to compare raw amounts or rates is a separate argument, however). i'm not even including the other taxes that are paid here  also stocks are paper money unless it's liquidated, so i really have no clue what you're even getting at. if you don't liquidate, you don't pay capital gains tax, whether you're a billionaire holding 1million shares of S&P500 or a homeless guy     the point is that blanket misleading comments like """"Billionaires pay less taxes than I, an average working class person, do"" are asinine",DepartmentVarious977,2024-09-25T08:51:08,-1

"Completely right about the declining role of TV news.  Harris's interview on Fox drew about 8 million views live and another 6.6 on YouTube.

The top show on a news network is Fox News's The Five, which gets just under 3 million. Ben Shapiro's daily show tends to get 300-500k, which is about half of CNN's top show (Anderson Cooper). Smaller numbers, but Daily Wire has been around only 9 years compared to CNN's 44, and has about 100 employees compared to the several thousand at CNN.

It's not a fair comparison, especially because her district includes more of Queens now, which is slightly more red. To put all that into context, Democrats won about 66% of the statewide vote in 2018 in NY, and just 55% in 2024, which alone explains the shift. She also outran Harris and Biden in her seat.

"Thanks so much for giving this clear answer üëçüèº. I have follow up questions/things to state for further discussion  1.) I agree they‚Äôre going in fast and furious lol and while that may look or even be undesirable by most, I think that simply is a product of his personality. Those who like and prize themselves on efficiency tend to try to get things done as quickly as possible to maximize their time, especially because they only have a year and a half to get this done and I‚Äôm not sure what all their department is tasked with so I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôre being speedy simply because they are able to and because they like it or if it‚Äôs due to a time constraint. I‚Äôm not saying that‚Äôs good or bad, I just think it might be what they‚Äôre doing. Additionally I was a bit confused because I looked it up and some places seem to say that through executive order, a president can state where the funds should and shouldn‚Äôt go depending on the president‚Äôs general agenda, however I also saw things saying he needs Congress approval for this so I‚Äôm not entirely sure which one is correct.   2.) I do think there‚Äôs some things USAID uses their funds for genuine good and helpful things, but I do think other things were simply directed towards because it‚Äôs what the previous presidents agenda and desires were. Some members of Congress were even saying THEY weren‚Äôt aware this is where the funds were going which sounds to me like Congress DOESTN get a say in where the money goes and if that‚Äôs the case, then I‚Äôm not sure that Donald Trump withdrawing those funds and directing them elsewhere according to his agenda is illegal or unconstitutional either since Biden seemed to do the same.   3.) I‚Äôll try to cut this shorter than it is and address the other points here. The bunch of kids things I understand but at the same time I don‚Äôt think age or degree always determines one‚Äôs intelligence or ability to do something. Privacy I also understand, however, tons of people we aren‚Äôt even aware of have access to our private info in government and nobody seems to care about that so that one seems hypocritical ü§∑üèª.

"You don't need to be left-wing to acknowledge that the present US Federal leadership is dangerously close to *at least* populist authoritarianism, disregard for precedent, the rule of law (both domestic and international), rejection of political pluralism, appeal to fear, singling out 'hostile' or 'guilty' groups for our current misfortunes, or even common decency and decorum expected of career politicians, at least those in Western democracies. These all bear the hallmarks of proto-fascism.  None of this was even close to the present state under any past administration (not even the 2016 Trump.) The closest is probably Andrew Jackson, but the 'fascism' label is simply inapplicable in pre-industrial times, so we cannot draw a fair comparison.  And I say this as someone who historically disliked the Left calling all kinds of things they don't like as fascist. Because now, when we are close to actual fascism, a lot of people (especially outside the US) think we're crying wolf.  For what it's worth, I don't think the highly decentralized US political system would allow a full-blown fascist regime to emerge in the styles of Germany, Italy, or Spain, not even if all three branches of Federal government collude to try and make it happen. But the current regime, in its proto-fascist state, can still do enormous damage at home and abroad. I think the most likely outcome of Trumpism is a (worse, but still limited) version of McCarthyism: a right-wing moral panic that sweeps the nation in search for invisible ""enemies"", and lasts a few years to a decade, until one day we sober up and realize how many stupid things were done and how long will the road to recovery be. All of this (assuming Elonald Mump get their way to demolish the US government, and massively withdraw US presence worldwide) would coincide with a recession the size of the Great Depression.  I believe America will, *eventually*, survive and overcome this. Our country is too strong and diverse to die to essentially an outsized moral panic.

"The claim that this is just a battle between ""two shitty world powers"" oversimplifies the situation. Ukraine is not a helpless pawn‚Äîit is actively resisting Russian imperialism. The war did not start because of ""U.S. escalation""‚ÄîRussia invaded before the U.S. even sent military aid. The simplest solution is for Russia to stop its invasion, not for the U.S. to abandon Ukraine.   So most of what you stated is false or very misleading. Falls under heavy conspiracy theory territory:    ""Ukraine is an extremely corrupt Eastern European state..."" -Partially true but misleading: Ukraine has had corruption issues, but it has actively worked to address them, especially since 2014. According to Transparency International, Ukraine's Corruption Perceptions Index has been improving. -False: Ukraine does want to become part of the West. The 2013‚Äì2014 Euromaidan protests happened because Ukrainians wanted to integrate with the EU. Polls consistently show a majority supporting EU and NATO membership.   ""Ukraine is highly xenophobic and bigoted..."" -Mostly false: Ukraine has far-right elements, but so do many countries. It has a Jewish president (Zelenskyy) and has cracked down on extremists. The claim that it is becoming a ""Christian Nationalist"" state is baseless.  ""The U.S. provoked Russia into armed conflict..."" -False: The main reason for Russia's aggression is its own imperial ambitions. Ukraine isn‚Äôt ""stuck in the middle""‚Äîit actively chose to align with Western institutions. -NATO never ""promised"" not to expand‚Äîno formal agreement existed. Eastern European nations voluntarily sought NATO membership for security.  ""The U.S. blocked Russia from the WTO for 19 years..."" -False: Russia was admitted to the WTO in 2012. Its delay was due to its own non-compliance with international trade rules.  ""Biden threatened Ukraine to benefit U.S. gas interests..."" False and misleading:  -Biden pushed for the removal of corrupt Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin, in line with U.S. and EU anti-corruption policies‚Äînot for U.S. gas interests. -The claim that the U.S. forced Ukraine to cut Russian gas subsidies is misleading. Ukraine was reducing reliance on Russian energy for national security reasons.  ""Euromaidan was a U.S.-backed coup..."" False: Euromaidan was a grassroots movement, not a U.S.-engineered coup. The protests began when President Yanukovych rejected an EU agreement in favor of closer ties with Russia. No credible evidence exists of CIA orchestration.  ""CIA backed neo-Nazi groups like Azov and Right Sector..."" Misleading:  -The Azov Battalion had far-right origins but was later integrated into Ukraine's National Guard and depoliticized. -There‚Äôs no evidence of U.S. intelligence agencies supporting these groups.  ""Crimea voted for independence because of an illegal coup..."" -False:  -The 2014 Crimea referendum was held under Russian military occupation, with no independent monitoring, and was not internationally recognized. -Russia violated the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, where it had pledged to respect Ukraine‚Äôs territorial integrity.  ""Ukraine banned minorities from fleeing at the start of the war..."" Exaggerated:  -There were reports of discrimination against African and Indian students early in the war, but the Ukrainian government condemned this. The broader claim that minorities were ""banned"" is false.  ""Zelenskyy banned all leftist parties and independent media..."" Misleading:  -Ukraine did ban parties with direct ties to Russia‚Äôs invasion, but not general leftist or progressive parties. -Media was consolidated for national security, but independent journalism still exists.   ""The U.S. bombed the Nord Stream pipeline..."" -Unproven conspiracy theory:  -There is no definitive proof that the U.S. bombed Nord Stream. Investigations are ongoing, and multiple actors had potential motives.   ""The U.S. wants control over Ukraine‚Äôs resources..."" False:  -The U.S. has provided billions in aid to Ukraine without extracting resources. -The idea that the U.S. engineered the war for resource control lacks evidence.",epichesgonnapuke,2025-03-05T18:27:14,1

"Immunity would probably flow through to executive department officials.  The basic idea is that if the Constitution gives the President power, there's no higher law that can criminalize it. But surely the President isn't required to be the sole actor in exercising that power. Can't prosecute him for giving a pardon, but can prosecute the prison warden who releases the prisoner? It would be an exception that swallows the rule.  But otherwise, I think your comment is on the mark. People have grossly misunderstood the opinion. It's not ""if you shout 'official act' you're immune from prosecution"" as so many seem to think.  There's some totally backwards reasoning going on. The President gets immunity for things that are within his official power. Then people imagine scenarios like the above wiretapping an entire town. For him to get immunity for that, people would have to think that (before the recent opinion) wiretapping an entire town was already part of his official powers.

">1: bias exist, also polling is inherently erronious compared to the entire election. An entire election is the sum of all the anecdotal opinion, or personal opinion. The polls are trying to capture that with 500 or 1000 people, each. That's just the way it is, and it's never perfect.  That I already agreed on that.  >2: Trump has a lot of total EVs locked up due to the way small states vs big stats favor him more. There are states evidence to the contrary, but it is the general that it favors republicans. There are a slew of states that favor kamala each, individually, but the chances she wins all of them are small. Pennsylvania is the most likely tipping point state, but something could happe in another state where she still loses even if she wins PA.  Yeah, there are too many red republicans states that remain unchanged and blue democratic states that remain unchanged as well, so let's pray that two swing States would make Kamala president if not well it proves Trump is always popular because of his luck and popularity but hated by democrats, liberals and the middle politics.  Also, its likely that no women becomes the president of America.  >   3: According to nate silver, 538, and various others, it's about 50/50, 48/52, 52/48 on any given day, given their imperfect science of polling.  >  Probably the tight polls as mentioned  >   4.Unlikely.  Maybe  >   5.2016 maybe, but certainly not the 1968 election. There is not expected to be any 3rd party candidate this year to upset and take a whole region like wallace did to the south.  True though I still feel like its 1968 all over again, because Biden like LBJ decided not to reelect leaving  	Hubert Humphrey as candidate instead like Kamala and like Kamala he is popular to the polls early in the campaign but later declined and then lost the election making Nixon the Victor and even with or without a third party the 2024 election likely a mixture of the 1968 and 2016 election with Trump winning and Kamala losing.  Also back in 2016, we though Trump will not win, but surprisingly he won and this year since many think Kamala will lose most people fear and  expect that Trump is winning.   >   7: The potential is still there, but it's likely to die down if we don't get another disingenous republican candidate. Only time will tell.  Good point on that     >6: The recipe for violence is already there, but Trump stirs it by suggesting there's an uncontrollable deep state, or the Dems are controlling this, and that, and we¬†*need*¬†to stop them. There's always animosity from liberal to conservative and vice versa, riots against police action, which is not to be confused with political violence. Jan 6th was political violence. Riots after police activity is political in nature, but it's not politically charged to begin with. It's basic rights to begin with, which makes it different as one comes from a definitive misdeed. The other comes from a perceived misdeed that a cult of personality has projected.  Yeah, with trumps attitude not moving on after his loss (including his supporters) it's no wonder he still gets the nomination to be the main candidate for the republican candidate especially that he defeated his rivals, if he loses or won (the latter I think if  he should no longer elect for another term in 2028 if he accepts his age) he should let another republican candidate win the presidency for the party.

">1.Many polls have certain political leanings and biases.  That is true because various websites with polls are different  >2.Trump is polling better as he's accessing and activating different subgroups that traditionally haven't voted, and Harris is not a popular incumbent candidate. He also has more paths to victory than she does.   3.Chances are 60l/40w ‚Äì She selected Walz which may help her ice out Trump in the Northern States. However, he needs just ‚Äîone‚Äî of 3 states. And he's leading all the polls. So, unless she sweeps, she loses the election.  That could be true and from my perspective there is a reason why Trump is polling better because he is still popular to his supporters and some undecided voters because of his previous presidency and that he improved the economy because he was a businessman.  And here is a reason why  Harris is not a popular incumbent candidate. For few  reasons  * Most Americans are unhappy  with Biden's term, especially that recent conflicts started to appear because during trumps reign there are no Russia and Israel wars. And Kamala is a vice president of Biden, which is why most Americans don't want Kamala as president * The reason why Trump is always the main nominee for the Republican Party is that Trump has a no defeat attitude and doesn't let go and move on, the same with  his supporters, and he wants to reclaim his presidency and because he has easily beaten his republic opponents to get the main nominee and still has his loyal supporters especially that most Americans are unhappy with both parties instead of a multi party like most countries which is the reason Trump is always the main nominee for the republic party and why most people want the Republican Party to win. * Trump can easily beat a female candidate except Biden because he is male, and he will likely beat Kamala like he did to Hilary back in 2016, he lost to Biden because most people are tired of Trump. * Oh and one more reason, Trump's Teflon luck, his luck helps him gain what he wants and whenever he ends up in difficult or worse situations, his luck always saves him and will likely help him regain his presidency.  >5.2016 maybe  That could be  another reason, but for me, it's like a repeat of both 1968 and 2016 election because you see in 1968 Lyndon B. Johnson announce that he will not seek reelection due to the Vietnam War pressure  so Hubert Humphrey (Johnson's vice president)  became the democratic nominee instead and like Kamala he gains a surge in polls in the early weeks of the election  but in the final weeks his polls are declining and comparing the situations between 1968 and 2024 that involve conflicts like the Vietnam War in 1968 and the ongoing multi conflicts in the world that will lead to world war 3 like the Israel war, Ukraine war and the upcoming China-Taiwan war then it's possible that like Nixon, Trump  will regain his presidency while Kamala like Hubert will lose.  Also, there could be three reasons why Kamala will likely lose the 2024 election (along with trump) but this link from politico will explain both the candidate's 3 weakness [https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/10/25/2024-elections-live-coverage-updates-analysis/polling-update-00185644](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/10/25/2024-elections-live-coverage-updates-analysis/polling-update-00185644)",trover2345325,2024-10-27T00:52:17,2

"(Not the OP)  The usual narrative around these parts about the Supreme Court is that their rulings stalled the trials and kept Trump out of prison, and if he were in prison he'd lose the election.  >I understand that after that point, he'll be able to do basically whatever he wants should he win  You understand incorrectly, assuming you're talking about the immunity decision.  There's a false narrative about the decision which basically says that so long as Trump does something while wearing the Official Acts Hat, he can't be prosecuted.  The actual decision goes something like this: There are things the Constitution gives the President the power to do, and things statutes give the President the power to do. He has total protection in exercising his Constitutional powers because no criminal statute can trump the Constitution. He has near-total immunity when exercising powers Congress has given him, because presumably Congress didn't empower him to do things they would then have him imprisoned for doing. He has no immunity for things that don't fall under either category.  If the President ordered the military to shoot all the Democrats, he would not have immunity even if he shouted ""official act!"" the whole time. The Constitution makes him commander-in-chief, but he has no power to tell the military to murder American citizens.  Here's the simple way to think about it: Take whatever crazy action you're worried about and ask yourself ""Is Biden *legally* allowed to do this?"" If so, then he can't be prosecuted for something he's *legally allowed to do.*",bl1y,2024-10-27T07:14:22,2

I mean, Garland most definitely deserves blame as well if Trump wins, but in my view, I'm blaming SCOTUS more because one, had they not interfered, Trump's trial would've still happened before the election even with Garland's unnecessary delay, and two, SCOTUS is at the top of the judiciary branch, so they carry more weight for me as opposed to Garland.    I mean, it's one thing that Trump could become president again despite what he did on J6, let along get away scot free for this, but the fact that this could happen because six out of the nine justices on our highest court did everything possible to ensure that he doesn't face accountability for what he did on J6 before the election, even going as far as to actually grant him immunity (even though Trump only raised this claim to delay the trial) makes this so much worse in my view which is exactly why I'm blaming SCOTUS if Trump wins.",jonasnew,2024-10-27T11:41:14,2

"Outside of Elon Musk, almost every other well known rich person is vehemently anti-Trump and for every Miriam Adelson, there is a George Soros, a Mark Cuban, or a Bob Iger.  Further, my point was never that none of the wealthiest people in the world support Trump, it was that it is a lot harder to sell the argument that the GOP is the party of big business when every big business is lining up behind the democrats.  Additionally, the claim that a billionaire has led the party for the past 3 cycles isn't wrong, but that kind of falls flat when there has been a lot of discussion and news cycles surrounding democrats claiming he is not worth anywhere close to what he claims.  Look at the spat that's occurring at The Washington Post right now.  People are livid with Jeff Bezos because he decided to endorse no one.  He is being raked over the coals because he didn't oppose Trump.  Not because he is supporting him, but because he thinks that it will help journalistic credibility if the Post endorses no one.  There is no one being pilloried because they traditionally support the GOP but have declined to support either candidate this cycle.  People are even trying to rehab Dick Cheney's public profile because he opposes Trump. Dick. Fucking. Cheney. A person who the left views as a war criminal who gives absolutely no shits about the rights of Americans is being celebrated, not because he recognized he was wrong to do the things people hate him for, but because he is opposing Trump and people think that will help beat him.  Lastly, to your point about Trump being a billionaire.  He has significantly more money than Romney and, yet, the entire campaign against Romney was centered on the proposition that he was an out-of-touch, elitist, extremely wealthy individual (EDIT: AND IT WORKED SPECTACULARLY).  That was never the case with Trump, which you would think would have been a pretty good line of attack against him.  Now, you could argue Clinton was not a good messenger for that attack given her wealth, but still, from the beginning of his candidacy, every institution and powerful business has opposed him.  Even Elon's support of him is more likely because the democrats keep dicking with his companies and refuse to acknowledge Tesla's success because their employees are not part of the UAW.  Prior to the Twitter fiasco, democrats loved Elon.  It wasn't until he bought Twitter, stopped letting liberal politics dictate how its content is moderated, and exposed how much the past owners had bent to political pressure from left leaning politicians that he became persona non grata in the democratic political circles.",[deleted],2024-10-29T10:44:25,-1

In contrast I see Trump as someone who accumulated vast wealth, as with anyone generating that much wealth cutting many corners and breaking many rules, but who lost around a third of it when deciding to dedicate his remaining years to politics; there is nothing cavalier about his want to MAGA - that passes the eye test as genuine to me.

About the 'truth coming out"" as a foregone conclusion, I can't believe. Possibly, yes. Certainly, nah. One would hope though.  As for the other part of your answer, I think it's a pretty good take. I didn't consider that senility might be the ""thing"" that I was picking up on. Which actually makes perfect sense. I had described it as ""simple"", or a child-like quality. Said that I felt bad for her, or at least like she was somewhat vulnerable, essentially. So... that checks out and is... I think I'm able to get my head around my reaction to seeing her, speak and move, behave, whatever you would characterize that as.   It could also be the case, and not run contrary to your pointing to her having been public for years. Because, after all, these things are progressive and by definition, functions of time.  Regarding my ""judgement"", look, true the sample size is small. And certainly, anybody can be shown selectively in a way that misrepresents them. But in the context where I saw her appear, these are not 'enemy camps', or 'unfriendlies', or really adversarial environments in any way, is my assumption, and I'm pretty confident that I'm not mistaken in thinking that.

In terms of what that means, if it matters, is related, not related, factors is, is irrelevant... I have no idea. And it doesn't matter what my opinion is, if I even had one.

"Okay, let's go through the worst case scenario of a Trump/Musk war as you call it.  1. Musk and Trump have some intractable policy dispute. 2. Musk tells Trump that unless he gets his way, he turns off the federal financial system. 3. Trump, not responding well to blackmail, fires Musk. 4. Musk uses his secret (illegal) back door to shut down the federal financial system. 5. Trump orders Musk's arrest, has him shipped to Guantanamo Bay, and has his admin passwords tortured out of him.  The financial system is back up within a day.  Musk's people are similarly fired, arrested, and interrogated.  Musk, if he survives, is stripped of his citizenship and deported.  Trump then invokes the TikTok ban to shut down twitter, cancels all SpaceX contracts, and tariffs every component that goes into a Tesla.  Musk's fortune evaporates.

"I'll give you a really simplified example that might help explain it.  Imagine you own a bakery in Maryland and are the sole employee. The company brings in $100k in revenue in a year, and spends $50k on ingredients, rent, utilities, and other expenses (not including payroll). You then pay yourself the remaining $50k as a salary.  Under the current rules, the company pays no income tax because there was no profit after all expenses (which includes payroll). You then pay a total of $11,350 in state and federal taxes. Total taxes paid = $11,350, your net income = $39,650.  Under the rule you proposed, we tax the company like an individual earning $100k, which means it pays $29,000 in taxes. It is now left with only $21,000 to pay you, and on that $21,000 you pay $3,450 in taxes. Total taxes paid = $32,450. Your net income = $17,550.  Which of these seems like a better idea?",bl1y,2025-02-28T07:25:59,1
"So to start, you have to understand how and why corporate taxes are different.  Individuals are taxed on *income,* while corporations are taxed on *profits.* If a corporation has $1 billion in revenue, and $1 billion in expenses, they pay nothing, because they had $0 in profits. If we charged them 21% on revenue, suddenly that corporation with no profits would owe $210 million; they're losing money and will just have to fold. Taxing corporate revenues tells corporations they must have a profit margin that high just to break even. Very few industries could survive with even a 10% tax on gross revenues.  The next issue is avoiding double taxation. If corporations were taxed on income, what would happen is they bring in revenue, it gets taxed, then they pay a big portion of that revenue out to employees, and it's taxed *a second time.* This kind of double taxation would destroy most industries. Especially because it wouldn't end at double taxation. Farm sells crops to Big Cereal Co, Farm gets taxed on that revenue. Big Cereal Co sells its product to Grocer, and BCC gets taxed on its income. Grocer then sells products to consumers, and gets taxed on the revenue. By the time the grocery store clerk gets paid, that dollar has been taxed a whole bunch. And that leaves far less to pay the worker.  (This is why European countries use a VAT, a value *added* tax. It's essentially a tax only on the profit, not the total revenue. BCC buys $1 of grain and turns it into $2 of cereal, they're taxed on the extra $1 of value added, not the $2 they sell it to Grocer for. Grocer sells the box of cereal for $5, adding $3 of value, and is taxed on that, not the total $5 retail price.)  And the next big difference is that corporations can carry over losses. Imagine a new company invests $1 million in their first year and has $0 revenue as they're getting their factories or whatever built. Next year, they have only $100k in operating expenses, and $500k in revenue. They get to use the past $1 million in expenses to offset their revenue and pay zero taxes. Why? Because so far the company isn't profitable. It's not up $400k, it's down $600k. With corporations we're more concerned with long-term profits rather than ups and downs from year to year because we want corporations to be able to make large investments that won't pay off immediately.  Now I would say we should let individuals get a similar consideration. For instance, a writer who earns $30k as a bar tender for several years finally gets published and earns $500k in one year, then the next year is down to $30k again. Let them spread it out to reflect that the windfall year's earning actually reflect multiple years of work. But, such cases are at the margin and don't affect the typical worker.  So there you go, that's why ""have corporations pay the same rate as everyone else"" just doesn't work.  It's also worth keeping in mind that corporate profits do, eventually, get taxed twice. Once when the company earns the profit, and a second time when its shares are sold and the owner pays capital gains. The federal corporate rate is 21%, and long term capital gains is 15%, for a combined 33% tax rate. For an individual to pay an equivalent rate in federal income taxes, they'd have to earn around $1 million",bl1y,2025-02-27T14:18:38,0

California is guaranteed to go to Democrats, so despite their very large amount of electors, there's no incentive for either campaign to try to win over voters there. Campaigning in California is largely a waste of money outside of things like high-dollar fundraisers that bring in more money than they cost. Tailoring campaign platforms to focus on things Californians care most about doesn't really make sense. The Republican candidate is never going to win over enough voters to flip California, and winning over more voters in California doesn't get the Democratic candidate any additional votes in the electoral college, so why bother? This same thing mostly applies to all entrenched states.  When you add up the electors in all of the entrenched states, it's not enough to get either candidate past the 270 mark they need to win. They both need those last few votes from the swing states to get over the line, and since those are the states that have a chance to ""swing"" towards either candidate, those are the ones where it's most important for candidate to try to win over voters. Winning over just a small amount of voters in those states specifically is what ultimately decides who wins or loses the presidency.

"The policy towards Panama isn't about the US having control, but about China not having control (which would violate the neutrality treaty). The ports on both ends of the canal are owned by a Chinese corporation, which could be ordered by the CCP to close access to American ships, including American warships. There's currently a deal underway for those ports to be sold to an American company, and it's awaiting Panamanian approval, which it will likely get and put at end to the issue. ...At least for the most part, there's a second concern about China's bridge construction over the canal, with the potential that it could be used to sabotage the canal, but the biggest concern was over the ports.  With Greenland, the aim is to have security over the Northwest Passage as climate change is causing the arctic trade routes to be more relevant. Denmark isn't going to sell Greenland, and if Greenland declares independence, it won't join the United States. The most likely outcome here is a deal either to have increased US military presence in Greenland, or for the EU (or Denmark specifically) increase defense spending for the Arctic region.  With Canada, it's a bunch of bluster, probably because Trump wants to annoy Trudeau. There's neither the means nor the will to actually take control of Canada. Canada as the 51st state would give Democrats a permanent majority in the House, and a big advantage in the Senate. Republicans do not want a second California added to the government.

"> That makes sense, but at the same time, he hasn't been tried for that crime, much less convicted.  The law specifies that only intent to commit/aid/conceal a crime is necessary to elevate it to a felony, so it's not really necessary for the prosecution to prove that the crime was actually committed. They just have to convince the jury that the intent was there to commit/aid/conceal the crime when these business records were being falsified.  > I remember something about the judges instructions mentioning to the jury not having to agree on the crime being committed, or something akin to that? If that is the case, then is that technically legal in NY?  Yes, and it's pretty common in other states as well, and at the federal level to some extent.  Take burglary as an example. Burglary is typically defined as breaking into a building with the intent to commit a felony. Any felony will do, and intent is all that's necessary, so if you break into a house with intent to rob it and then get scared off by an alarm before you steal anything, you can still be convicted of burglary if the prosecution can convince the jury that you intended to commit robbery when you broke in. If you break in, beat up the resident, sexually assault the resident, and rob the place, then you've got potentially three felonies that could have been intended at the point of breaking in. It probably varies by state, but in at least some states, the prosecutor isn't required to get the jury to unanimously agree what the original intended felony was at the point of breaking in. They just all have to agree that at least one felony was intended.  >  If one crime was committed in furtherance of another, wouldn't one have to have proven that that second crime which the first one was in furtherance of to have actually been committed?

"Biden and Harris shared their campaign, so as long as Harris remained on the ticket in some way, they keep their funds. If they both were off the ticket, they'd be required to offer refunds to their respective donors, who then would have to make the decision to donate their refunds to the new candidate's campaign.  The challenge from the Republican party, I am assuming, is if they were to do the latter option. Like Fuji\_Ringo said: supposedly they could alternatively transfer the money to the DNC, who could therefore use those funds to support the new candidate, but not necessarily give that candidate the funds to their campaign directly.  Realistically, in my opinion, the challenge is probably meant to be a: ""This probably won't change anything, but if we do manage to win it, the other side will be set back significantly."" When a lot of money moves and has a lot of people involved (donors), it creates an opportunity for the opponent to do whatever they can to disrupt the transfer of money, and maybe, find some sort of grounds along the way. I don't think they'd be successful in their challenge, but the reward of challenging outweighs their risk -- so they're probably thinking: might as well see if we can create some sort of disruption in our favor.

"I know a lot of people will disagree, but I'm very confident in a Harris victory. People forget just how much of a turnoff Trump is, because he hasn't been in the spotlight since 2020(Truly spotlight, most attention from media has been on Biden). Trump has done nothing but lost supporters since 2020, either due to his insurrection attempt, or his multiple convictions, or his recent push further to the right, or his pick of JD for VP, or even his age(now the oldest candidate in American history). Trump and Biden both won about 94% of their respective parties vote. Trump needs to get at least 94% to have a sliver of a chance at the election. During the primary exit polls, 1 in 10 Republicans(not independents, Republicans) said, in no uncertain terms, that there was no way they would back Trump. Trump has done basically nothing to expand his tent, while Harris has done a lot, bringing younger voters, black voters, and asian voters closer in, and will hopefully start pushing for hispanic voters. Trump has also lost quite a lot of voters between 2020 and 2024 due to the affect known as death. A lot of older voters have died, and around 9 million people are dead between 2020 and 2024, a lot of which were older voters who favor Trump. Meanwhile, Harris has had millions of new voters due to the affect of turning 18, and 18 year old's love them some Democrat. In fact, Gen Z is the most left wing party ever, and the anticipated shift of millennials from the left to the right is not happening the way republicans have banked on in past generations. It happened with boomers, it happened with gen x, but it is not happening with millennials, likely because the party has refused to shift policy towards ideals of the younger generation.   Call me crazy, but over the last 4 years I have seen nothing Trump or the Republican party has really done to bring in new voters, while the Democrats have.

Baier: Why did the Border Patrol union say you've been a failure on border security?  Harris: They want support from our border security bill that Trump killed.  Baier: In 2019 you said you supported illegal immigrants getting drivers licenses, free tuition, etc, do you still support that?  Harris: I will follow the law.  Baier: Walz as governor signed those things into state law. Do you support that?  Harris: We must enforce federal law.  Baier: Do you still support using tax payer dollars to help transgender inmates and illegal immigrants transition?  Harris: I will follow the law.  Baier (following up): You have a say in the law.  Harris: Trump spent $20 million on ads and I have a plan for the economy.  Baier: Why do you think more people say they trust Trump on the economy than they trust you?  Harris: People who read the economic studies are ready to turn the page on Trump's rhetoric. Trump would wreck the economy.  Baier: You previously said you can't think of anything you'd do differently from Biden, can you not think of anything?  Harris: My presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden's presidency. I have fresh ideas.  Baier: Your campaign slogan is ""A new way forward"" and ""Time to turn the page."" You've been VP for 3.5 years so what are you turning the page from?  Harris: Trump's rhetoric for the last decade.  Baier: 79% of people say the country is on the wrong track, and you've been in office 3.5 years.  Harris: Donald Trump has been running for office, you know what I'm talking about.  Baier: What are you talking about?  Harris: Trump is unfit to serve.

"> But knowing all that, why he is able to still carry on the Hispanic votes when they know full well he/republicans hate immigration, etc.  First, not all Hispanics in the US are immigrants. Even those who are don't tend to feel much fondness for illegal immigrants, and they apparently don't feel that the Republicans are a threat to legal immigrants, despite the recent Haitian stuff. A lot of Hispanics have expressed support for the Republican efforts to build a wall and increase deportations.  > He openly admits he hates to pay for union workers in his own business, yet the union bosses love him, just ask Sean of the teamsters. I am sure there are union members that will still vote for him.  Just because people are in a union doesn't necessarily mean that they will only vote based on how a candidate feels about unions. They may not even like unions, but they ended up in a job where you basically have to be in one. Or maybe they do like unions, but they care about other things more than unions.  For both Hispanics and union workers, it likely comes down to the same thing: as Democrats have won more and more support among college-educated voters and white-collar professionals over the years, they've become less and less focused on working class issues, and the Republicans have taken the opportunity to make themselves the party of voters who don't have a college education, so truck drivers, construction workers, farmers, miners, etc. have drifted towards the Republicans. A lot of these jobs are unionized.  Tariffs are generally bad economic policy, but if you can convince people that tariffs would make it too expensive to import stuff from overseas and bring factory jobs back to the US, then you can see how that would be attractive policy to workers who don't have a college education.  > Tariffs? I doubt any of that will happen, and that is my point.  Tariffs are probably one of the most likely things to be implemented by Trump because it's one of the few things the president has the power to do without Congress.",Moccus,2024-10-17T12:23:33,4

It's a lot more high profile than immigrants steadily trickling into Germany or something.  Spain and France have also been critical of Israel recently, calling for an arms embargo.

So it's logical that Catholics would prefer to vote for a candidate whose policies align with those views.

"Tariffs are most commonly used to protect/encourage domestic production of certain products. For example, there has been a big push in recent years to get more chip production done state side since computer chips are so important to the nation's economy/security.

On the flip side Trump has had a habit of using tariffs as a political tool (i.e. do X or we will tariff everything coming out of your country) or just basically because he feels like it. This isn't good for American consumers because it just raises prices for things that we may have no interest in producing domestically or even may not be capable of producing. For example, if tariffs are put on a country that produces a lot coffee, then US consumers are just going to pay more for coffee since we can't really grow much coffee domestically due to the climate. Additionally, countries will also hit back with tariffs that make it more difficult for Americans to export things - a lot of Soy bean farmers were basically thrown under the bus during the last Trump admin when their largest buyer (China) implemented retaliatory tariffs.",thewerdy,2025-02-06T12:19:34,2

And FYI, the reason why college is so unaffordable isn't selfishness, but actually egalitarianism. We have a system where student loans are virtually guaranteed for students, but that came with the provision that the banks would be guaranteed their return (ie, no bankruptcy to wipe out your student debt). Since students can pretty much get however much money universities ask for, price sensitivity was greatly diminished and schools could rapidly raise tuition. Imagine if every American was guaranteed a loan for $100,000 that could only be spent on cars what that would do to the price of cars. And all this happened when college was still very affordable. And actually, college is still very affordable if you go to community college for two years, then finish at a state university, and make use of subsidies like Pell grants.  With housing, it's mostly an issue of supply and demand. Our housing stock is pretty low, and there's a lot going into it, but a big issue is still hangover from the 2008 crash and the slowdown in new construction that followed. On the demand side, it's driven in large part by people moving to cities and it's a whole lot faster to move to New York or San Francisco than it is to build new housing there. Then you've also got things like our previously very low interest rates which both drive up demand and make people willing to pay more (similar to how the availability of loans drove up tuition rates).",bl1y,2024-09-16T20:50:57,3

"The legal analysis offered in support of the killing of Anwar al-Awlaki is a little more complex -- and a little less certain -- than just the AUMF let Obama do it.    18 U.S. Code ¬ß 1119 says that if an American kills another American overseas, that's considered murder under U.S. law. Anyone who does it can be tried in the same way as an American who murders someone inside U.S. borders.  But in targeting and killing Awlaki, Obama appears to have relied on the ""public authority"" justification, which allows government officials to break the law when doing so is authorized by ""proper public authority,"" i.e., other laws that give them legal authority to take an otherwise illegal action.   The law that arguably gives that authority is the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) Act.   One counter argument to this is that the AUMF cannot be interpreted this broadly since doing so would be unconstitutional: the Fourth Amendment prohibits the government from executing US citizens without due process of law. If challenged on this point, Obama would presumably argue that denying Awlaki due process of law was legally justified as he posed an ""imminent"" threat and it was unfeasible for the U.S. to arrest him instead of killing him.  A second counter argument is that, while the Authorization for the Use of Military Force Act could potentially justify a military strike under the public authority justification, it doesn't apply in this instance since it was CIA operatives who fired on and killed Awlaki and the CIA isn't part of the regular armed forces.  If you want to dive into this a little deeper, there's a good resource [here](https://www.justsecurity.org/12061/backgrounder-release-justice-departments-targeted-killing-memo/).

"> Critical Race Theory means teaching historical events that apply to the cultures in your classroom in addition to white history.  While not its only flaw, Critical Race Theory is an extremist ideology which advocates for racial segregation. Here is a quote where Critical Race Theory explicitly endorses segregation:  >8 Cultural nationalism/separatism. An emerging strain within CRT holds that people of color can best promote their interest through separation from the American mainstream. Some believe that preserving diversity and separateness will benefit all, not just groups of color. We include here, as well, articles encouraging black nationalism, power, or insurrection. (Theme number 8).  Racial separatism is identified as one of ten major themes of Critical Race Theory in an early bibliography that was codifying CRT with a list of works in the field:  >To be included in the Bibliography, a work needed to address one or more themes we deemed to fall within Critical Race thought. These themes, along with the numbering scheme we have employed, follow:  Delgado, Richard, and Jean Stefancic. ""Critical race theory: An annotated bibliography 1993, a year of transition."" U. Colo. L. Rev. 66 (1994): 159.  One of the cited works under theme 8 analogizes contemporary CRT and Malcolm X's endorsement of Black and White segregation:  >But Malcolm X did identify the basic racial compromise that the incorporation of the ""the civil rights struggle"" into mainstream American culture would eventually embody: Along with the suppression of white racism that was the widely celebrated aim of civil rights reform, the dominant conception of racial justice was framed to require that black nationalists be equated with white supremacists, and that race consciousness on the part of either whites or blacks be marginalized as beyond the good sense of enlightened American culture. When a new generation of scholars embraced race consciousness as a fundamental prism through which to organize social analysis in the latter half of the 1980s, a negative reaction from mainstream academics was predictable. That is, Randall Kennedy's criticism of the work of critical race theorists for being based on racial ""stereotypes"" and ""status-based"" standards is coherent from the vantage point of the reigning interpretation of racial justice. And it was the exclusionary borders of this ideology that Malcolm X identified.  Peller, Gary. ""Race consciousness."" Duke LJ (1990): 758.  This is current and mentioned in the most prominent textbook on CRT:  >The two friends illustrate twin poles in the way minorities of color can represent and position themselves. The nationalist, or separatist, position illustrated by Jamal holds that people of color should embrace their culture and origins. Jamal, who by choice lives in an upscale black neighborhood and sends his children to local schools, could easily fit into mainstream life. But he feels more comfortable working and living in black milieux and considers that he has a duty to contribute to the minority community. Accordingly, he does as much business as possible with other blacks. The last time he and his family moved, for example, he made several phone calls until he found a black-owned moving company. He donates money to several African American philanthropies and colleges. And, of course, his work in the music industry allows him the opportunity to boost the careers of black musicians, which he does.

"I am not sure where you are getting your information from but there are some key-factors that many are missing.   1. Trump announcing this was just a formality the ""Never Fail Weapon System or NGI Next Generation Interceptor system"" has been in development, testing for awhile now. It will combine what we already have like Aegis which is pretty much in operation and tested the ability to intercept ICBM's and will add a multi layered approach including new interceptors.      2. Many times by the time the public hears about it and a government official announces it we are already into the implementation stage. Why tell your potential enemy we haven't started a defense against your stuff? For examples look at the stealth program, it was around for ages before the public knew about it.  Missile defense technology being developed, tested and deployed by the United States is designed to counter ballistic missiles of all ranges -- short, medium, intermediate and long. Since ballistic missiles have different ranges, speeds and size and performance characteristics, the Ballistic Missile Defense System is an integrated, ""layered"" architecture that provides multiple opportunities to destroy missiles and their warheads before they can reach their targets. The system's architecture includes:  * Networked sensors (including space-based) and ground- and sea-based radars for target detection and tracking; * Ground- and sea-based interceptor missiles for destroying a ballistic missile using either the force of a direct collision, called ""hit-to-kill"" technology, or an explosive blast fragmentation warhead, and; * A command, control, battle management and communications network providing the operational commanders with the needed links between the sensors and interceptor missiles. * Layers: NGI missiles will be able to intercept ICBM's, Hypersonic missiles. Layer 2 will be THAAD and Aegis,   But maybe you're right this general consensus you speak of is likely filled with tons of experts and we should just give up.",RadiantJaguar8030,2025-01-29T09:41:41,3

"> If an illegal immigrant is in police custody, what is the argument against deporting them?  The main argument would be that it sows distrust between the illegal immigrant community and the local police. Illegal immigrants who risk deportation if they ever end up in police custody would understandably try to avoid any and all interaction with the police. An entire community of people who never report crimes to the police and never give witness statements is bad for the overall safety of the entire city. That's part of why there was pushback against this law. It was taking away the ability of local authorities to decide what policy was best for the safety of their city/county.  > Should New Jersey not contact New York to let them know they've got you in custody?  The difference is that there generally aren't whole communities of people living in the same area who are all wanted for crimes in the next state over, so you don't have the same safety concerns where entire neighborhoods who won't talk to police.  Also, I don't think being deported to another country is comparable to being driven to the next state over to deal with a low level warrant.

"If we're going with a capitalist vs socialist dichotomy, then I don't think you can say ""the left wing is in favor of people's rights."" That's not their primary organizing principle -- quite fundamentally they are opposed to certain property rights. Their primary focus is around people's material wellbeing, not their rights.  Moving on, I'll preface the next bit by saying I don't know much about the histories of Latin American countries, so I'm just going to offer a hypothetical to point out what could be a problem with the question.  During WWII, Britain had to engage in rationing. Rationing is a policy that could be described as ""making sure everyone has enough"" (in terms of material goods, primarily food). But, post-war Britain with no rationing was much better off materially (including in terms of food). But if countries that engage in rationing are meant to make sure everyone has enough, why are people in countries without rationing so much better off?  I think the flaw here is obvious, and it's because the question is sidestepping why a country would engage in rationing in the first place. Only countries with very scarce resources have to ration; countries with abundance do not. No surprise that countries with abundant resources are better off.  I don't know if it's the case with the countries you have in mind, but I think a good place to start would be to look at just the underlying economic conditions in those countries before adopting socialist policies.",bl1y,2025-01-03T18:01:20,0
"Because we're a country that has always prided itself in it's history of immigrants, at least in terms of how we talk and teach about it. ""The Great American Melting Pot"" and what not. The idea that we, as a country, bring people in and become stronger for it is a part of the American myth. Now, has that ever truly been the reality of America? Probably not but I think that kind of national identity is why birthright citizenship is a big deal to people.  In terms of why people think it's ""restarting the Holocaust"", it's pretty obvious Trump only wants to get rid of birthright citizenship because he hates illegal immigrants. The worry (and I'm not saying *I* think this will happen) is that Trump will push all of these different plans for rounding up and detaining immigrants under the guise of deportation, determine that due process takes too long and either use imprisoned illegal immigrants as a labor force or just straight up find reasons to kill them. Getting rid of birthright citizenship just means there's less legal headache to get to the detainment part, because rather than a potential family of 2 illegal parents and a child citizen, you can just say there's 3 illegal immigrants and throw them in jail.

"I chose my words very carefully to avoid ambiguity because I didn't want to mislead you, which I suppose I have.  First, it's very important to properly define the political terminology because you appear to be confounding them:  Liberal / Conservative -> how open you are to change Right / Left -> alignment of political ideology  Republican / Democrat -> political parties.   It is theoretically possible to be a conservative Democrat who leans right or a liberal Republican that leans left. Actually, Republicans used to be the left-leaning party back during the Civil War era.   > ""I'm objectively right, and if you don't see that, it's only because you're stupid.""  > You genuinely don't believe it's possible for someone intelligent to ever, in good faith, not agree with, in *your* own words, ""liberal ideology.""  I never said that. You are using the term 'liberal ideology' interchangeably with other terms and are making up an argument as a result. By proper definition, 'liberal ideology' means that you are willing to consider viewpoints outside of your own and accept change, which is a matter of stubbornness rather than intelligence. The leftists that you are generalizing may actually lean conservative, which I can agree with from experience.  > ""anyone who disagrees with my political ideology is stupid and uneducated""  To restate, it's not your political ideology but the Republican party specifically. The current party is corrupt, controlling, and downright harmful to society.

"No, I'd tend to agree.   I'd consider myself fairly progressive as far as social issues go. Pro-LGBT rights and protections. I believe outreach into impoverished (generally POC communities) is worthwhile. I don't care if people smoke weed and think it's very much a ""state-run"" issue.  Where I've gotten uncomfortable with the Democratic side -- and you see the extremes happen both ways -- is that I may agree in principle on many of the social positions that Democrats hold, but they have made the mistake of taking it a step further. There's a lot of gaslighting going on of Republican voters, ie ""What? How could you *possibly* think this is problematic?"" I think a lot of issues within my own ""community"" (LGBT) are of messaging. I have lived and worked in some of the most conservative insitutions in the country: Military, Fire Department, ""boots on the ground"" handyman stuff, whatever, and to be honest, the worst treatment I got from people was in high school when kids are just dumb as fuck. The majority don't care if you are competent and a good person.  Even though I want us to be a respectful, tolerant society, I think Republicans get wrongly mischaracterized as a whole based on the statements of a few fringe people. When it came to the transgender issue, for example, while most trans folks I have met are fairly reasonable, you can't raise any kind of concern or have any kind of discussion without getting shut down as a bigot. A little bit of education and discussion on both sides would go a long way.  Frankly I've got a lot to say about how Democratic messaging, so all this to say: I get it.

"I think you give Trump entirely too much credit in labeling him ""fully aware"". I don't mean that in a snarky way, but we have watched Trump repeatedly fall for his own bluster and bullshit. In 2016, at one of his rallies (as he explained in an interview with Bob Woodward), he threw out the idea of ""We're going to build a wall!"" just off the cuff. He got a big cheer from the crowd for that. So he said it again, and got an even bigger cheer. After that, it became a staple of his rallies, then a chant, then it became official policy of his administration.   And in 2021 at one of his rallies, he said that everybody should get vaccinated, and that he was vaccinated. His crowd booed. He got a little worried looking, and then said that it was a personal choice. There was some grumbling from the crowd. He has never mentioned getting vaccinated for COVID since.   Like all populists, Trump's ""policies"" are very much at the mercy of popular support. He won't pursue anything his supporters don't cheer for, and he will drop anything they stand against. That's not a problem for him, because he doesn't really have any clear ideas or policies beyond his own personal aggrandizement. If MAGA gets fully onboard with forcing Canada to become the 51st state, Trump will pursue it.

They may be unwilling to relocate to where the jobs are or don't know how to ask or seek better-paying jobs.   This is not considered he most useful metric because of these external factors. Unfortunately, people are not truly interchangeable.  It's not so simple that we have 1000 jobs and 1000 people willing to work. Most jobs have specific skill experience requirements that only some people can fill and people also need to be willing to move to the job and know that it exists. It's not like this is easily fixable. IE we can't make 60 years old man who works as a janitor fill the role of surgeon at a hospital. The put the 60-year-old in med school and by the time he gets out, he is retirement age and may lack the intellect even to graduate",cdrcdr12,2024-08-23T13:26:56,1

"""Official Acts"" are for the courts to decide if a former President is sued or criminally charged. Sitting presidents cannot be prosecuted, fyi.   Example:  ¬∞ Bernie Sanders gets a big following and launches peaceful protests against Trump  ¬∞ Trump decides to use Seal Team 6 to murder Bernie Sanders  ¬∞ Trump cannot be prosecuted once out of office because he will claim ""it was an official act""  Murder is not ""Authorized by Law"". Trump can claim ""official act"" all he wants, but murder is murder. If a judge rules it was an official act, Trump cannot be punished for murder.  Laws are passed by Congress. The Supreme Court cannot create laws, it can only interpret them. (Well, in a perfect world, that is.)  Nonetheless, Trump is not ""Authorized by Law"" to commit murder, but he very well may get away with it because of the Supreme Court's interpretation of the law.  Saying that all official acts are Authorized by Law is wishful thinking at best. Anyone who has been paying attention already knows that 2-3 lawsuits a day are being filed against Trump's Executive Orders.

"You're bringing in a whole bunch of other unrelated things, let's stick to the actual karmela Harris policies.   The 50K tax credit for opening a business, That's a credit so a business would have to have enough tax burden to qualify for the whole 50k so in practice it would be a lot less than 50K. This is only for the first year of operation, If the business succeeds for 5-10+ years it's paying taxes for all those years, so long-term it should be a net benefit to the federal deficit.   The 25K, I'd be totally fine with this having an income cap as well, Just like they do on the electric car tax credit. So let's say you qualify for the 25K only if your income is below 150k, or 200k joint filers. Owning a home is one of the best ways to build wealth in our country, so moving somebody from being a renter to an owner, hopefully allows that person/family to move into the middle class and when you expand the middle class you increase spending and their tax contribution. This one is less clear cut and probably does cost us a little bit, but at the same time taxes on billionaires and corporations is at the lowest level it's been since before the 1970s,. Kamela also plans to increase corporate tax rates 28% from 21%, and that could hopefully offset this. We have places like Walmart which we as taxpayers subsidized their non-living wage pay. Do a search and you'll see US taxpayers are providing subsidies of 6.2 billion dollars to Walmart workers. When you factor in the indirect tax credit that we give to Walmart workers, Walmart's effective tax rate is well below 21%. I looked it up in Walmart paid an income tax of $5.7  billion in 2023, and then us taxpayers subsidize their workers by 6.2 billion (sorry this again is a tangent but I thought it was interesting)  The $6,000 tax credit you said you liked so I'll leave that one as is. I'd say this one should also have an income limit to qualify.",cdrcdr12,2024-09-17T07:58:18,2

"Having my voice heard over the fact that it's the Supreme Court's fault is exactly how I'm coping with Trump's win.  We have two months until Trump returns to the WH which gives me plenty of time to call out the Supreme Court.  To specify why I'm blaming them, polls in late 2023/early 2024 generally had Trump ahead of Biden, yet when the question was asked who'd they support if Trump got convicted on J6, Biden pulled ahead believe it or not.  This showed that even Biden, of all people, had a really good chance at defeating Trump if the latter was held accountable for J6, and if Biden even had a chance, then Kamala would've most definitely soundly defeated Trump if he got convicted on the J6 charges.  SCOTUS was the reason to why we didn't get the J6 trial before the election.  When the DC Circuit shot down Trump's stupid immunity claim (that he brought up only to delay the trial) in early Feb, it seemed that Trump was going to face accountability before the election after all.  But then, SCOTUS interfered and did everything to ensure that Trump doesn't face accountability for what he did.  First, they decided to hear the immunity case when they shouldn't have, then, they moved so slowly on it, waiting until late April to have the oral arguments, then waited all the way to July to hand down the opinion, and finally, and worst of all, the opinion itself where they actually gave Trump some immunity which could lead to some major consequences once Trump is back in the WH.  Had it not been for their interference and their immunity ruling, Trump would've likely been found guilty for J6 by the time of the election, and this consequently would've led to him losing the election badly and facing prison time right now, but instead, he got away with it and is returning to the WH all because six justices on our highest court did everything to protect him which goes against what they were supposed to do.  This is exactly why I'm blaming the Supreme Court to why we're in this position, and I have every right to do so.",jonasnew,2024-11-11T14:56:23,1

We need more farm labor, but more like we need for a short time, the rate at which mechanization is going you wouldn't need as much. Also it is hard to prove that the cost benefit is being passed to consumers. Most of it goes to shareholders      The other side of the argument is also that, when your farm hands make more they spend more on other services. One thing that is for certain, when you suppress wages like this, the net beneficiary is not the population but the rich. Do you know how much uber keeps as margin - More than half on illegals driving uber, while they claim 30%. Ask a driver. So net net when u have more drivers, uber has more pricing power for their share, eventually this migration leads to filling the pockets of companies like uber's shareholders.

"> ""I'm not sure where you're gettin that data you claim from; from what I've seen there's pretty clear electoral college advantage to whoever has more control in smaller less populated states, which has been the republicans for quite some time now.""  From a 2013 article by Nate Cohn:  [The project to create fifty equally populated states is framed as an Electoral College reform because it would correct one of the best known biases in the Electoral College: the system‚Äôs bias toward small states. **But the Electoral College is even more biased toward candidates that efficiently distribute their share of the popular vote to win a larger number of states by a smaller margin**.](https://newrepublic.com/article/112467/electoral-college-reform-romney-wins-redrawn-us-map)  From a 2013 article by Nate Silver:  [""As a result, the Electoral College does not convey all that much advantage to rural voters versus urban ones, or wealthy voters versus poorer ones, and therefore does not provide all that much long-term advantage toward either party. The Democrats slightly benefited from the Electoral College in 2008 and 2012, but the opposite was true as recently as 2000.""](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/did-democrats-get-lucky-in-the-electoral-college/)  In 2004, 2008, and 2012, the Democrats had an Electoral College advantage -- and hell, even as recently as the 2022 midterms, moreover, the Democrats had a congressional advantage, due to the GOP's House popular vote total being higher than its seats won based on allotted percentage -- so this isn't some black-and-white matter; there are shades of grey aplenty.  I might be soapboxing, but that sure beats your platitudinous attempt at a rebuttal. With that, a bit of introspection, self-reflection, and holding the proverbial mirror to one's face may, if you're wiling to engage in earnest, greatly benefit you and your ilk, because taking a broader, bigger picture view of our bendy, elastic, ever-evolving realignment is quite critically key; otherwise, you'll maybe find yourself caught flat-footed and, um, get your ass handed to you as a result.",NoExcuses1984,2024-06-11T14:13:45,0

It actually is in her power to do so it's in the fucking Constitution. When a president is no longer mentally fit to handle his duties you're supposed to step up and take over the office. He was not mentally fit to handle his duties and everybody knows that. His wife was handling business for him when he was in the room! What do you say about that if he's mentally fit why isn't he sitting at the head of the table answering questions instead of his wife answering questions says he sits her drooling. I do not know the exact procedures but it is in the Constitution when the president is not fit for duty the vice president is constitutionally ordered to step up and take over.  And yes he was in situation where he wasn't prosecuted because after a lengthy 5-hour interview it was decided that a jury would never convict because he would be seen as a nice elderly gentleman with a poor memory. This is the $345 page report when they're trying to convict him handling classified information like an elderly man with poor memory which is illegal and which means that he is not mentally fit to be in the situations anymore if a president of the United States cannot handle classified material that he can't be president either and constitutionally the vice president was supposed to step up and take over the job. She want to take back your statements about being mean a liar cuz I looked this up as I was writing it nothing I said was a lie might not have been exactly correct according to you but you didn't offer anything else as solutions to prove me lie except for you said so. If you and your right mind whatever you want to call that think that Joe Biden is mentally fit to be a president you have a problem with your own mental capacity. Two and a half years ago I could look at him and I could tell that he was in a no state to be the president of our country. He looked lost all the time he's fumbling his words he reminded me my grandpa when he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. I mean for Christ's sake the man had his wife in on top secret confidential meetings and she was answering all the questions and making all the statements what he sat there literally drooling. And by the way that is illegal too she was not elected in at all she's got no top secret clearance I don't think and she's no business being at these meetings when the American public doesn't know. It's against all laws and if Kamala was a competent person she would have been the person to do it but no she decided she wanted to be president so she did not do her constitutional duty and step up and do what she supposed to do.

">His campaign and policy staff are literally talking about building concentration camps once they have power again  Do you know of any sources for this? I looked this up and only found two instances where there was talk of (1) detention camps for illegal immigrants while awaiting deportation, and (2) camps for the homeless so they're not laying out in the streets. When people use the term *concentration camp*, they're usually referring to the Nazi death camps rather than a more general internment camp. By either definition, a camp for homeless people to stay (which would be voluntary) or detention centers to hold illegal immigrants awaiting deportation are a far cry from some permanent camp for ""undesirables"". Using the term ""concentration camp"" here is a deliberate attempt to conflate homeless or deportation camps with Nazi death camps. However, they're obviously very different.  Personally, if I were in charge I would not be looking to deport illegal immigrants, but doing so isn't exactly the most horrific, unthinkable government action one could imagine.  And with the millions dying thing, if you're talking about COVID, that would've happened no matter who was President.

I do think Trump‚Äôs going to see a lot more pushback from within his administration because of this.  Also, taking Canada isn‚Äôt a popular policy anyways, so it feels like a moot point that Trump would do it *if* people wanted it.  I think that for all of Trump‚Äôs wildness, there is an inherent logic to his style of international politics that can be understood through the Art of the Deal. He‚Äôs openly written that he starts negotiations with hyperbole meant to shock people at the other side of the table, and to use any leverage available. He has an aggressive negotiating style with friends and foes alike, so his rhetoric towards them is a poor indication of what he actually wants to accomplish.",AgentQwas,2025-03-09T17:52:21,0

"He actually called for him to be impeached for being ""crooked,"" and the press secretary later said it was in response to a decision based on politics rather than law. It hardly seems impeachable to call for a judge to be impeached on those grounds, even if they prove to be false. Should AOC and other members of Congress be impeached for calling for Kavanaugh or other justices to be impeached?  Surely if a politician calls for someone to be impeached when they don't deserve it, the correct response is simply to not impeach that person.  And as for the court order, again, we don't even have a ruling from a judge that the order was ignored.  Court orders do actually get ignored pretty often, and we don't jump from that to the most extreme response. What happens is the court first determines that the order wasn't followed, then *maybe* there would be a charge for contempt. Might not be a contempt charge though, if the party begins complying, or the contempt charge might be purged.

"> voluntarily assuming the care of another   1. You‚Äôre interpreting the above much more broadly than it‚Äôs actually specified legally.

"Okay, lets back up.  Billionaires, as a rule, acquire their wealth through long-term capital gains.  Long term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than actual income.  We could stop here, but lets continue.    Capital gains are not taxed until they're sold.  We can debate the merits of that, but we both agree it's true.  So even though billionaires have acquired billions of dollars worth of wealth in the past few years, very little of it is technically ""income"", and therefore is totally untaxed.    Even without liquidating that wealth, it can be leveraged to purchase things anyway.  For example, Musk leveraged billions of dollars worth of Tesla stock to buy Twitter, but did not pay taxes on it, because he didn't *sell* it.    If billionaires can manage to go their whole lives without technically selling their assets, when those assets are inherited, all capital gains are reset to zero.  This is called step up basis.

"You're citing the well-known famous violinist example. Just as a matter of practice, before being the most pro-anything on any position, you might want to consider that very smart people (smarter than either of us) have considered those arguments and landed on good faith disagreements about them.  With the IV example, you've omitted a quirk of the thought experiment that complicates things quite a bit. Of course we cannot compel you to connect the IV. But suppose that instead you woke up with the IV already connected. If you disconnect it now, the other person will die. However, if you leave it connected for a few months, then you may disconnect it, and both of you will live. Do we allow you to disconnect it? Reasonable minds disagree on that one.  But, with abortion this gets much more complicated because the fetus becomes viable a considerable amount of time before birth. When we consider post-viability cases, we could agree that the mother has the right to end the pregnancy -- but if the fetus can survive on its own, couldn't we demand that the pregnancy be ended in a way that preserves the fetus's life? That is to say, either inducing labor or C section.  To go back to the famous violinist hypothetical. Suppose the person connected to you via IV is capable of living if the IV were disconnected. Are you then, in that situation, permitted to disconnect the IV in a way that kills them? I'd think not. And if the argument is that you get to preserve your bodily autonomy, surely the other person also has the right to preserve their bodily autonomy, and being killed is as grave a violation to bodily autonomy as we can imagine.  And I'll leave you with one more hypothetical: Suppose there is a 4 year old child who needs a kidney transplant, and you are the only match on the planet. (And for reference, people can live perfectly healthy lives with only one kidney. The donation isn't without risk, but it's relatively small.) Surely you are entitled to decline to make the donation.

"Sort of, but even assuming that everybody in lower income communities deals with identical issues getting IDs:  1. African-Americans make up a higher proportion of the lower income community compared to the general population. 2. African-Americans overwhelmingly vote for Democrats. 3. It follows that anything that makes it harder for the lower income population as a whole to vote will harm the Democrats more than it will harm the Republicans, so Republicans are incentivized to implement policies that make it harder for the lower income population to vote.  That being said there are differences between the low-income white population and the low-income African-American population that are relevant:  1. Low-income whites are more likely to live in rural areas or small towns, while low-income African-Americans tend to live in urban areas and can get around by walking or public transportation. 2. Despite any added difficulty, low-income whites basically have to go through the trouble of getting a driver's license out of necessity in order to be able to go into town for groceries or get to work. Since most of them get a driver's license as a necessity, they can vote by default. 3. Low-income white people are far more likely to own a home and stay in one place for a long time. Low-income minorities who live in urban areas are more likely to rent and move around a lot. Every move increases the chances of losing vital documents, and changing addresses means more work to keep IDs up to date. 4. There are African-Americans alive today who were born in the Jim Crow South and were never issued a birth certificate due to discriminatory policies in place at the time. This is something that low-income whites born at the same time didn't have to deal with, and it's not easy to resolve.

"> Reporting a crime to the police doesn't land you in custody, so there's a whole big concern off the table.   Reporting a crime absolutely can land you in custody. It can even get you shot and killed by police as we learned in the Justine Diamond case. Report domestic violence against you and they could very well decide you're the aggressor and arrest you. Report that you were attacked by some guy on the street and you fought back and they could decide you both should be charged with battery. There could be a clerical error at the court that results in a warrant that you don't know about, so as soon as you report a crime and the police take your information while interviewing you, they have reason to arrest you. These are all unlikely, but when you're facing deportation, why risk it?  > And that bike thief is facing more severe penalties than you might think. He faces potentially a year in prison.

It's balancing the interest of enforcing every law against the overall public good.

If we insisted on arresting every teenager we caught drinking, then we'd have a lot more kids dead from alcohol poisoning because their friends were too afraid of being arrested to call for help.

When a president is no longer mentally fit to handle his duties you're supposed to step up and take over the office.  She can't.

Being seen as a nice elderly gentleman with a poor memory isn't the same thing as being mentally incompetent to stand trial. The prosecutor was predicting that the defense lawyers would try to get the jury to see him that way in order to garner sympathy. He wasn't saying that Biden is definitively mentally unwell. 2. That's not why he wasn't prosecuted. He wasn't prosecuted because the prosecutor lacked sufficient evidence to prove that a crime occurred beyond a reasonable doubt. The prosecutor listed off the pieces of evidence he had that indicated a possible crime, and in every case, he pointed out a possible alternative explanation that would indicate no crime had occurred. That's reasonable doubt, so the prosecutor essentially said that a jury shouldn't convict him even before he talked about the ""nice elderly gentleman with a poor memory"" thing. He brought up the ""nice elderly gentleman"" thing to point out that if the defense got a jury to view him that way, then they would be even more likely than normal to look for the innocent explanations, making it even more difficult to get a conviction.  > This is the $345 page report when they're trying to convict him handling classified information like an elderly man with poor memory which is illegal  It wasn't illegal, which is why he wasn't prosecuted.  > if a president of the United States cannot handle classified material that he can't be president  Agreed.

"2 million isn't a lot in terms of deportations, especially in that era. The US gained more than 2 million illegal immigrants over the same time period, so any undocumented laborer who was deported was replaced with another one relatively quickly. That was in part because Obama's immigration policies were fairly lax compared to GWB's, which encouraged people to come here, and also in part because the fallout of the 2008 recession was rough on Mexico, and the unemployed there went abroad in search of work. That was a major focus of Trump's 2016 campaign messaging--that he would crack down on Obama's lax immigration policies, and that by doing so, illegal immigrants would be dissuaded from coming.  So if your argument is that Trump can replicate what Obama did without consumers feeling it at all--then the way that Obama did it was by illegal immigration remaining at high enough levels to offset his deportations. Which is very much what Trump doesn't want, and has argued he'll fight against. There isn't a way to have negative net illegal immigration *and* no effect on agricultural prices.

"> They don‚Äôt have a familial or caregiver relationship, they aren‚Äôt a civil servant with those specific duties, they didn‚Äôt cause the fire and they aren‚Äôt contractually obligated to do anything. Those are the very specific legal criteria  No, those things are covered in the other criteria:  >There are at least four situations in which the failure to act may constitute breach of a legal duty. One can be held criminally liable: first, where a statute imposes a duty to care for another;  second, where one stands in a certain status relationship to another;  third, where one has assumed a contractual duty to care for another;  and fourth, where one has voluntarily assumed the care of another and so secluded the helpless person as to prevent others from rendering aid. (Jones v. US, 1962)  The familial relationship part is ""certain status relationship,"" and caregiver (like a at home nurse) is ""assumed a contractual duty."" The fourth one is about someone stepping in to render aid and then deciding not to do so.  Maybe the confusion here is because we're imagining two different scenarios, so let me try again with something more clear cut:  A pedestrian is hit by a car, seriously injured, and looks like they'll die without medical help. There's six bystanders. One of them shouts ""someone call 911!"" Another bystander gets out his phone and says ""I'm on it!"" He talks on the phone for a minute and then says ""Hang on, an ambulance is on the way."" But in truth, he didn't call anyone and just pretended. Half an hour later the pedestrian dies, but would have lived if given medical treatment. The guy who pretended to call for help but didn't will be criminally liable for that death. He voluntarily stepped and his actions precluded others from helping (because of his actions, the others believed they didn't need to call 911 and so did not).  It's extraordinarily rare, to the point where the court in Jones had to cite British cases from the 1800s. And it's easy to see why it's rare, because that's just not the way people act. In fact, the textbook example with the drowning person has the rescuer not just say fuck it and turn back for no reason, but rather he exhausts himself swimming out against a strong current and is forced to turn back or else risk drowning himself. The underlying rule is that once he's stepped in to render aid he has a legal obligation to see it through, but is saved from liability by the impossibility of the situation.  It's a huge stretch to apply this sort of liability to health insurance companies, and I don't think the argument would ultimately be successful. And it's all predicated on the insurance agreement actually saying they would aid in those specific circumstances *and* that other insurers would not have also denied the claim.  But also, the contractual duty actually exists here, so we don't even need to go down this rabbit hole. It's just a question of what the specific contractual duty is.  >Also, kill the Bard.

"The $50,000 tax credit means businesses would be started that wouldn't have otherwise, or businesses that would fail in the first year may survive do another year and become profitable such that they can sustain and pay into the tax base.    As I said, the housing credit, means expanding the middle class, and expanded middle class means a larger tax base to collect taxes from. And I did concede that this one would cost us money but at the same time she also proposed corporate tax increase from 21% to 28%.   Sorry I confused you with the other thread regarding the $6,000 tax credit for new borns. Long-term this is important, we have a declining population with the exception of immigration, and these things like social security and Medicare funding are only going to get worse because we won't have as many people paying into the tax system to fund those programs. So yeah the benefit there is 20 years down the line and hopefully there's more people paying into the system. We should want the current generation to have a lot of children, who are educated and solve future problems and painted the tax system.   The reason why I say it's selfish but then also pays back into the system, Is because I people largely see policies and programs through the lens of their selfish bias. You don't want to pay now in higher taxes so when you see these programs you find ways to spin them in ways that you can justify why you should not paying for them. Same goes for those of us who want these programs because we want to build a better world, though we're willing to try things and fail rather than instinctively reject everything by default because it costs us something now.",cdrcdr12,2024-09-17T09:09:21,2

"> I think you meant liability protections.  Yes, you're correct.  > Or to put a finer point on it: Why should a perfectly safe vaccine that isn't going to harm a patient need special liability protection if it ends up harming the patient?  Because people believe a bunch of fake stuff about vaccines and their claims don't have to be true in order to file a lawsuit.  These liability protections exist because of a situation that occurred in the 1970s and 1980s when people wrongly blamed the pertussis vaccine for permanent brain damage in some children. The resulting lawsuits were financially damaging enough that almost all manufacturers stopped making pertussis vaccines. It just wasn't worth it given the low margins on vaccines. When people stopped being able to get the vaccine for their kids, we collectively decided that it was better to have the pertussis vaccine around, which meant the system had to change to make it financially viable for the manufacturers to start making them again without being sued into oblivion every time somebody convinced the population that vaccines cause autism, brain damage, death, or whatever other malady that people try to blame on vaccines.",Moccus,2024-11-15T11:31:34,3

A Gallup poll last month found more Americans approving of Mr. Trump‚Äôs handling of his transition than at around the same time eight years earlier, though those numbers still significantly trailed other recent presidents-elect. >  > ‚ÄúBy winning a second time and by winning the popular vote, Trump now has greater legitimacy than in 2016,‚Äù said Miro Weinberger, who during Mr. Trump‚Äôs first term was the mayor of Burlington in Vermont, a famously progressive state where Republicans made surprising gains in the fall. ‚ÄúThat is causing deeper reflection this time about the ways in which Democratic governance is failing.‚Äù >  > Of course, Democrats stressed in interviews, Mr. Trump, who will be the first felon to serve as president and whose re-election bid was opposed by some who worked with him most closely last time, has yet to take office. >  > Once he does, the policies he and the Republican Congress pursue may well prompt the kind of broad backlash that propelled Democrats to many of their victories over the last eight years and create new pressures on elected Democrats to oppose him wherever possible. >  > Honeymoon periods never last, and for Mr. Trump ‚Äî an exceptionally polarizing leader in a closely divided country ‚Äî it could be especially short. >  > Efforts to check Mr. Trump are also already underway from a range of Democratic state officials and advocacy groups, especially in blue states, while Democrats from more conservative areas, too, have cautioned against over-reading the election results. >  > ‚ÄúMy takeaway is there is not a clear mandate, and that the people of eastern North Carolina, in particular, want us to come to Washington, D.C., and work for them,‚Äù said Representative Don Davis, a North Carolina Democrat who won a district that also supported Mr. Trump. >  > Democratic energy more broadly will not be dormant, lawmakers argue, if Republicans threaten the social safety net or target abortion rights. The far-reaching crackdowns on undocumented immigrants Mr. Trump has proposed also have the potential to create wrenching scenes with unpredictable political reactions. >  > ‚ÄúIf this administration and Congress attempts to institute a nationwide abortion ban, you‚Äôre going to see that type of protest happen again,‚Äù said Representative Susie Lee, a Nevada Democrat who won in a district Mr. Trump also captured in November. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre moving into a period where everyone‚Äôs just going to, you know, sit back and let horrible policies like that be enacted.‚Äù >  > ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs picking those areas where you have to hold firm, but without making it every single thing, a knee-jerk reaction to everything that comes out of the administration,‚Äù Ms. Lee added. >  > The fissures and dilemmas around how to do that are already coming into view, especially on the issue of immigration. >  > Last week, the House passed a bill targeting undocumented immigrants charged with nonviolent crimes for deportation, with support from Republicans and nearly 50 Democrats. >  > Representative Maxwell Frost, a Florida Democrat who opposed that measure, said he worried that some in his party were misreading the lessons from Mr. Trump‚Äôs re-election bid, which included a promise to carry out mass deportations. >  > ‚ÄúThe first election, everyone thought it was just a fluke, and they felt like, you know, it wasn‚Äôt where the American people were at,‚Äù Mr. Frost said. ‚ÄúThis time, there are a lot of Democrats that are worried that this wasn‚Äôt a fluke, and this is what people want, the most extreme parts of his agenda.‚Äù >  > He warned against that interpretation, arguing that many Americans simply voted for Mr. Trump ‚Äúbecause he was effectively able to make this a referendum on how people feel about the economy.‚Äù >  > But Mr. Frost, who also described his party‚Äôs messaging challenges, insisted that he was not in Washington ‚Äúto just resist.‚Äù >  > ‚ÄúYes, we will be resisting and pushing back against parts of his agenda we disagree with, 100 percent,‚Äù he said. But he added that he would > also look for areas of potential cooperation with Republicans, though he was skeptical of how much good-faith negotiating Republicans would be willing to do. >  > ‚ÄúI‚Äôm keeping an open mind for sure, but people can‚Äôt blame me for coming to the table with an eyebrow raised,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm not there to work.‚Äù >  > Representative Pat Ryan, a New York Democrat from a more competitive district, has in some ways laid out a similar approach toward Mr. Trump. >  > He offered to travel to Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump‚Äôs Florida home and private club, for negotiations concerning removing the state and local tax deduction cap. And he said in an interview that he would work with anyone, including Mr. Trump, to ‚Äúmake my community more affordable, more safe and more free.‚Äù >  > ‚ÄúIf he‚Äôs doing anything counter to those goals, I will fight to the end of the earth,‚Äù Mr. Ryan pledged. >  > Just don‚Äôt call that resistance. >  > ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think anybody in the real world thinks about it that way,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre thinking about their lives.

The types of people who work in presidential administrations tend to be really interested in policy and involved in the future plans of the party. And if you were trying to get a group together, having a bunch of former White House staff involved would lend it a lot of weight.

"I'll go with the definition from wikipedia:  >Authoritarianism is a political system characterized by the rejection of political plurality, the use of strong central power to preserve the political status quo, and reductions in democracy, separation of powers, civil liberties, and the rule of law.  We aren't seeing threats to political plurality. In fact, we seem to have *increasing* plurality with more distinct factions within the two main parties (MAGA vs traditional GOP on the right, progressives vs traditional Democrats on the left).  Trump's actions to dismantle much of the bureaucracy and move more power down to the states seems to be the opposite of centralizing power or preserving the political status quo.  We haven't seen much by way of reductions in democracy. You could argue there's a few cases with access to polling places, but we're largely expanding voting. 2024 had notably *high* voter turnout, second only to 2020, where the rules under Covid made it a particular outlier.  There's likely some issues regarding separation of powers under Trump, but we still have to wait for things to shake out. For instance, with impoundment, the Executive has until the end of the fiscal year (September) to disperse funds. With court rulings, again, wait and see what happens after we get rulings from SCOTUS. I'm not going to say ""I'm worried Trump will defy the Court *later*"" equates to ""we are *at this moment* becoming authoritarian.""  Civil liberties are doing fine. The main thing you could point to here is abortion, but that's an instance where I think there is real debate over when the state has the right to step in and regulate.  And as for the rule of law, again, we have to wait to see how things go. Plenty of presidents have taken actions that get challenged in the courts. We have to see how the administration responds as cases go against them.  Now I suppose you could point to some examples that make it seem like things are more dire than how I've laid them out, but I can easily point to things from the Biden administration that would do the same. But we're talking about a system that is still like 95%+ liberal democracy, and has always fluctuated a little bit in the remaining 5%. That bit of fluctuation isn't authoritarianism. I'd say authoritarianism is when the system *primarily* is authoritarian.",bl1y,2025-02-18T12:17:35,2

"The term ""pro-Israel"" is usually used to stand for one of two groups, depending on your inclinations or whether you believe the term ""pro-Israel"" can overlap with ""pro-Palestinian"":  - They believe Israel has the right to exist, and that actions against incidents such as October 7 are justified at least up to a certain point. This is not considered an ""unlimited right""- they don't think October 7 would justify the erasure of the Palestinian presence of Gaza for instance, never mind the killings of thousands who have little to nothing to do with the attacks- but they don't act as if they have no right to respond to an attack that killed a huge number of Israelis.  - Blind adherence to the idea of a One State Solution, as long as it is Israel, with the non-Israeli population (*Israel's citizenry includes many Muslims and Christians among others but no one discussing this thinks about that*) controlling the polity of the land. These people view anyone who doesn't give Israel the unlimited right to retaliate as being ""anti-Israel"" and view things like October 7th as proof of what happens when Israel *tolerates* the existence of certain Palestinian groups, never mind non-Israeli Arabs in the land as a whole. Put another way, they would put the head of Hamas and Joe Biden in the same bucket.  There are nuances of course, but this is generally what people mean by ""pro-Israel.""

Trump made a bad foreign policy move by abandoning the Kurds in Syria, and he left in protest of that.  John Bolton‚Äôs one of the untrustworthy examples. Trump fired him as national security advisor in 2019. He‚Äôs one of the people who called Trump ‚Äúunfit.‚Äù However, I don‚Äôt personally give much weight to that since the biggest schism between him and Trump was that Bolton was far more hawkish.

He then went on to make untold millions with his memoir slamming Trump, which sold nearly 800k copies in its opening week alone.  Pence, imo, is much more justified.

">  Before you answer - he‚Äôs not anti vaccine he just believes they should be fairly tried and tested   It is a conspiracy theory that we don't already do this, so I disagree with him on it. I think claiming we don't do this is intended to undermine public confidence in vaccines. [Here is the CDC's web page on the vaccine approval process.](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/basics/how-developed-approved.html) Additionally, Kennedy is the chair of Children's Health Defense. CHD includes quotes  such as the following: [The parallel between rising disease rates and the increasing number of childhood vaccines is hard to ignore.](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/vaccine-curriculum/).

"*sigh* here we still are. Sir, or ma‚Äôam, I never said I hate a Muslim or a conservative. A majority of my family is conservative and I don‚Äôt hate them at all. I don‚Äôt hate anyone. I don‚Äôt believe in hate. It is destructive and non productive. Once again, like I said, I have never been once turned down from entering any business, workplace, or establishment, due to my vaccination status. However, a private business is not the government. Under law, private business is technically private property, which means they can dictate who is allowed to enter their premises under circumstances they set. As a gun owner who publicly carries, there are many private businesses that will prohibit me from entering their business with a firearm on me so I will not enter those businesses because I respect their rules. Furthermore, I personally have not destroyed a single Tesla. And unless you want to be personally accused right now of destroying government property on January 6th like many conservatives did, I would put the paintbrush down. Now, back to the topic at hand. I said I stood for freedom and liberty and I still stand by that. Live your life, and no one else‚Äôs. You cannot be forced to work for someone you don‚Äôt want to work for. I just left my last job because I no longer wanted to work for who I worked for, you always have the freedom to leave, no matter who you are or who you work for. Also, the fear mongering of trans people is tired. The idea that trans women pose a specific threat to women in bathrooms is not supported by statistical evidence. Studies and reports from law enforcement agencies indicate that there is no widespread pattern of trans women attacking cisgender women in restrooms. In fact, most attacks of cisgender women in restrooms have been done by cisgender straight men following them in there. Research suggests that transgender individuals, particularly trans women, are more likely to be victims of violence rather than perpetrators. Therefore, it is vastly safer for those individuals to use the bathroom of the gender they associate with. Do you not care for those people‚Äôs safety at all? Just because you don‚Äôt understand them? Just because they freak you out by being different? The reason trans people want to use the bathroom of their choice is not to make a statement, it is for their own safety. A trans woman walking into a male restroom is taking a huge risk in regards to their own safety.   you‚Äôre comparing issues like public bathrooms and public restaurants and private businesses to issues of right to healthcare, right to personal liberty, and equal rights under law. That is apples to oranges. And at this point, I have said everything I need to say, this conversation has come to a standstill because I see my original question is not going to be answered by you here at this time.

"He is only weakening or defunding those aspects of the government that don't serve his own selfish purposes.  For instance, he wants to increase the military budget, and he is replacing those in command he deems not loyal enough to himself.  He has or will replace other agency heads, like the IRS and DOJ, with those who will do his bidding, so he can weaponize those agencies against his political opponents.  This is absolutely Autocracy 101.  Trump's Supreme Court picks are extreme and ideological to the point where they have undermined public confidence in the court.  They disregard past precedent and make up justifications for their rulings.  For instance, stating that the president has legal immunity if the crimes he commits were done during his official duties.  Some of the worst things he wanted to do in his first term were constrained by Republicans who were still loyal to our Constitution, but they have been taken out of power.  The old Republican party is dead, it is now a far-right party led by a wanna be dictator.  Those voters who think they want to live in an authoritarian regime will be disappointed, because there is no public accountability.  Such regimes are notoriously corrupt and they serve those in power at the expense of the well being of the average citizens.

"Of course we all are given that we are only allowed one perspective in this world; you can never truly live in someelse shoe.    Let me ask you this. Do you really think low income people have much of a choice in how much over time they work or consider tax implications on how many hours extra hours they work. Their income is low so their tax burden is also low so a tax cut on overtime while making $10-15/hour for lets say 10 hours of over time is what; 50-60 dollar.if they work at McDonald's for example, is their manager going to let them leave at 8 hours of overtime when their manager put 10 hours on the clock?",cdrcdr12,2024-09-14T10:28:38,2
"Okay so most people making 60 to 70,000 plus a year are salary so they don't get overtime mostly.  So who's mostly getting overtime pay, police officers and service workers.    Let's take the service worker example. The second largest employer in the US is Walmart (last time I saw the numbers). And they're starting pay is around $15 an hour average..   So let's just assume overtime pay is time and a half. So 15+ 15/2 =22.5  Their tax rate is probably around 20% and this income bracket, If they have a kid It's probably even less significantly less because they get to write off $5,000 for the kid. If it's two kids it's even more. But let's just stick it 20% which would be the high amount.  So for every hour of overtime they would  pay $4.50 in taxes in over time   So they will make $225 and pay $40.5 subtracted (so 180 with tax) from that to pay tax. So trump policy only saves them 40.5.   Now if they worked 8 hours instead they would make $180 and pay $36 in tax.   So yeah you are right that if the worker wants to make the same amount of money for working 8 with out tax for 10 hours with tax.  But they can also make an additional $45 working 10 hours with no tax, and if they're so desperate to do that with text then they're likely still be willing to do it without the tax",cdrcdr12,2024-09-14T12:38:03,2

"Here's the perspective of me, someone who likes Bernie quite a lot. It's not cognitive dissonance to like Bernie, think he's doing a good job, and still think he is too old for president/there should be age limits.   I have no issue with calling on Bernie to retire and for implementing term/age limits in Congress. I think the desire for age limits is twofold: Super old politicians risk their health inhibiting their ability to make decisions at critical times, and super old politicians are often out of touch with the issues and concerns of younger generations. That's not to say that younger politicians aren't out of touch with the issues of older generations, but I don't think we're at risk of Boomers' concerns being ignored anytime soon.  Bernie is in seemingly pretty decent shape despite his age. He was no Dianne Feinstein. And the reason a lot of young voters like him so much is that he absolutely was in touch with our needs, moreso than most other Democrats. So if we passed age limits and it forced him to retire, it'd be a sad but necessary consequence.",rowboat_mayor,2024-08-19T11:30:00,2

"> Voter turnout in 2020 was 160 million, and that's a number that is by definition at least engaged enough to vote, so I think a fair proxy for how many people would use their vouchers.  This election was, by a pretty wide margin, the highest turnout ever. Think it makes more sense to extrapolate how many people are engaged from the average election cycle. On top of that, it's not going to be even close to a 1:1 ratio of voters:donators. Yes people in swing states may make up some of the difference, but theres already a lot of variables here to be so certain. I'd also add that it doesn't really fix the problem so much as it kicks the can up stream. There will still be tons of dark money campaigns to influence how people spend their donation voucher, and dark money will still have a significantly larger seat at the table than someone with a donation voucher.

"> You still haven't answered the question, what crime was Trump trying to conceal when he claimed a campaign fee was a legal fee?  I answered it multiple times now. I'm not going to answer it again. It's clearly stated in the comment I made earlier and then quoted again because you have memory problems.  > So only when people donate more than allowed do they go to prison.  Did Trump donate more than allowed?   No, but Cohen did. Trump then tried to conceal Cohen's crime by disguising the reimbursements as payments for legal services that never occurred, because accurately recording what the payments were actually for would have revealed Cohen's campaign finance crime.

Before you try and lead me into the whole ""the jury didn't have to be unanimous"" thing: burglary is generally defined as unlawful entry into a residence with intent to commit another felony, and the jury doesn't have to be unanimous on what that underlying felony is either. If you break into somebody's house and some jury members think you were there to commit battery against the occupant while others think you were there to commit murder, you'll still get convicted because they all agree that you were there to commit some sort of felony. It works the same way in Trump's case.

I'm not sure I buy that she assumes sexism as the main reason for the spread of the Damsel trope.

She is aware it is a genre thing as well, that is¬† her given reason for its resurgence in indie games harkening back to the arcade era. She also takes on counterpoints, like the reverse-trope of women rescuing helpless men (she provides examples, but finds it really rare).

Sarkeesian doesn't think sexism is primarily ""women bad"", it's more ""women desirable, but incapable"". Taliban members probably think they're lovingly saving their valuable wives by keeping them locked in their houses.

I do think it was usually due to romantic interest, or close relation, or maybe being *magic* in a way that still gave them no power to act without help. It's something, but it is hardly material to build an independent identity with. As Sarkeesian says, games have made this point as a joke. Earthworm Jim has a princess called ""what's-her-name"".
