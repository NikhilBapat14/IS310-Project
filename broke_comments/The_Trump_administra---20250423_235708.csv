Except for doing everything planned in Project 2025  yeah. Totally unplanned.,kokopelleee,2025-04-24T00:46:48,34
"Partially. Trump himself is a bumbling moron, and may genuinely be succumbing to dementia. As has always been the case in his life, he is the weakest link in anything which involves him.  But behind the scenes, the oligarchs/ Project 2025 ghouls have been pretty effective. Trump’s pet project has been the tariffs and the petty vengeance stuff, but most of the rest of it has been Project 2025. And to their (dis)credit, they’ve done a lot of the harm they sought out to do.",Devilnaht,2025-04-24T01:16:44,22
"The problem is that the war on experts, the media and the assertion of deep-state conspiracies means that to his supporters, looking like you have no idea what you are doing means you are doing it right. Not like experts or experienced people - because they are the enemy - but like honest people making some mistakes as they enact the Will Of The People. And anyone saying otherwise is stating fake news. The more Trump messes up, the harder his fan base doubles down",slowover,2025-04-24T00:13:52,8
"As an American, I could not agree more. Also, the administration is also failing utterly as it is completely incompetent.",gunnergoz,2025-04-24T00:05:08,11

"Yep. It’s this “shoot from the hip”, cavalier attitude that’s going to turn the US into a “once was” great country. Who needs a plan when you’re a “genius”.",Luke_Cocksucker,2025-04-24T01:00:24,4

trump and his band of pusillanimous appeasers have NFI what they are doing. They just make shit up.,netsheriff,2025-04-24T00:06:50,3
"Why can’t he just do a boring, uneventful and predictably bad conservative agenda rather than… whatever the fuck this nonsense is? It would serve him better honestly, but then I have to imagine he is genuinely evil to some extent.",wrathmont,2025-04-24T01:13:37,3
"“Winging it” is Trump’s MO, and his ego likes to lead Dunning-Kruger around by the nose. It’s why he fucks everything up. He’ll take a perfectly planned business/policy decision (by a report/aide) and by making it his own (his changes) makes failure a certainty.",janzeera,2025-04-24T01:15:27,3

That what happens when your cabinet consists mainly of totally unqualified billionaires who bought their positions. There's something to be said for experience. The administration members can't be happy with how things are turning out. Trump needs an intervention and exiled to his gilded rococo and baroque Mar-a-Lago.,invalidpassword,2025-04-24T03:09:32,2

"And it works so well.  The democrat party doesn't know what to do, nothing they do can or will help them.  The inner party infighting outside of their owned sites like this one, bluesky, and others that show a united face is something I want to see so bad.       The democrats are the sick of man of America and the world.",Spiritual_Shower_514,2025-04-24T00:00:23,-18
"I read the title and said “no they’re not” out loud. I wish the media would stop pretending that incompetence has anything to do with this. They are clearly dismantling regulations in a malicious way, so they can horde money and enslave the American people worse.",ScaryJelly,2025-04-24T10:12:30,2
>but like honest people making some mistakes as they enact the Will Of The People.  Big difference between 'some mistakes' and NFI what they are doing.,netsheriff,2025-04-24T00:21:16,6
"Okay finally a someone coming in sounding like a bot off the Fox News comments. I’ve noticed more and more with broken English, and dropping words and using phrases not common in English for natives. I am wondering where these are originating from. The other day I saw a few of these people start arguing with each other and were calling each other names in I think Hebrew",Agreeable_Crow789,2025-04-24T00:05:37,9
"But if it goes wrong they just claim fake news, deep state or that Trump is playing 4D chess. Most Trump supporters dont think he has made any errors at all",slowover,2025-04-24T01:07:49,5
"Love ya :)     Anyway, your party is coming to an end.  The left's popularity with those under 30 has never been lower and the democrat party is in even worse shape.",Spiritual_Shower_514,2025-04-24T00:08:17,-11
">Most Trump supporters dont think he has made any errors at all  That is the really sad part. They are as thick as a brick.
