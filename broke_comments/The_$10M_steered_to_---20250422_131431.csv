"So, they sent... $10 million to the Hope Florida Foundation, a charity overseen by first lady Casey DeSantis.  The money was then sent to two nonprofit organizations that aren’t required to report how they spend their funds. Then...Those “dark money” groups later gave $8.5 million to a political committee overseen by DeSantis’ chief of staff in a series of transactions that some Republican lawmakers believe were illegal. No shit!  WOW stealing Medicaid money to spend however the hell you want.",SAJ-13,2025-04-22T13:25:18,64
