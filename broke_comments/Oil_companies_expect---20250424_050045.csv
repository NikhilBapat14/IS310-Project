Get in line behind everyone else who regrets. America will never forget and forgive that you voted for this government.,CheetahPatient6926,2025-04-24T05:03:10,33
"Oil companies expected a big business boom under Trump?  Jesus, they bought into Trump's bullshit too?  Does Trump have magical powers over slightly less than half of the population?  I just don't get it because us ""never Trumpers"" have ALWAYS seen this orange snake for what he is, a fat felonious buffoon of a conman.  I just don't understand how so many fell for Trump's big con, but then again, I am apparently pretty smart compared to the average dipshit Trumper.  My brain can't even slow down or get smooth enough to comprehend their level of stupidity.",RecommendationSlow16,2025-04-24T05:39:14,12
Anyone who expected a boom under Trump should buy some oceanfront property in Kansas from me.,The_Starving_Autist,2025-04-24T08:03:07,6
"Worried that they will only make hundreds of millions instead of billions? Don't worry oil tycoons, Trump will do everything he can to destroy the environment and all the safeguards that were put in place to give us clean air, clean water, clean soils, clean food, and allow the worst of the worst to destroy all of those things. Be patient, Trump is just getting started üò†",TopEagle4012,2025-04-24T05:29:20,5
The only downside to such amazing news is James Carville will encourage his handpicked candidate to be more pro-oil than the Republicans on the campaign trail.   But I will still always celebrate any harm the oil industry receives. No matter how small or unintentional.,papibigdaddy,2025-04-24T05:35:13,2
This is truly the most epic leopards eating faces situation.    When even the oil companies get fucked by a GOP President you know things have gone completely off the rails.,AaminMarritza,2025-04-24T07:17:02,2

"Here‚Äôs the truth.  20-40 % of a population will always believe whatever you tell them, and if given multiple options they choose the ‚Äúloudest statement‚Äù. Such statements are usually lies and or self serving alleviations from self recrimination. Essentially propaganda.  This isn‚Äôt a personal theory. This has been a known quantity since WWII but has been a practice since the mid-1800s.",User-Name-8675309,2025-04-24T05:45:57,10
