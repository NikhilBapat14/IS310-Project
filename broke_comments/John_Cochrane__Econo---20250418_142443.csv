"In a conversation at The Independent Institute, [Scott Atlas](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/scott-w-atlas) and [John Cochrane](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/john-h-cochrane) discuss economic challenges and opportunities facing the current White House. Cochrane and Atlas dive into the most controversial issues in economic policy today, including the Administration’s push to implement high tariffs on a wide range of US imports. The pair also consider the effects of deposit insurance in the US banking system; how the Fed can best respond to supply shocks; and the extent to which tariffs can effectively serve as a negotiating tactic for a country as large – and with as many global interests – as the United States. ",HooverInstitution,2025-04-18T14:25:01,2
