"Kids used to be a plus, they helped on the farm. If a kid survived past the years of high mortality, they were a financial asset. We now lives in concrete jungles off the farm and kids are now a financial liability, it costs money to have kids.

"It's the cost. At the highest point, we were paying 32k a year for two kids childcare. That doesn't include the extra costs that add to the thousands. We don't do enough as a country to incentivize natural births in this country and our politicians have found it easier to just open up immigration than address the elephant in the room. Male fertility rates have been plummeting which needs to be studied before it's irreversible. IVF is usually not covered by insurance so it's close to 30k out of pocket.",mahvel50,2025-04-22T13:41:36,57
"It's the cost of housing, healthcare, and child care (which is sort of tied directly to the other 2). We don't build enough houses/apartments, so it keeps supply low and prices high. This forces couples to delay children and both have to work full time, thus necessitating childcare. I don't know about other cities, but in mine anytime a developer wants to build housing they have to jump through every hoop imaginable, thus forcing them to only be able to build the giant houses instead of a bunch of smaller homes. This keeps supply lower than demand, and thus increases prices. Healthcare is the other issue, your average person can't even predict how much it'll cost them to actually have the baby, not to mention potential complications. So you delay and save, and then inevitably have less kids. The cost of housing/healthcare force both parents to work full time, which necessitates the expense of childcare. Which all build on each other.    Obviously you CAN navigate these things, but it's not intuitive for a lot of people, so a lot of people just give up.",mojo276,2025-04-22T11:16:54,22
"id like more kids but  1. i dont live near my parents (too expensive) house so we have no assist 2. my parents are still working in their late 60s  basically to have big fam you need a big fam.

"There needs to be incentives for having children.  Higher incomes (like even over 200k household, not the rich) get penalized even more as they don't get the full deduction so they're disincentivized even though they might be in a better position to raise children.  Taxing someone at a higher amount ""because they can afford it"" then refusing incentives for having children ""because they can afford it"" creates disincentive for having a family.  Shocker.    IVF should be a tax credit and everyone should get the full amount, again, middle class is penalized more than working poor as if they're at professional salary they again can't even deduct the full amount which right now is only a deduction.  Fertility has plummeted, a lot of people are trying to have families but can't, we don't know the cause of this rise of infertility but we need to take drastic steps right now to address it, they need help.  Every year is fewer babies.     Were staring down the barrel of demographic collapse by 2060 from what I read.  You're going to have a lot of elderly people and no young people to provide services, at some point it will be impossible to fill jobs, costs will skyrocket, good luck finding specialists.    I think this should be the most pressing issue today as we're facing a future with few young people. It takes decades to rebuild a population, so every year we sit on our hands it will worsen.  Also the culture needs to shift towards pro-family, the modernist assault on having a family needs to stop, it has had a part in leading people to this point.  Promote having children and normalize it.",codifier,2025-04-22T11:03:27,140

Extremely stressful time, but I luckily got a remote job almost right away, which was a different kind of stress. Very little sex drive during the worst days of that time.

Blaming this solely on economics and ignoring social influences is a mistreat  Poor people have kids at rates higher than the rich. People in much poorer countries have kids. People had kids throughout history in even worse conditions than that.   Honestly if you could pick a time and place to have a child in the past 300 years now in the US would be near the top (yes I'm sure there are a few times you think would be easier)  The values of America have changed,_Diggus_Bickus_,2025-04-22T11:05:42,90

"All big purchases are a part of this.  Housing, transportation, Healthcare, education, childcare, the associated taxes and especially the insurance have all spiked relative to wages.    Its been getting progressively worse since about 1973, but massively spiked in the lates 70s/ early 80s(the end of when gen x was being born) and never recovered to 1970s levels(instead continuing to get slowly worse despite Regean coming in to fix the worst excesses),  and it massively spiked again with Covid. Ideally there's time for that to recover if the economy catches up to the covid inflation, but with Boomers liquidating their investments and flooding cash into everything for retirement, while we are simultaneously printing more money than ever to keep up with the rising net cost of funding their entitlements, its likely to continue to get worse in the short term.   But its almost like rapid inflation is bad for everyone not trying to pay off low interest rate loans on their appreciating assets.

I live outside a growing city and everyone complains about the cost of housing, but no one wants to vote to let more housing get built.

It always surprised me how conservatives are just as much to blame for this, if a farmer wants to sell his field to a developer it should be his business.

"People say this about the schedule preventing kids, but when I think about how the average family size in the 1950s was 3.7 kids (compared to 1.7 today) but the average *white collar job* PTO was 1-2 weeks of vacation time per year, and only 1 year for blue collar jobs (earned after a year of work)... And no formalized sick day systems...  There's gotta be something else at play beyond inflexible schedules contributing to smaller families as today.  I mean shit, families made it work with more children and less time off in the past, so you'd think we'd be able to manage it today as well if we really wanted it.  Edit: of course, this was a time when 70% of families were single income, so that probably has a lot to do with it.",Shadeylark,2025-04-22T14:24:43,-19

">Sure kids might have smart phones and other relative luxuries now  Also worth noting - is a smart phone *really* a luxury these days? People need to be honest. Ready access to the internet is practically a prerequisite to participate in the modern economy. Very few employers (very few *good* ones where you can build a career anyway) do paper applications. It's all online. The ""walk in and ask for a job"" days are over, and have been over for nearly 20 years at this point no matter how much older people (who haven't been on a job hunt in just as long) don't want to accept it as reality. Is the latest and greatest iPhone Pro Max a necessity? No. Is a smartphone that is decent enough to access most websites and run apps without crashing a necessity? I would say absolutely yes.  Thanks to Amazon killing all the competition, there are a lot of things you may need to purchase that you can really only get online - ESPECIALLY if you want to live like our grandparents did and repair things instead of replacing them. Go try to find me a replacement motor for my washing machine from the early 2000s without the internet. Go on, try. Try to get parts to repair a car without the internet. You CAN, but you're going to pay considerably more money than someone who shops online.  Even groceries - if Kroger has bought out your local grocery chain (and they probably have since they've bought most of them at this point) you're going to be taking an absolute screw on almost everything in the store unless you have their digital coupons. So even in cases where you CAN get by without easy internet access, it's going to be a more expensive life. This is what finally forced my grandma to get a phone. Kroger bought out Pick 'n Save and suddenly she really didn't have access to affordable groceries without one.  The realities of the economy for young people are somewhere between what the hardcore leftoids and the out-of-touch baby boomers think. Young people do have a lot of excess that could be trimmed from their budget, and the cost of living being high doesn't mean that they should refuse to even try to trim that fat. But the cost of living is high and there's no getting around that. Everything is more expensive than it used to be and there are new categories of expenses for things that I would argue are needs and not wants which previous generations didn't have to deal with.",homestar92,2025-04-22T15:57:28,54

"My dad had me late in life, and I'm in my 40's now. He grew up in the 1930's and 40's in rural WV. He didn't have his first pair of shoes until he was 6. Like the old joke, he actually did walk barefoot to a single schoolhouse with wood heat. He didn't feel air conditioning until he was an adult and could work me into the ground in his 70's. He knew what actual hunger felt like.  I grew up living on food stamps in rural Arkansas, and even I know little of what being *really* poor is, and my son knows none of it. Looking at access to air conditioning, literacy and entertainment, average living sq ft per person, life expectancy, hunger/starvation rates, caloric intake, manual labor job percentages etc. etc. etc. life is simply way, way better now.   Even to feign poverty in the US we have to make up new metrics like ""food insecurity"". People just want to pretend to have it difficult despite living in the most peaceful and propserous time and place in all of human history and saw the most dramatic increase in living standards that any people have ever experienced.",AccidentProneSam,2025-04-22T13:53:48,29

Start by examining the cost of a college degree. There was a time when one could get a Harvard education and pay for it on a minimum wage job.  There was also a time when a Harvard education was worth something.,Imissyourgirlfriend2,2025-04-22T14:11:35,24
"The biggest expenses can be simply avoided by asking grandma, aunt, neighbor, whoever to watch the kids, and letting them stay home starting at 3rd grade or so on. Not everyone has family or friends to watch kids but it's also like it's not culturally acceptable for white people anymore. All of the immigrants I've run into have no problem finding childcare. It's something the other family members *want* to do. The white side of my family was like this when I was a kid but not so much anymore. Everyone for themselves and ""if you can't afford a vacation, you can't afford a kid"" mentality.",Energy_Turtle,2025-04-22T14:53:04,3

"Oh, don’t worry, we’ll eventually get communism as people get more firmly entrenched in the “I should have a luxury lifestyle and ample money for a home and 2 kids and a dog with a stay at home wife” entitlement. They *want* it, so the world owes it to them. Obviously, they won’t get that under collectivism either, but they’ll feel real successful and optimistic for a few months before the bread lines start.   But today, in reality, it is simple for most people: blow money on trivial things and enjoy convenience and luxury, or have the means to have children and build a family. You can dislike it and think its wrong and cry about it, but those are your choices - as we literally see today with many of the people who “can’t afford” to start families.",EchoKiloEcho1,2025-04-22T18:44:50,-2

"The inflation adjusted median income for GPs in Germany is just 6700€ before taxes in Germany. Adjusted for inflation that is half of what they earned in the 1970s. Dentists earn between 1/3rd and 1/5th of what they earned in the 1970s.   Social Healthcare is bad for doctors. I am an achieved computer scientist and I earn more than 90% of Germans. I will never be able to afford a home of my own where I live. The housing price more than quadrupled in comparison with inflation adjusted wage growth.  Mandatory social insurance (a bad deal) also increased heavily. I pay 50% tax on my income, and I pay 19% VAT on everything I buy.   I‘m not saying this is the case for everyone, but it‘s really frustrating. The major cause for this is overregulating the building market though. Can‘t build because the city offers no plots.",WillGibsFan,2025-04-22T15:23:50,7
"Fair enough but further to my point, I asked Grok to make the calculations for paying for a Harvard education in 1942 while working a minimum wage job of the day to right now.  In 1942, it would've taken around 3080 hours to pay off your time at Harvard whereas today, that same accomplishment would take over 12,000 hours at minimum wage. The main differences being that back in 1942, a Harvard education got you places.  It's not so much about education or college degrees; I'm pointing out that they didn't have to spend as much as we are now.",Imissyourgirlfriend2,2025-04-22T14:56:02,12

You weren't getting admitted to Harvard unless you were well-connected or you were receiving a merit-based scholarship of some kind. 2.

"It's not about what anyone can afford on a minimum wage. I made that selection as a baseline data point. It'd be rather stupid to compare any cost from one point in history to another if you are going to say, ""For the 1942 scenario, use the income data for the top 23% and the income data for today use the bottom earners."" Referencing the minimum wage from both timeframes as a comparison shows that the cost of things from 1942 to now went up dramatically while the minimum wage stayed almost stagnant.",Imissyourgirlfriend2,2025-04-22T15:18:02,7
