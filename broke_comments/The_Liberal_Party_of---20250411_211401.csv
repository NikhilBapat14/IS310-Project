"It is a combination of things.  * Occupying the natural centre of the Canadian political landscape (currently considered to be centre-left on the political spectrum which of course varies by country and over time)  * Having more of their popularity based in the larger population centres of Ontario and Quebec whereas their main opposition--the Conservative party--having more of their base in the less-populated Prairie provinces.  The Conservatives as a result have a less efficient vote conversion into seats in Parliament because they run up the score in a few areas but then don't score as well in many, many more areas.  * Having a number of leaders who were some combination of liked, politically skilled, and successful and thus had long periods in power.  Laurier, King, Pierre Trudeau, Chretien/Martin, Justin Trudeau.",ptwonline,2025-04-12T08:46:55,42
"Also in the last 10 years the Cons have nominated some very unpopular leaders, who had trouble gaining popularity in vote rich Ontario and Quebec. Conservative policy has also not convinced the electorate that they won’t roll back protection on abortion, gay marriage/rights, and environmental policies.",No-Chain1565,2025-04-12T08:55:44,21

"They're Canada's prime big tent party. They can be progressive when they want to be, but they largely stick to the center, so they don't scare away too many voters who might otherwise be afraid of progressive politics. They've also just been around a long time so they have plenty of name recognition, and they're also responsible for most of the progress that Canada made over the last century, particularly under Pierre Trudeau.  By contrast, UK society (and media, let's not forget media) is a bit more conservative than Canada's, so the Conservative Party has a sort of built-in advantage with the voters. Ironically, it's the Tories who are best at evolving with the times—they went from being the party of the aristocrats, to the party of market and business people, to the populist party of today; they've got a broad coalition of UK society. On the other hand, the Labour Party of the UK has too much internal strife; they don't really know what they want, and they can't ever be happy with any successes they have. Just look at how they treat their most successful leader of the last several decades (Tony Blair). Does that seem like a party that wants to win elections? They're their own worst enemy.  I don't know enough about Australian politics to comment on them (mainly because I don't really think about them at all), but I would assume it's a similar situation there to the UK",AntarcticScaleWorm,2025-04-12T02:02:55,8
Many of the progressive policies in Canada were accomplished by Liberal minority governments that required NDP support to govern. The liberals needed to move forward NDP goals in order to remain in power. This includes national healthcare and the adoption of the Canadian flag.,AM_Bokke,2025-04-12T08:17:56,9
"The liberals are the safe middle road; basically socially progressive conservatives. So they’ll campaign with lip service to the environment, indigenous rights, marginalized communities, unions and workers. Then get elected and bow to Bay Street anyway, pushing through pipelines on unceded territory or without environmental review or cut taxes for wealthy Canadians, or implement sketchy back room deals for their wealthy party donors - just as any other conservative might.  Liberals governments - or any Canadian government for that matter, work best when they are forced into coalitions with other parties.  The Trudeau government, despite being smeared perpetually across social media, actually got quite a bit done for regular Canadians, but only because they needed NDP support to get anything passed.",pomod,2025-04-12T11:24:01,7
"Wasn’t the modern conservative party formed only like 30 years ago from the remains of the progressive conservatives? The splitting of the conservative majority parties could be a part of it.  Also, I think I remember JJ McCollough explaining that the Liberal Party tends to be viewed as the more nationalist party, so maybe that has something to do with it?",Ana_Na_Moose,2025-04-12T01:33:33,3
"Ultimately it comes down to the fact that the Liberal Party is the master of the pivot. Something they can do because of the three party system in Canadian politics. Or the ""two-party plus"" system as it is sometimes called because the NDP don't totally count.   The Liberal party, because of their position in the political middle, can pivot to be more left wing, more right wing, whatever they feel the need to do given the current climate. Just look at Carney now vs Trudeau. Trudeau took the party left from his predecessor, a formula that worked reasonably well, albeit not perfectly. As the winds of change started blowing, the Conservatives got more and more popular, eventually Carney shows up on the scene. The first things he does are actually Conservative policies. Removed the carbon tax, starts talking up nationalist talking points, promises increased military spending, and promotes the Canadian energy industry in the campaign. Things Trudeau, despite leading the same party, could or would never do.   The strategy is twofold. One, in the case of literally copying opposition policies, you remove that ammunition from them. Second, you get to steal the votes that that program or policy was generating for the opposition.",notpoleonbonaparte,2025-04-12T19:48:00,2
"Canadian psychology is generally liberal in outlook.  The Liberal party manages to capture that in most of its messaging and themes.  It's a ""good enough"" party that we just default to most of the time.  The red colour themes help because people subconsciously associate it with the colour of our flag.",---Spartacus---,2025-04-13T05:55:39,2
"The Liberals are often considered the ""default"" Canadian party. They are the ones that gave us Universal Healthcare, Legalized Weed, Legalized Gay Marriage, etc.   Just about every single time Canada has taken a step forward, it's been the Liberal Party working the legs.",Puncharoo,2025-04-13T04:21:55,2
"There has been more party instability on the conservative side, while the Liberals have been more of a big tent party.  Canadian politics are regionalized / Balkanized.  The conservatives dominate the prairies.  The Liberal party has generally maintained Ontario as a stronghold for federal elections, and that's where a substantial number of the seats are located.  In recent years, the formation of the separatist Bloc Quebecois has had a greater spoiler effect for the conservatives than for the Liberals.  The populations of the ""ridings"" (districts / constituencies) does not align with the distribution of the popular vote.  Conservatives have won popular vote pluralities in some recent elections yet the Liberals win the most seats.  Canada does not require coalition governments, so the party that wins the most seats will select the prime minister.",I405CA,2025-04-12T09:11:44,1
"Liberal Party has gotten lucky, largely due to unforced errors by opposition on both sides.  The NDP shooting itself in the foot throughout the mid-to-late-2010s didn't help any, nope.  And Charlie Angus, not Jagmeet Singh, should've won NDP leadership election back in 2017.",NoExcuses1984,2025-04-13T18:24:34,1

"The modern day Canadian Conservative party was a merging of the remains of the Progressive Conservative party and the Western Canadian Alliance party (previously the Reform Party). Federally the PCs were decimated in the 1993 election where they went from 156 seats (a majority government) to 2. They never recovered. The PCs still exist in provincial politics.  The Canadian Liberals have traditionally been a centre left party and the old PCs were centre right. The Conservatives are further right and keep moving more right. They are more a western party than a national one. The Atlantic provinces tend to be majority liberal, Quebec is either Liberal or the regional Bloc Quebecois and and the Praires are Conservative (especially Alberta). BC tends to the left. Elections in Canada are won or lost in Ontario because of the number of seats there.   Canadians are more left leaning, particularly with social issues. Also since 1993 the Liberals are the biggest tent - NDP are seen as too left, Conservatives are seen as a western party and too right and the Bloc are only Quebec. The liberals did go further left under Trudeau but seem to have gone back towards centre with Carney.",larla77,2025-04-12T09:49:32,7

">Wasn’t the modern conservative party formed only like 30 years ago from the remains of the progressive conservatives?  Sure, but it still begs the question why a conservative coalition in general (whether that's modern or past conservative parties) have not been able to break the Liberal dominance. In Australia, there's a coalition between the centre-right Liberal and National parties to form government at the federal level that have been historically very successful.  >the Liberal Party tends to be viewed as the more nationalist party,  Is there a reason why? Trudeau/Carney don't really scream nationalist to me.",Illustrious-Pound266,2025-04-12T11:45:08,1
So why does the Conservative party fail to do the pivot successfully unlike the Liberals? It's not like they have to be so rigid or fixed in policies.,Illustrious-Pound266,2025-04-12T21:48:52,2
"> Elections in Canada are won or lost in Ontario because of the number of seats there.   Well, and because Ontario + Quebec have just about as many seats between them as the rest of the country put together. But that's just one of the many complaints I have with the current Canadian system.  Re: the NDP though, it's less that they're too far left and more that they've got a twofold issue of leadership and reach. By reach I mean they don't even have candidates running in a lot of ridings, but you can guarantee there'll be a Liberal and a Conservative in every single one. And their (very popular to this day) former leader Jack Layton died at an extremely bad time when it looked like they were going to make a major electoral breakthrough. Thomas Mulcair I...honestly don't know enough to comment on, but he didn't last. And Jagmeet Singh has completely torched his own credibility, and very possibly his party's, by propping up Trudeau over the past six-eight months while his poll numbers cratered.",FrozenSeas,2025-04-12T14:11:05,1

The Canadian conservatives are tied to the social conservative religious right and political extremists like the Alberta separatists and convoy revolutionaries that are repellant to suburban Ontario and Quebec.,Mirageswirl,2025-04-12T12:20:21,5
Carney has definitely been going on a nationalist (or at least patriotic) spree talking up how he feels Canada is superior to America for reasons x y and z,Ana_Na_Moose,2025-04-12T13:15:41,2
"Sometimes they do. Unfortunately they have the same problem the NDP do in that there are a segment of hardliners that exist on either end of the Overton window of Canadian politics that form one of their core voter groups. That keeps the party loosely anchored to a set of values and policy that is very slow and difficult to change. If they push too hard to the left, they alienate this core group and start a schism within the party. Reform is an example of this, and a less dramatic is what happened to Erin O'Toole.",notpoleonbonaparte,2025-04-12T21:58:53,4
"Because they can't pivot to the left like the Liberals can. Liberals can be progressive or conservative when they need to be. Conservatives are only Conservative and Slightly More Conservative.  The reason Carney is killing it right now is because he is the Socially Progressive, Fiscally Conservative Unicorn that conservative party have been searching for for years.its been kind of this running joke - will the CPC be able to find the Unkcorn they need to finally win the votes away from Justin Trudeau???   The comedy here is that Yes, they did find him, but he joined the Liberal Party. And not only that, but they aren't fighting against Justin Trudeau anymore, they're fighting against the very Unicorn they were searching for.",Puncharoo,2025-04-13T04:32:46,3
Ontario and Quebec account for roughly 61% of Canada's population. in fact rhe greater toronto area has roughly 2 million more people then the entire province of Alberta.
