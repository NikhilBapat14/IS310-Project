I think they are concentrating power.  Trump was annoyed the first go around that he wasn't able to do a lot of things due to the large federal bureaucracy that has checks on most actions. Now? He wants to do whatever he wants and so firing and/or eliminating agencies that stood in his way the first time is his top priority.  This has nothing to do with efficiency or spend reduction. It has everything to do with concentration of power into the Oval Office.,ballmermurland,2025-03-29T16:48:55,458
"All you need to find an answer is to compare what he's doing with [what happened during the Clinton administration.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Partnership_for_Reinventing_Government)  You see, when the professionals get together and do a job, people hardly even notice. Despite that, they managed a positively massive reduction in government.  What Trump is doing isn't reducing government. He's playing shock and awe tactics while he concentrates power in the office of the president.",cromethus,2025-03-29T17:08:05,65

"Trump is about vengeance. Any one department or individual who wronged him will face his wrath. The question of if he is shrinking the size of government or concentrating power can be answered with BOTH. He is shrinking the size of the government to concentrate power within the executive branch. Remember, Republicans want to run this country like a company, which of course requires a super powerful board and executive that doesn't answer to anyone. He wants to be Putin or Orban, guys who he is buddy buddy with. Companies are run like authoritarian regimes. Don't forget that.",Cockblocktimus_Pryme,2025-03-29T17:18:05,10
"He's absolutely concentrating power. He dropped 100 executive actions already this year, nearly one a day. If you start reading through them you'll see a lot of them are restating existing law in parts, but portraying it as though he is making these laws anew. Its a ploy to create the appearance of greater power for the Executive. When things keep going like they have for years, now with the context that Trump ""ordered it,"" they will be able to claim those orders were actually the reason and make more of the public *believe* he has the power to make these things happen. You'll also find a lot of things that are not enforceable in the orders, but will still be done because the entity being compelled is on team Trump.   The rest of the content in the orders, at least the majority of them, are not within the power of the President. They'll of course be argued that they are, some will get through, some will never even be acknowledged. The point is not for these orders to actually matter or be followed. The point is to normalize an extreme amount of executive action. 100 orders in 100 days is *unheard of.* that's half as many as his entire first term, which already broke records.   Beyond that, we're seeing an increase in Presidential power hitherto undreampt of in the United States. Immunity from criminal acts is insane, and something that would have saved Nixon from resignation. The normalizing of executive orders outside the scope of executive power is very concerning. With a House and Senate in his corner, and a Supreme Court more often in his corner than not (though honestly they've been just and stood against him a lot more than I expected, especially Barret and Roberts), its unlikely that he'll be challenged much in creating this precedent for power.   The ultimate goal is clearly to shift law making and interpretation away from Congress and into the Executive Office. They want to consolidate federal power in one branch of government. It seems like they want to dump Marbury v. Madison and make the Supreme Court just another Court of Appeals again, and they want to relegate Congress to a collection of committees for recommending laws instead of actually creating them. They want to make the President the power house of the cell, the lifeline of the Federal Government. They basically want to take the federalism out of the Federal Government.",Kungfudude_75,2025-03-29T20:17:59,8
"I don't think Trump himself has that much of a plan. But he is surrounded by people with plans. The Project 2025 guys are writing most of the executive orders and they literally have a written manifesto. The tech billionaires have plans, and some of their objectives overlap with some of the Project 2025 plans. There are the racists like Stephen Miller who has plans to get rid of as many brown people as he can. His plans overlap with some of the Project 2025 plans.  Trump wants to make money, do something he believes will make him be considered one of the great American presidents, and play golf. That's part of his desire to expand American territory.

So you are basically calling for congress to pass laws that stop executive orders? Taking away some of the checks and balances that our government is founded on? Each branch has the ability to reign in the others for certain reasons.  What you are asking is that Congress should strip the president of the powers of the executive office?   All that because of your blind hatred of Trump?  And I bet when the table turns and a democrat is the president and the congress is Republican you want the president to have those powers back?,One_Recognition_4001,2025-03-31T16:47:54,-1
"and you are insisting that something is there that is not while also just playing on a vague idea that ""project 2025 is a bad thing"" when people who've read it are like ""this is pretty sensible and good""",MurrayBothrard,2025-03-30T08:35:14,-1

"> Thank you for once again demonstrating how conservatives argue.  Sure, by pointing out that the document you cited has the budget for the employees that are hired.  But that wasn't the question or point of this.   A budget is not Congress saying how many employees each department and each division of that department must have.  A budget for the department is based on the request of each department for how many people they need to achieve their purpose.   It is not Congress demanding the number of employees but the department requesting funding for how many employees they need.  These departments now require fewer funds for fewer employees  So yes, facts and logic are the standard.  If you cannot understand that very simple distinction and why your assertion is just plain wrong you should go back and slap your professors.  > If you think you're serving your arguments well, please, continue arguing that U.S. courts don't have jurisdiction over U.S. citizens abroad.   I swear reading comprehension is a rare things these days with some people.   What is the jurisdiction of a federal district judge?   You haven't been able to understand what jurisdiction means let alone that a district judge is the lowest level of federal judge and their rulings do not apply outside of that word jurisdiction.    Is there any reason that you could think of why when Boasberg asked for more details on where the planes were when he gave his order might apply to his ""jurisdiction""?",Funklestein,2025-03-30T00:37:09,0
Bruh... Look at my post history. Blindly hating Trump ain't exactly what I'm known for.   The powers of which I speak are those that RESIDE IN CONGRESS and that they outsource to the Oval. It's not an abuse of power or removal of a check and balance to take their constitutional power back.,RumLovingPirate,2025-03-31T16:54:14,2
"it literally spells out entire sections of executive orders, with the intent to ""to decentralize and privatize as much as possible.""   The only people who think Project 2025 is “sensible” are people aligned with the Heritage Foundation. Actual experts think it’s a recipe for disaster and chaos. Which is what we’ve seen so far and will continue to see.   I'm done discussing with people who do not read.",AverageUSACitizen,2025-03-30T09:17:30,6

">Sure, by pointing out that the document you cited has the budget for the employees that are hired.  But that wasn't the question or point of this.  Yes, that was indeed the point.  But you pretend otherwise. As your ideology demands you must.  >You haven't been able to understand what jurisdiction means let alone that a district judge is the lowest level of federal judge and their rulings do not apply outside of that word jurisdiction.  Oh, I understand plenty. But, again, you pretend otherwise, because you must. And then you toss in insults because you know you cannot allow the conversation to be about facts for too long.  >Is there any reason that you could think of why when Boasberg asked for more details on where the planes were when he gave his order might apply to his ""jurisdiction""?

"Agreed.  You are so stuck in your ideology that reason doesn’t make sense to you anymore.   Departments request money for numbers of employees.  Budgets are not made by Congress to set levels of staff.    Federal district judges have jurisdiction over there districts, not the entire country nor overseas.

">You are so stuck in your ideology that reason doesn’t make sense to you anymore.   Amusing to claim, as you argue in defense of an ideology that cannot tolerate good faith or reason.  >Departments request money for numbers of employees.  Budgets are not made by Congress to set levels of staff.    Yes, in fact they are - as demonstrated in the citation I already provided.  But, of course, your ideology cannot tolerate inconvenient facts, so...  >Federal district judges have jurisdiction over there districts, not the entire country nor overseas.    Yes, in fact, they do - as two hundred years of judicial history demonstrate. Even if that history grates on you.  >This things are axiomatic but yet you believe otherwise without reasoning.  ""Axiomatic"" does not mean ""things I wish were true.""  And documented history and facts already provided to you are not ""without reasoning.""  You are endlessly entertaining, though.
