"The Tennessee Star learned on Wednesday that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an alleged member of the Central American gang Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) who was deported to El Salvador under President Donald Trump amid legal action claiming the removal was by mistake, was suspected of being engaged in human trafficking by a Tennessee Highway Patrol (THP) officer who detained him in December 2022, leading the THP to contact the FBI for guidance. Within two hours, the FBI ultimately requested the THP release Garcia and the passengers in his vehicle. THP complied with the request.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-17T01:36:58,27
"Woman and child abuser.  ---  >Kilmor Alvego Garcia PETITION FOR PROTECTION/PEACE ORDER CONTINUATION SHEET  >I told him to give me his card to pay, he got angry, start insulting me, I only put a few of gas, once leaving there he pulled out like crazy. I started recording because I was scared of the way he was driving and b/c our 8 year old was in the back sit. In the recording you can hear him yelling, insulting me, driving extreme fast. On 5/04/2021 @ 2:00 I was watching on my laptop and he yelled to turn it off, I told him I wasn't sleepy, he got angry, (reached over) shut and threw my laptop on the floor, and the baby started to cry because he was putting pressure on him, my immediate reaction was to push him off of us, and he then punched, scratched me on my left eye, leaving me bleeding. That same day @ 2:00pm he came home, and to say he was going out with friend, I told him that I needed to go out to pick some orders @ BJ’s, he got angry, started yelling again to the point that he rip my shorts and shirt off and I ran to the bathroom, he ranned behind me grabbed me by my arm. I have 2 marks on my left arm as well. He then left came home @ 10:00pm. I left my car parked in the neighborhood, and in the morning I asked him for the key and said he wasn’t going to give it to me b/c he had things to do. I order Uber to leave with my kids b/c I be scared of him, minutes later he called that our car wasn’t there anymore. At this point I am afraid to be close to him. I have multiple photos/videos of how violate he can be. and all the bruises he has left me. The children with me.  >3/5/2021   ---",Highwiind-D4,2025-04-16T21:52:11,34
