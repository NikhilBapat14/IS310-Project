"I've read many people say that Pope Francis made the Catholic Church more ""inclusive"". Inclusive of what? I feel that he tried to make sinners more comfortable living in sin. When I hear that Pope Francis was beloved by progressive Catholics I shutter, knowing what the people of progressive movements advocate, like his acceptance of the LGBTQ+ movement. Pope Francis may be right that homosexuality is not a crime (at least in most parts of the world) but it is a sin. In the eyes of God, sin is sin, and it will not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. I reject anybody who wishes to water down and try to change the meaning of sin. I'm a sinner. I know what sin is. I know that the life I currently live is not in accordance with God's law and the teachings of Christ. I want do better, I need to do better, I have to do better.

Well, I think then what you're doing is less about the teachings of Christ and more about the glorification of yourself.

We are instructed to draw near to God (James 4:8) and Jesus tells us to seek closeness by abiding in him because He loves us (John 15:4-9)  His word states that through faith we receive the Spirit of adoption that makes all believers children of God, **God’s children even to the point of being co-heirs with Christ** (Romans 8:15-17)  You are right, we are not equal with God!….not even close. We are less than filth compared to His holiness and righteousness. There is no comparison! And the fact that He loves us and calls us His children and wants us to draw near and seek Him with all of our hearts ANYWAY, so He can abide in us and us in Him…..glorifies God more than just about anything else ever could.

"Catholics fully agree that Jesus is the true foundation of the Church, as stated in 1 Corinthians. But Matthew 16 is not about replacing Christ. It is about Jesus giving Peter a real leadership role. When Jesus says, “You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my Church,” He is not making a pun for effect. He is appointing Peter. In Aramaic, the word for Peter and rock is the same—Kepha.  Jesus also gives Peter the keys to the kingdom, which is a reference to royal authority from Isaiah 22. This is not symbolic. It is a clear transfer of responsibility. Peter is not divine. He is the steward that Christ appointed.  Throughout Scripture, Peter leads with authority given by Christ. In John 21, Jesus tells him to feed His sheep. In Acts, Peter speaks first and leads the early Church.  So Catholics are not ignoring Scripture. They believe Christ is the cornerstone and that He chose Peter to be the visible leader of His Church. This is not a contradiction. It is how Christ chose to build His Church.",soupdawg,2025-04-21T09:49:19,17

"I’m not ignoring context. I’m taking the full context of Scripture into account, not just a single passage. Jesus is the one who singles Peter out in Matthew 16 by changing his name, declaring him the rock, and giving him alone the keys to the kingdom. This moment is unique and personal. The other apostles later receive the authority to bind and loose in Matthew 18, but only Peter is given the keys, which in Jewish tradition signify a chief steward role as seen in Isaiah 22:22. That is not something Jesus did lightly or by accident.  Quoting Matthew 6:24 about serving two masters does not apply here. Catholics do not serve Peter. We serve Christ alone. Peter was a servant and a leader chosen by Christ. That does not take away from Christ’s role as Lord. It reflects how Jesus established visible leadership for His Church.  Yes, Paul rebuked Peter in Galatians. That shows Peter was human and imperfect, not that he lacked authority. Leaders can be corrected, but that does not erase their role. In fact, the fact that this correction was recorded shows the Church was committed to truth, not blind loyalty.  The Great Commission was given to all the apostles and, through them, to the Church. But that does not cancel Peter’s unique responsibility. In John 21, Jesus personally and directly tells Peter three times to feed His sheep. That was not a general statement. It was a charge.  So to be clear, Catholics do not place Peter above Christ. We believe Christ is the Head of the Church. We also believe He appointed Peter as a visible shepherd to guide it.

"You're literally forgiven after completing confession, your forgiveness isn't withheld if you don't complete the assigned penance from the priest. Its intended purpose is to hold oneself accountable and to lead your heart back to God, showing you do in fact have sincerity in the confession you just committed.      You're not dead if alive with God in heaven, I loathe when people constantly talk about salvation this or that and yet when the topic of heaven and the saints come up suddenly being in heaven means you're dead and any form of communication is severed.

"The problem is these traditions most certainly contradict and defy scripture. Again, arrogant humans throughout history have thought that they know how to follow God better than He explicitly instructs us to, or that humans can improve upon God’s design lol.  Confession to humans is Biblical for accountability purposes, confession and repentance to God himself through Christ is the only way you receive forgiveness of sins (biblically speaking). Pardon me if I mistake some of the smaller idiosyncrasies of the Catholic tradition that contradict scripture, but a contradiction is a contradiction. Christ is mediator for forgiveness, that power rests there and nowhere else. You do not go to another human for any part of the forgiveness aspect of confession, again that is biblical for the purpose of accountability and having brothers/sisters helping to shepherd you back on track. (It’s quite interesting though how the majority of Catholic traditions always find a way to give more power and authority to the Church by placing themselves in-between their members and God. How convenient!)   Then, again yes while spiritually alive, that doesn't alter the fact you are praying to non-deities instead of to God through Christ as Christ and the apostles instruct us to. The Lord’s Prayer was Jesus’ response when the disciples asked Christ, how do we pray. Christ says multiple times in the Gospel of John to come to the Father  and make requests through His name. Christ is the sole mediator no one comes to the Father but through Him. The purpose of Him dying on the cross was to be the ultimate sacrifice for all of our sins as Savior so we could be restored to God through Him for the rest of our time on earth and eternity. He is our mediator and intercessor to God for everything spiritual. Christ describes He and the Father as being One, to the point where Christ is then described as the Lord of all Creation along with the Father….why the heck would you even want another when that is who wants and who has always been intended to be your mediator and intercessor? There is not only simply no scripture permitting praying to anyone in Heaven but God through Christ for intercession, but scripture outright contradicts it. Praying to saints (as well as designating/venerating patron saints) was a token concession to get former polytheist pagans across Europe to warm up to the idea of the church in the 4th and 5th century. Show me in the Word of God where praying to God through others or for intercession from others aside from Christ is justified, because thinking you need or should ever want a mediator/intercessor aside from the Son of God is not only blasphemous, it is antithetical to and detracts from the entire Gospel message of Christ’s sacrificial death and resurrection and our redemption and restoration unto the Father through Him",NeedsMoreHorsepower,2025-04-22T19:59:54,0

"Christ literally told the apostles in John 20, specifically verses 19 to 23, that they may forgive and retain sins on his behalf, even breathing on them the Holy Spirit to do so, telling them if they do not forgive their sins they would not be forgiven, but sure, confession was only to Jesus and anything else is unbiblical.      You provided absolutely nothing that had shown catholicism contradiction the scripture, which again, I might add, was compiled through the church itself and is the reason you even have the western rite canon to begin with, very odd that the church that you claim contradicts scripture didn't edit said scripture to better align with the teachings that you view as contradictory.      Again showing how you weren't ever a knowledgable catholic, since you claim it to be a mediator as if intercession and mediation are the same thing, newsflash, they aren't. You don't ""pray"" to them since you are making a request for a prayer, and even then, prayer itself comes from the latin precaria, meaning a petition or request, that is not inherently worship or anything of the sort, it's a request, point blank. If your family offers to pray for you, do you get angry and give this same spiel about ""why the heck would you ever do that when Christ is the sole mediator?"" I'm very doubtful you do. Take away the fact the saints in heaven have shed their mortal form there is zero difference in asking someone here on earth to pray for you as asking someone above to pray for you.

"Your interpretation of John 20 is hermeneutically unsound. There are a plethora of other scriptures stating that God/Christ forgives **all** of our sins. Knowing that Scripture never contradicts Scripture since it is the word of God, it becomes evident that they are being granted and entrusted with the authority as apostles of Christ preaching the gospel to deem those who accept Christ as Savior as being forgiven by Him and those who do not accept Him as being unforgiven by Him. Christ is entrusting them with the power through the Spirit to correctly identify who has been forgiven/unforgiven through faith and to make the declaration of who has received forgiveness and who has not. Your interpretation contradicts other scriptures which are very clear and therefore cannot be correct, the latter interpretation is in line with other scripture. It is all one Word of God, if a contradiction is found, an interpretation is wrong.   You are trying to communicate with and talking to a being in heaven….even if you are requesting prayer, that is prayer for a prayer lol. Mediation, intercession, etc. Fun game of semantics….but again it is in your heart to seek help from others in Heaven but God Himself. Communicating to anyone in Heaven but God through Christ is found nowhere in scripture. Jesus says pray straight to God through him. Asking my church to pray for me is the same as asking humans in heaven to pray for me. TIL! Asking brothers and sister in your church is 100% biblical and we are surely instructed to do so. I can find no instance or directive in scripture of making contact with anyone but God in Heaven. Saying I can contact saints in Heaven to pray for me because I can ask my friends at church to pray for me is a total non sequitur that’s unsupported by the Word of God which gives us all the direction and teaching we need for spiritual matters. But yes, the Catholic church circumventing God’s instruction to do their own thing in the name of God. Definitely not what Jesus was saying to the Pharisees in the Gospels though, as you previously stated. So please continue to attempt to improve upon Christ’s church with your unbiblical traditions that are not supported by scripture whatsoever, unless you interpret scripture to fit your traditions rather than the other way around.  Evangelical lies lol. The Protestant evangelical movement starting with the Reformation is the only reason why the wack crap the Catholic church was doing got brought to light and how the Bible eventually got printed in other languages that weren’t dead which was illegal beforehand (btw just because the Catholic church assembled the different books of the Bible together in one place doesn’t mean they “made” it….God did through human authors, you guys essentially stapled it together in a dead language nobody could read so you could keep conveniently manipulating it in ways that validated new policies of the church for millenia after Christ ascended and the last apostles had died, thanks!). Once the reformation happened, the Catholic church had to back off all of their crazy manipulative shit from the previous thousand years. If it weren’t for the Reformation calling out how unbiblical they truly had become, they would have had no incentive to release some power and change some doctrine. You’re welcome. How about the unbiblical mandate of celibacy for clergy, that surely hasn’t backfired in any ways over the last century or so in particular…. While Paul makes the case in scripture that it can be good to remain celibate, he also later lists the qualifications for elders to be a one-woman man. So I believe scripture indicates pastors should be able to remain celibate, but it should not be mandatory. Again…..not in the Bible for that to be mandatory at all.   Also worth noting, there are actually quite a few (non-Protestant btw) studies establishing the correlation between the polytheistic roots of the Greek and Roman empires and the adoption of patron saints. Not a FB conspiracy lol.  In closing, I’ll leave with this. Which side says Christ is all we need because He is supreme and which says we need our traditions too? Who places Christ higher in relation to everything/everyone else in existence? Thats really all this boils down too and that foundational difference says it all about the worldview that every other doctrine and theology stems from",NeedsMoreHorsepower,2025-04-22T21:22:31,2
"Just continuing to show you have no clue what you're talking about. At all. Did I say that the men forgive your sins? Or did I say through christ they have the authority to hear your confession? Obviously God forgives all sins, what does that have to do with what I said? No, they are not just determining who is and isn't forgiven as if they are simply scanning individuals for forgiveness, Jesus is being so abundantly clear that ""YOU apostles are to forgive and retain sins on my authority, I am sending you to do this on my behalf"".   Oh wow, so you TRULY believe mediation and intercession are one and the same? That's actually so absurd. Nope, not a game of semantics, guess what, in your definition of them being one in the same now the very practice of praying for one another is now deemed sinful and eliminated, because it literally is intercession. Now, christ is sole mediator and apparently now the only person you can ever request to pray for you, wonderful. Really now? So you take severe issue with asking people in heaven to pray for you why exactly? Say you are right and that nowhere in the Bible it says they can pray for you, does that harm you? To request someone in heaven to pray for you akin to asking someone here on earth to pray for you is somehow evil and sinful? Oh and by the way, asking your friends and fellow churchgoers is no longer allowed anyways since you believe intercession is limited to christ only, so it's a moot point you cannot even argue for or against. You don't believe being alive in heaven is comparable to earth so yeah obviously you find it to be a terrible comparison, how unsurprising, even when we are united through christ and will not be separated as true believers.      Yes, evangelical lies, even the protestant reformers would look at modern evangelicalism in utter contempt and disgust for how far it has strayed. Yeah no, it wasn't illegal nor was it never done, use your thinking cap for a second. In the time before the reformation, why do you think bibles weren't common? Did the church actively prevent it? Or was it because literacy wasn't widespread and the printing press didn't exist to mass produce copies of the Bible to begin with? What makes more sense? Every single copy of a bible prior to the printing press had to be painstakingly handwritten and took an eternity to write, and when it came to translating the books, it was never prohibited, what was prohibited was when bad translations occurred that led to heresy, and of course here we are now, hundreds of denominations all because of figures like Luther believing he had authority to translate the Bible how he saw fit and determine what was and wasn't canonical. The douaey-rheims bible was literally translated into English before even the KJV, did the church take issue to this? No, because the church only wanted to insure that unauthorized translations did not materialize. Who said anything about the church ""making the Bible""? Did I say that? Or did I say that the church compiled the Bible and determined the western rite canon? All you do is argue in bad faith and continue to show that you have no idea what you're even talking about. I'm welcome? Welcome for what? Hundreds of years of division in Christendom that has led to the rise of so many heresies globally? Wow very bold to be proud of that. Yeah totally not weird to seemingly equate celibacy to a rise in pedophilia, as if that's a normal correlation.   Really now? There are? And according to who? Strange how you seem to indicate that it occurred around the 4th and 5th century even when early christian documents from things like the shepherd of hermas from 80 AD, miscellanies from 208 AD, Prayer 11 from 233 AD, Letters 56;5 253 AD, and so on. But I know I know, ""extra-biblical so it's wrong"", so they were all pagan polytheist heretics I'm sure right?   In closing I'll live this, christ left a church, not the Bible, and it took said church to determine which books were canonical or not. You're deluded and satan has deceived you",just_one_random_guy,2025-04-22T22:05:12,2
"Christ left a church built on His Word (Him) lol. It wasn’t assembled into a single Bible but the Word was there. The educated could read scrolls the uneducated could pass it along verbally. The true church is built on the Word of God, not on the whims of a bunch of power hungry vipers who have sought to interject their own will and traditions while circumventing the Word at every possible juncture so that their doctrines of man can be inserted. The church is subject to the enduring Word of God (whether it is in scroll form, verbal, or in a book), not the other way around. The heretical books were always invalid and heretical in God’s eyes, not because someone generations later declared it so. I am deluded by satan says the one who blindly adheres to and defends human traditions that aren’t supported within the Word of God. Christ most certainly did leave his human inspired Word, the Old Testament books were known across the Levant and the New was being written under inspiration of the Holy Spirit after his ascension, and being used to direct all of the churches being established throughout the Mediterranean by the apostles. The arrogance and heresy it takes to imply that all of that scripture of God’s Word wasn’t valid or foundational to the church until declared so by some fat pontiff centuries later is actually hilarious. Your first allegiance is obviously to your church’s tradition and historical human centered repeated abuse of power and not to the Word of God who came in the flesh. I would gladly leave any church which subverts, manipulates, or deviates from a well intentioned submission to GOD’S word, would you?",NeedsMoreHorsepower,2025-04-22T22:32:02,2
"Christ left a church with Peter as the rock, and yet here we are where you contest that notion. I have nothing more to say to you. You’re deluded and deceived by Satan. There is one church only, and it was founded by Christ as he said with the gates of hell never prevailing against it. You have provided nothing of substance and have only relied upon how YOU FEEL rather than actually provide any compelling arguments. I will follow what the scriptures you hold so dear say and not cast pearls before swine",just_one_random_guy,2025-04-22T22:35:35,2
"Thank you for bringing up Peter, he is my boy! Love it whenever he talks about that word which according to you was absentia/irrelevant, with only a church in it’s place to do whatever it wanted to in the meantime!  1 Peter 1:23-25 NIV For you have been born again, not of perishable seed, but of imperishable, through the living and enduring word of God. [24] For, “All people are like grass, and all their glory is like the flowers of the field; the grass withers and the flowers fall, [25] but the word of the Lord endures forever.” And this is the word that was preached to you.",NeedsMoreHorsepower,2025-04-22T22:52:21,2
