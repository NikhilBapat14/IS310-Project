"I don’t feel like opening up another “quick war” because Israel smells blood in the water. If they want to make moves, they’re free to but I think it’s an awful idea that I don’t want to be a party to",YoNoSoyUnFederale,2025-04-23T20:52:20,65

"Iran will never negotiate in good faith, if there's to be a strike now would be the time while their air defenses have been destroyed. The Israelis would be just fine with us arming them to do it themselves. We should take them up on it.",social_dinosaur,2025-04-23T19:35:58,17

"Israel lacks the capability to deal with Iran.  Their air force isn't large enough nor do they have enough deep penetrating bombs without resorting to nuclear weapons.  This is the best time to do something.  Iran is hurting and their air defenses are almost gone.  If we were going to do something, now would be the best time.  if not, we need to accept that religious extremists who use terrorists globally to enact their foreign policy will get nuclear weapons, and that Iran will forever be able to do whatever it wants - another North Korea, except with a functioning economy.  I wouldn't support another invasion.  However an invasion isn't needed to take out nuclear research and production sites.  Considering that Iran has been attacking American forces in Iraq for more than two decades, including last year, they've been attacking our naval vessels and civilian shipping vessels, and have been carrying out atrocities against our ally, I think it is reasonable to do something before they become effectively immune to us.",cathbadh,2025-04-24T08:09:00,5

"It's pretty effective.  One of my pet peeves of politicians is that they'll speak their mind,  catch hell for it, and then back down and apologize, change positions, or deflect that it was out of context.  Say what you mean, and mean what you say!",vialentvia,2025-04-23T21:24:11,17

"I guess they need B2 and MOABs in order to destroy under mountain facilities like in Natanz. Even if we gave these to Israelis, it takes time for them to get to speed how to use them.",Ask4MD,2025-04-23T20:06:53,3
> if there's to be a strike now would be the time while their air defenses have been destroyed  Huh?  Do you mean the strikes on the Houthi defenses in Yemen?  We haven't attacked mainland Iran... believe me lol.,bozoconnors,2025-04-24T08:05:25,1

"Iran learned their lesson from the Iraqi nuclear reactor.  They've split their nuclear sites up around the country, and buried them deep.  Israel has planes that can hit one or maybe two of them.  But the number of planes they would need to get through what's left of the air defenses, deal with Iranian interceptors, refuel everything involved, and hit all of the sites while then getting home is beyond their capabilities.  They also lack the number of conventional deep penetrating bombs they would need.",cathbadh,2025-04-24T08:14:02,2
"Yes, it would unfortunately take B2s to deliver a MOAB or a GBU 57, and I'm not sure we'd allow anyone else near that aircraft. And you're right, it would take a significant amount of time to familiarize the Israelis with the system. Could be done though.",social_dinosaur,2025-04-23T20:22:51,7

Wish the F35 could carry a GBU 57 because Israel already has them and wouldn't need to train up like they would on the B2.,social_dinosaur,2025-04-24T08:09:24,0
