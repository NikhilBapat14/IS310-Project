"IMO, it all depends on the conservative media universe.  Republican voters have been feed misinformation for years about Trump and the MAGA movement.  If the media continues to cover for Trump by providing excuses (Ex. Biden left a mess, going to take a while to clean up) and providing positive spin on every policy (Ex. tariffs are good, will bring jobs, just have to deal with pain for a little while) then Republican voters will continue to support him as they won’t know any better.",Tasty_Narwhal6667,2025-04-03T10:53:05,124
"It depends on what Trump’s approval rating looks like. If he stays in the high 40s, they will stick with him.  Chuck Schumer said when Trump’s approval dropped near 40% in his last term, Republicans approached him wanting to cooperate.  But things are different now. We have Elon Musk threatening to fund primary challengers who anyone who isn’t gimping themselves out to Trump. Maybe they saw how Musk’s efforts in Wisconsin didn’t help the Republican judge running for election, and might think a primary challenger being funded by Musk might not doom them.",Y0___0Y,2025-04-03T10:54:13,50
"Grassley (R) and Cantwell (D) introduced a bill today to reign in the executive’s tariffs powers. Bill would require congress to approve tariffs within 60 days or they expire. If Grassley is on board for something that’s probably a sign other republicans have had enough, of the tariff nonsense at least. Would need a veto-proof majority in both the House and Senate, though.",Hot_Juggernaut4460,2025-04-03T10:58:11,15
"There's little reason to have any belief that Republicans in congress will suddenly start putting up any kind of fight against Trump.  There's simply not enough congresspeople and senators from before 2016 that would be willing to do so.  Remember, even if congress passes a bill to shut down Trump's tariffs or some other aspect of his executive actions so far, he's going to veto that bill when it comes to his desk.  They would need to accumulate 2/3rd's majority in both houses to accomplish that, which certainly seems like an absolute lost cause.  Weirdly, the Senate might be the most primed to push back on Trump with more long-term GOP politicians in that chamber, but only 5ish senators on the GOP side have shown anything resembling a backbone, and even then you have to deal with the Fetterman defection that will inevitably occur.  The house on the other hand will accomplish nothing.  Mike Johnson is so indebted to Trump for his job that he'll do whatever Trump wants to shut down dissention.  Not until January 2027 will you see any real pushback, unfortunately.  The best bet for any real action in my opinion is congress finally has enough of Trump taking their appropriation powers and they file suit against the Executive and take his ass to SCOTUS.  Then you could really see some white knuckling if SCOTUS rules against Trump and Trump ignores the SCOTUS ruling.  It would literally be our entire government teetering on a cliff's edge, and I don't have the belief that SCOTUS would hold the Executive in contempt (Or however something like that would play out), nor do I believe that congress would then file and hold impeachment hearings over Trump's abdication of the constitution.",wrestlingchampo,2025-04-03T11:06:00,14

"Republican officials are generally aligned with or are afraid of Trump.  The latter will turn on him if that is needed to win reelection in 2026.  In most cases, they won't need to change.  Most seats on either side of the aisle are safe and aren't likely to shift.  The days when voters would turn against their party en masse as they did 1932, 1964 and 1972 are behind us, thanks to the culture wars.  It's the purple seats held by Republicans that are most likely to see some movement, but few of the rest.  Susan Collins is the rare senator who is able to consistently win across party lines.  So she plays moderate on certain issues.  It seems likely that the senator who follows her will be a Democrat.  Rand Paul is ideologically libertarian on these kinds of issues.  So this is a matter of following his beliefs.  McConnell is an establishment Republican, not a populist.  The GOP establishment supports free trade.  In addition, Kentucky is probably going to be disproportionately harmed by this.  Almost all of the world's bourbon is produced there.  GM and Toyota manufacture cars there, and there are parts suppliers there who are part of the supply chain.  This may be one of those rare instances when McConnell and Paul both actually care about the state of their state.",I405CA,2025-04-03T11:57:16,2

"Interesting question.  Thanks to gerrymandering, most Congressional seats are not that competitive, so the biggest threat is a primary challenge.  As you point out, there are probably more red districts in play than the GOP might think, and this will only get worse if tariffs spike inflation and/or trigger a recession (they absolutely will if most are not negotiated away).  The question is not whether Republicans will turn (carefully) against Trump, but how many and when.  At first, it will likely be those in swing districts, but as Trump's term nears an end, I suspect a lot of Republicans will stand up to Trump on unpopular issues.  The GOP has a problem. Trump will be a lame duck after 2026 (I hope), and Trumpism without Trump has proven quite unpopular, the fallout from tariffs and DOGE will make this even worse.  Trump's policies and behavior are fairly unpopular, but he has a few things going for him.  * He was on the apprentice for 14 seasons cos-playing as a successful businessman. This gave voters a baseline familiarity with Trump that led them to give him the benefit of the doubt in 2016. * Trump is authentic. Yes, he is ten pounds of shit in a five pound bag, but the shameless lying and bluster is part of his brand. Voters hate politicians and see Trump as a useful hammer to destroy the existing system they see as failing. * Trump got lucky in 2024. Voters hate high inflation, and that made Biden and Harris even less popular than Trump, even though inflation wasn't caused by Biden. * There are around 5% of Trump voters who came out of the woodwork in 2016 and never vote unless Trump is on the ballot. This is why polls are accurate for mid-terms and inaccurate when Trump is running.  Can you think of any prominent Republican who has massive name recognition, outsider status, reasonably high popularity, and MAGA credentials? It will be very hard to find someone who can keep the MAGA base together while also being able to appeal to swing voters.  JD Vance, Matt Gaetz or Kristi Noem could deliver the MAGA base, but nobody else. Marco Rubio or DeSantis can draw in the remaining ""establishment"" Republicans and some swing voters, but MAGA will stay home. Tucker Carlson is an outsider, but he has no crossover appeal.  No wonder the GOP wants Trump to run again.",judge_mercer,2025-04-03T11:48:28,1

"Writing as a former Republican (left around '06-'07), the current group that calls themselves the GOP is a party of weak lemmings, appealing in general to those who somehow think life thinks enough of them to conspire against them, hence looking high and low for someone to blame.

"I would be extremely surprised if Trump hasn’t broken up with Elon and tossed him under the bus by the time midterms roll around.

For another, can you imagine the ego thrill Trump would get from *firing the richest man who ever lived?*  I think Trump is simultaneously setting Musk up to be the fall guy when shit goes south, and also bringing him close and building him up, so that it’s an even bigger statement of Trump’s power when he knocks him down.  Just Mob-boss things, basically :)  “Elon went a little bit too far, he went too far, didn’t he?  And we had to let him go, we let him go.  And it’s a shame, because you had, and of course it’s the *Biden* economy, and Biden *ruined* it, and of course you had Elon.  You had Elon.  And he went too far, and I said!  I told him.  I did.

">Not until January 2027 will you see any real pushback, unfortunately.  Even then, Trump is just ignoring budget requisitions for things he doesn't like, and there isn't going to be a large enough Dem margin in the House and Senate to overcome his veto even with marginal Republicans - who are the ones most likely to be replaced if Dems win anyway. He'll certainly be impeached if the Dems take the House, he's breaking laws all the time, but he won't be convicted because Republican Senators will never vote for it. Oversight will be largely useless, witnesses will just decline to show up or ""not recall"" (under Bush, Rove and Gonzales proved that that was fine) and we learnt from the Signal-gate that they aren't keeping any records, not to mention they can always just burn documents like Dick Cheney did.  >Then you could really see some white knuckling if SCOTUS rules against Trump and Trump ignores the SCOTUS ruling.  I think the risk of this happening is why it won't happen. Think of it from the perspective of Judge Roberts - does he want to issue a ruling against Trump that Trump will blatantly ignore? No, he does not. Whenever Roberts avoids the strict party line it is to secure institutional legitimacy, and that would destroy it. He's far more likely to craft some narrow ruling that excuses Trump's actions. Only on things that Trump isn't really concerned with  or that Trump won't just ignore but instead will cloak under a fig leaf so that he keeps doing what he wants but can say he is doing it a legal way, will Roberts vote against Trump.",just_helping,2025-04-04T04:44:40,2

"People often push back on comparisons between MAGA politics and Putin’s Russia, but when you actually look at the substance — not the slogans — the parallels are hard to ignore.  Nationalism and isolationism? Both movements are built around the idea that their country has been “humiliated” or “weakened” by global cooperation. MAGA’s “America First” mirrors Russia’s rejection of the West and its glorification of sovereign power over international alliances. Both frame compromise as weakness.  Traditional values as political tools? In both contexts, there’s a heavy emphasis on returning to “how things used to be.” That translates into anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric, attacks on gender expression, and a broader rejection of progressive social norms. Russia does this through state policy and propaganda. MAGA does it through legislation and media outrage cycles. Different methods, same goals.  Distrust of democratic norms? Putin’s strategy has always been to hollow out democratic institutions while maintaining the illusion of public support. MAGA’s flirtation with election denial, weakening trust in media, and glorification of “strongman” politics isn’t a coincidence. It’s a feature, not a bug.  Populist resentment as fuel? Both ideologies weaponize frustration — real or imagined — to create enemies: elites, academics, immigrants, or foreign powers. It’s not about solving problems, it’s about channeling anger to maintain control.  And let’s not forget: thinkers like Alexander Dugin — a major ideological force in Russia — have outright praised MAGA’s rise. He sees it as proof that the West is finally rejecting liberalism in favor of nationalism and traditionalism. That’s not exactly a glowing endorsement for a healthy democracy.

They tell me what they're doing, you are telling me they *aren't* using a calculation they very clearly are using.",zaoldyeck,2025-04-08T15:09:35,2
Someone *doesn't charge us a tariff.*  Tariffs are taxes *on your own country.*  Jesus fuck.  I swear people don't even understand the most basic facts.,jaylotw,2025-04-11T13:43:37,1
"The objective is fair trade. Preferably no tariffs on anyone. If they don’t want that then they get reciprocal tariffs. Idk where you’re getting your information from but I would say a 3k jump in the stock market while the rest of the world is tanking is a pretty good indication that tariffs work. Why do you think all these countries are coming to the table? And before you think this is a “maga” thing, I would look into how Nancy was calling for the same thing during the Obama administration",Jen0BIous,2025-04-11T13:20:26,0
"Well you don’t understand the basic premise of what a tariff is.  A tariff is a duty imposed by a national government, customs territory, or supranational union on imports of goods. Besides being a source of revenue, import duties can also be a form of regulation of foreign trade and policy that burden foreign products to encourage or safeguard domestic industry.  So you’re categorically wrong.",Jen0BIous,2025-04-11T13:55:03,0
">The objective is fair trade. Preferably no tariffs on anyone. If they don’t want that then they get reciprocal tariffs.  Again, for that to be possible, you must calculate ""reciprocal tariffs"" based on the effective tariff rate charged by another country.  That's the only way you get ""reciprocal"".  But that isn't the calculation.  They gave you their equation, what part of it is difficult for you to understand?  Is it the Greek letters?  Do those scare you away from reading a 3rd grade math expression?  >Idk where you’re getting your information from  The [white house website](https://ustr.gov/issue-areas/reciprocal-tariff-calculations).  >but I would say a 3k jump in the stock market while the rest of the world is tanking is a pretty good indication that tariffs work.  The ""jump"" happened when Trump **paused** his insane tariffs. By *not* imposing his very one-sided tariffs.   For 90 days.  And even then we've mostly seen the ""gains"" from Thursday evaporated and even now US treasuries have barely recovered which is truly terrifying.  Trump is creating the kind of economic policy that *everyone* assumed was impossible, and congress is too impotent to challenge their glorious leader.   That's dictatorship shit.   >Why do you think all these countries are coming to the table?  You mean why do I think the Trump administration is saying that ""all these countries are coming to the table""?  Because what else are they going to say, ""we're morons crashing the global economy because we elected a madman with a cult following surrounded by sycophants""?   They'd be championing a ""success"" right through a self created financial crisis.  They'd blow up their house and tell you how good it is that they installed a new skylight.  >I would look into how Nancy was calling for the same thing during the Obama administration  A simultaneous trade war with the rest of the world by imposing tariffs more extreme than smoot hawley based on a nonsense calculation from a trade deficit?  Uhh, gonna need a citation on that because I sure as heck can't find any.",zaoldyeck,2025-04-11T15:01:04,2
Let me ask you a question.  China says they're putting 50% tariffs on US goods.  Who do you think pays the tariff?,jaylotw,2025-04-11T13:59:47,1
"Yea you know why he paused it? Because these other countries realized we were serious. And because they don’t want to have to pay import fees they are coming to the table to negotiate fair trade. Whether that be equal but less expensive tariffs on both sides, or none at all,that works out for everyone. It’s not a complicated thing to understand. That’s what free trade is. Clearly you have a hard time grasping this concept, so I would advise you to just sit back and enjoy the economic boom you seem not to want.",Jen0BIous,2025-04-11T15:18:18,1
"We do. The difference is we haven’t been able to sell basically anything in China. So their tariffs against us aren’t that disruptive.   On the other side of things, I imagine most things you (and the rest of us honestly) were made in China.  So just to spell it out. While we export about 5% (don’t quote me and I think I’m being generous) of our products to China, they export around 40% of their products to us.   Now I should hope I don’t have to spell this out, but who do you think is going to be hurt more by tariffs, the US or China?  Oh and before you worry about us still having to pay for their imports, we can create or acquire most things we need as a country without China. And while they could produce things themselves, they have a huge aging population (thank you one child rule). They have no way off attacking us in any real sense.   Their economy is already teetering due to these tariffs, selling off bonds to keep afloat, but those will run out eventually.  Idk just seems like a lot of uninformed fear mongering",Jen0BIous,2025-04-11T14:25:46,1
"> Yea you know why he paused it? Because these other countries realized we were serious.   I know that's certainly what he would *say*, ""I paused it because I created a self-imposed financial crisis and people finally convinced me that's a *bad* thing"" isn't Trump's style.  He's too narcissistic to admit fault.  >And because **they don’t** want to have to pay import fees they are coming to the table to negotiate fair trade.   They don't.  That's not how tariffs work.  People *importing* pay the tariff, the exporter doesn't.  >Whether that be equal but less expensive tariffs on both sides, or none at all,that works out for everyone.   Do you understand the meaning of the word ""equal""?  Do you know how to create an *equal* tariff?  What steps would one need to do for ""equality"", because again, it's not the Trump administration's calculation.  >It’s not a complicated thing to understand. That’s what free trade is. Clearly you have a hard time grasping this concept, so I would advise you to just sit back and enjoy the economic boom you seem not to want.  Figuring out how you have an equation in front of you, given to you by the administration, and you decide to ignore it is very complicated.  How is it that they can give you an equation to calculate the import tariff charged and you *still* don't seem to understand it?  It's not a ""reciprocal"" tariff.  It's a tariff based on the *trade deficit*.  Nothing more.",zaoldyeck,2025-04-11T15:30:03,2
