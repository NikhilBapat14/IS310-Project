"The process is called ""Suspension of the Rules"".  https://www.congressionalinstitute.org/112th-congress-house-floor-procedures-manual/viii-suspension-of-the-rules/  Bills normally require a lengthy process to get votes on, including lengthy floor debate, the ability to propose and vote on amendments, and a good while to actually cast a vote.  The majority leader may call for a bill to be passed under a suspension of the rules. This is normally done for bills that are expected to have broad support. This process bypasses the normal debate and amendment process for bills, and brings them quickly to a vote. Due to bypassing the normal rules, it requires 2/3 of the votes to pass.  It isn't an unusual act. In 2022, 301 of the 350 bills and resolutions that passed the House did so under a suspension of the rules.  https://www.progressivecaucuscenter.org/suspensions-117th-congress  It's normally a way to bring things to a vote you don't see value in wasting time on debating and going through the normal processes.",ProLifePanda,2024-12-23T12:12:27,1
"""It's normally a way to bring things to a vote you don't see value in wasting time on debating and going through the normal processes.""  But every year I always hear lots of complaints about the spending bills, not just this year. Heck, Kevin McCarthy basically lost his speakership over one of the last ones, didn't he? So it doesn't seem to be something that you'd expect the rules to be suspended over.",JustASumoGuy,2024-12-23T18:02:35,1
"Yes, Republicans (and Democrats somewhat) play chicken with the debt ceiling and the annual budget. But the reality is nobody WANTS a prolonged shutdown. It costs a lot of money and starts affecting people. So they will cause a big fuss, but when they finally have a solution, they want to implement it quickly. They don't want to come to an agreement, and have it delayed weeks going through the standard bill process, especially if you know you have the votes to get it through on an expedited basis.",ProLifePanda,2024-12-23T18:26:27,2
Is the spending bill something they can start the process on earlier so that it would be able to pass with simple majority? Or perhaps they know it won't get through the senate if it's just by simple majority since that implies it'd be a pretty partisan House Bill; maybe that's why they play chicken with it as you say?,JustASumoGuy,2024-12-23T18:32:01,1
">Is the spending bill something they can start the process on earlier so that it would be able to pass with simple majority?  You would hope, but because we keep putting out continuing resolutions, it means the negotiations aren't working, and we keep kicking the can down the road for a few months. When we finally get an official budget, it will likely go through the normal process.  >Or perhaps they know it won't get through the senate if it's just by simple majority since that implies it'd be a pretty partisan House Bill; maybe that's why they play chicken with it as you say?  They play chicken because they can say they aren't giving in to special interests and are fighting against spending, all while knowing they can just pass a quick CR and not deal with negative consequences.   You're also right that partisan budgets need to overcome the filibuster in the Senate, meaning there needs to be at least a little bipartisan agreement to get it through the Senate.",ProLifePanda,2024-12-23T18:36:49,2
