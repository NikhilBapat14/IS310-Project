"lol what a scam. Imagine if the Dems did this, the GOP would have a three year meltdown over it.",Riversmooth,2025-04-22T18:17:42,36
"So now we've gone from the ""not mentioning it"" to the now common MAGA ""yes I did that -  so what"".   Problem is it was not disclosed in the refund filing as required by Florida law. And much of it was Federal money. The kicker is like a day later, that exact amount of $10 million when to his AG's own two superpacs to fight (and win) against the bill to legalize recreational pot. This is a Mafia story folks.",williamgman,2025-04-22T18:22:14,20
"Reading....   Holy frack. How the bloody hell is this not grounds of impeachment, indictment, arrest, and a criminal trial? How much of that $10,000,000 will go into DeSantis' secret bank accounts?",Still_Mix3277,2025-04-22T18:41:00,10

Only Trump does it better. Y’all forget about Regeneron Ron and that time Ron trafficked those migrants using his buddie’s private planes to wash that sweet sweet taxpayer money through government contracts. Gotta divert allllll those tax monies GOP-DOGE style.     Trickle down piss on me!,Resident_War5075,2025-04-22T22:45:00,2

">Maher had once been an outspoken critic of Trump, and Trump of Maher. In the past, the Commander-in-Chief called the comedian a “low-life” with a show that is “dead.” Even still, the White House visit was enough to change Maher’s mind.  This smells like blackmail.",Still_Mix3277,2025-04-22T18:42:50,1

It gets worse - they then moved the money from the charity to a Political Action Committee run by DeSantis’ then chief of staff. The same chief of staff who is now conveniently the Attorney General of Florida.,solobeauty20,2025-04-23T06:48:28,2
