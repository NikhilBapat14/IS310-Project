"The United States has what, 300 million people? The rest of the world has 7.7 billion. So does it make more sense to have a customer-base of 300 million that don't have to pay tariffs and 7.7 billion that do, or to have 7.7 billion that don't, and 300 million that do? Well all else being equal, you definitely want the latter. You don't want the vast majority of your customers to be discouraged from buying your products owing to idiotic tariffs.  Moreover, you go where the talent is, and the United States is about to see a brain drain of untold proportions. Intelligent people aren't generally keen on living and working in a country that actively demonizes knowledge and critical thinking, and has a decent chance of sending you to a prison in El Salvador without charge or trial if you upset the wrong people.  If this persists, the United States won't be ""self reliant"". It'll be dilapidated wasteland.",Mjolnir2000,2025-04-03T03:24:11,63
The world is restructuring to move the US out of their trade plans.  Eventually the US will be like north Korea or Russia that have been forced to have minimal trade with other countries over bad policies.  Basically us citizens will not be able to afford  foreign goods soon so they will stop being imported.  Then those goods will just be sold on other markets.    My guess is that this is trump crashing the economy for his friends so they can buy stocksnand companies cheap and then he will reverse the tariffs in a few weeks to get immediate gains in the market.,clintCamp,2025-04-03T05:10:06,15
"My biggest question is if trump does force manufacturers to build plants in the US (outside of the ones already here) do US workers work for developing nation wages and conditions or is the american-made version simply more expensive. If it's more expensive then the tariffs have to stay in place forever to prevent me, a cheapaskate, from buying the same washing machine (or whatever) from Indonesia or wherever, right? So either prices on everything are going up forever to artificially bolster American manufacturing OR (and I'm sure it's more likely this) American workers take enormous cuts in pay, benefits, and conditions to compete with their global counterparts - which given the cost of living in the US compared to other industrialized nations isn't a great option for them.    Seems like quite a gamble. This  shit may have worked 100 years ago when the majority of population on the planet was still 100 years behind the US but that time is WAY gone. China, India, Indonesia, etc etc. are modern industrial nations.",McGrawHell,2025-04-03T20:59:47,3

"Rs have been trying to implement a consumer sales tax in substitute of income tax for federal revenue, this tax scheme affects bottom 70% of population vs 70% of income earners as a need to stretch the dollar further where as wealthy people would see tax burden sink and a few extra dollars won’t bother them.

"Yes, the explicit goal of these tariffs is to make it so that US citizens cannot afford to make buy goods produced in foreign countries while simultaneously reducing US wages so much that it is easier to afford our own products.  Or in others, to drive high paying jobs out. Combine with brain drain, and this will simply make Americans as a whole poorer.",ManBearScientist,2025-04-04T09:25:09,1
I guess what you're seeing here in the comments is that there is no benefit. So that's a question that should be asked is:  Why would they do that? There are several possible answers to that particular question. One of the possible answers is that it's a deliberate attempt to wreck the American economy. Another possible answer is that Trump has just lost his marbles.,Watching20,2025-04-04T17:48:13,1
"What you describe as a brain drain is a long term effect. You'd need civil war type of event in the US to have people move out of the country en masse for this to show up as a short term effect.  But the truth people have a hard time appreciating the long term effects of such policies. You have to look at things that happened, 10, 20 or even 30 years ago to understand what long term effects look like. Think of the long term damage the war in Iraq did for US foreign policy - anything from basically eliminating the UN as avenue of exercising soft power multilaterally to the long term destabilizing effect the conflict had on the region to the reputational damage the US suffered as a result. Or banking regulation like the Glass-Steagal Act that created unregulated shadow banking leading more or less directly to the 2008 financial crisis.",Shoddy-Cherry-490,2025-04-04T19:38:44,1

"Tariffs are a regressive tax that affect those at the bottom most, and scale down the more money you make or have already.

"Tariffs and outright bans on exports from the USA have worked for other countries.  I’ve been to Japan and Vietnam. Vietnam especially has prospered since the 1980s. If it’s OK for them to have tariffs on American goods, why not vice versa?  When I was in Vietnam, I ran into many Australian tourists. They too are prospering. Why have they banned the importation of American beef?   Seems to me that the criticism of Trump’s tariffs are coming from people who’re angry that he’s in power and the Democrats aren’t.

"As far as I am able to see this whole thing, other countries don’t have blanket tariffs like the one that Trump put up. They are for very specific products, such as diary products for Canada.  Yes, they have tariffs that go up to 300% but they have something called ‘Rate Quota’ tariffs and not Ad Valorem tariffs like the ones that are being imposed by USA. In this case, Canada would charge those rates to their citizens if the purchase of say dairy goods go over 2.5M Kgs. Apart from cheese which kinda dances around that margin, no other product even comes close - intact usually hovers around 0.4M kgs.   And the other reason why Canada had such impositions, is so that they can promote their own products, and didn’t want US’s milk primarily because of growth hormones and chemicals as well as added logistical costs and generally lower quality.   But blanket tariffs? No country has done that.",Here2Last,2025-04-03T07:31:00,11

">""Seems to me that the criticism of Trump’s tariffs are coming from people who’re angry that he’s in power and the Democrats aren’t.""  Every single economist of note in the country says these tariffs and the way they are being implemented is bad for the economy, regardless of their personal politics. That's not an emotional assertion, no matter how much you might like to dismiss disagreement as ""angry"".   >""They didn’t criticize President Biden when he kept Trump’s tariffs on China instead of repealing them the way he repealed Trump’s border policies.""  Biden didn't repeal Trump's tariffs because those tariffs were specific, not broadly applied to all Chinese imports and because rapidly changing economic policy creates instability, such as we are seeing today, with Trump's on again/ off again waffling on tariffs.   This is bad economic policy and the only people I see defending it are Trump supporters.",BluesSuedeClues,2025-04-03T08:45:02,5
"Tariffs are not default good. They are default bad.  A bad economic policy can still have use cases where it fits perfectly. If tariffs were a medical procedure, they’d be an amputation. Sometimes necessary to save the life of an industry, never performed for the fun of it.  Vietnam doesn’t have tariffs on US goods. They just don’t. The vast majority of US products imported into Vietnam don’t have any duties applied to them at all. The tariff rate across all products for Vietnam is 1.07%, compared to the US’s pre-Trump rate of 1.49%.  In 1995 that was 15% versus 4%.  We just applied a near 50% percent tariff on all Vietnamese goods.  That’s nukes to matchsticks.   Now, let’s talk WHY tariffs can SOMETIMES be good.  If country A is struggling to employ its citizens and/or needs its citizens employed by a specific industry, they have an economic incentive to tariff country B that has an economic advantage in exporting goods for said industry.    This lets country A increase employment numbers and potentially build up the capital investments needed to compete in said industry long-term.  BUT.   That comes at a cost. Country A’s citizens can’t afford the products made by that industry as easily as before, and County B retaliates.  The net impact is negative: a small percentage of the country is now in long-term employment, but all citizens are relatively poorer because their currency doesn’t go as far.   Employment numbers may even drop if the retaliation is particularly fierce or if the country was at relatively high employment numbers and didn’t add many more jobs by protecting an industry.  Trump’s tariffs aren’t an example of a prudent tariff. He isn’t protecting an American industry, and he isn’t employing them at a time where our employment numbers need to be pumped up.  They are an example of the exact opposite: employing a broad tariff at a time where virtually everyone that wants a job, has one.  We are at near 40 year lows in every tracked unemployment statistic (and yes, that counts ‘underemployment’ and people having to take up two jobs).    Because his tariffs are massive (by far the largest ever enacted) and indiscriminate, they possess none of the protectionary benefits that a more targeted tariff would have. And because he chose to employ them when unemployment was the least of our worries, it won’t help employ people. Instead, companies will likely have to lay off workers due to the tax increase Trump just levied on them, alongside the loss of investment and purchases of their products abroad.  If tariffs are an amputation, Trump just took our country’s body and performed an amputation on its arms, legs, and head because he had a personal theory that tariffs always made people healthier.",ManBearScientist,2025-04-04T09:49:05,2
"I don’t know about Vietnam, but Australia did it so that they could promote their own beef to the world. Which, worked successfully and they also wanted to avoid meat that’s ridden with Mad Cow disease.   But the problem I see here is the fact that USA is putting tariffs on everyone for everything. That would inevitably become extremely expensive for everyone, everywhere. Maybe countries outside of the US would be able to pick up slack after a point, but the USA would suffocate a LOT.   I’m trying to look at this clinically and not from either democratic or republican POV. Since those opinions will sully the decision making process.
