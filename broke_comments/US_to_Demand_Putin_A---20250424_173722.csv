look at how this frames this as some sort of win   jfc,RoachedCoach,2025-04-24T17:42:05,1
"What Putin accepts or doesn't accept in that regard is not relevant. Ukraine *has* a military. They're using it to kill the Russian invaders. If Putin doesn't like that, he's free to pull his forces out of Ukrainian territory.",e_t_,2025-04-24T18:38:40,1
Putin won’t allow Donny to talk like that very long.,Doublebosco,2025-04-24T17:46:52,1
"The sooner that the U.S. grabs its ball and goes home from the talks the better it will be for Ukraine and any chance, however slim, that might exist for a peace treaty. Trump’s clown show is just sucking up air under the pretence of “talks.” There are no talks, not even in Trump’s feeble mind. Trump today declared that Russia’s concession in “talks” has been to not take all of Ukraine. Not only is that insulting, it’s a promise that was already made by Russia in the 1994 Budapest memorandum.  There is little doubt that the U.S. will withdraw its support for Ukraine at some point with only the degree of withdrawal to be determined. The question is to what degree will Europe be able to make up the shortfall and will Trump actually move the U.S. to ally Russia? That is not completely out of the question at this point.",blue_quark,2025-04-24T18:10:24,1
Does it really matter what Putin does or does not accept??,RiseDelicious3556,2025-04-24T17:54:50,1
I really like how Trump ended the war overnight.,TheRustFactory,2025-04-24T17:59:42,1
Trump doesn't know Russians nearly as well as he thinks he does! Growing up a Russian family helped take care of me when my grandmother died - I suspect that's where I get my terrible stubborn streak from!,justtakeapill,2025-04-24T18:05:09,1
Trump REALLY flexing his muscles on Daddy Putin. If he's not careful Putin is gonna have to put him in the gimp costume for 2 whole days...,OnlyRise9816,2025-04-24T18:31:34,1

"Not even claiming that, just that they have the appearance of self defence.  Trumps so far signed away crimea, 25% of Ukraines territory and it's major shipping ports, large portion of its oil and signing away it's rights to ever join the EU or Nato.  Then Trump also wants half a trillion of natural resources mining rights which will take like 50-100 years assuming they ever leave and for Ukraine to likely buy US products they can't afford to put in their piles of rubble.",LegitimatelisedSoil,2025-04-24T18:53:25,1
