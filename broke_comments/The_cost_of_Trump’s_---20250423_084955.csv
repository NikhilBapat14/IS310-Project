"Leadership in wealth comes from leadership in information and technology, which comes from where? If you guessed something other than math and science, then you might be one of the people who got us into this mess.   Like the internet? Science. Like weather forecasts? Science. Like roads and cars? Science. Like the phone on which you're probably reading this? Science. Like healthcare, like Tylenol, antibiotics, surgery, heck, even toothpaste and shampoo? Science. Like buildings? Science. Like not having to push a plow across a field all day? Science. Like things that are manufactured, like probably everything you see lying around you at home or wherever you are? Science. Basically, if you like anything in the modern world, then either you support science or you're oblivious or a hypocrite or both.",SirsatShake,2025-04-23T09:24:29,4

"A very well thought out article. This nails it:  >Few observers think the private sector or philanthropic bodies want, or have the ability, to fill the deep gap left by cuts to state-funded research. Levin, the biotech chief executive, compares NIH grants to the country‚Äôs highway system. Although they were built by the federal government, industries could not function without them, he says. ‚ÄúWithout the highways you wouldn‚Äôt have got very far in this country.‚Äù",ratwing,2025-04-23T09:08:20,2

That will change under the circumstances.  This is an opportunity not to be missed by a leader with a long term vision. And brains.  And balls.  Which rules out 3/4 candidates.,Torrid_Beaver_Paste,2025-04-23T19:47:35,1
