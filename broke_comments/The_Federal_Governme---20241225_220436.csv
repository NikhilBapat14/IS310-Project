"The problem that is often cited is the fear of wealthy citizens simply leading the state. The [Fourteenth Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/amendment-14/section-1/) protects the right to move from one state to another. There is some amount of research into this topic, some suggesting that overall trends lead to outflow of wealthy citizens with increased income taxes. [Shocker: Wealthy Americans tend to flee high-income tax states](https://www.investmentnews.com/tax/shocker-wealthy-americans-tend-to-flee-high-income-tax-states/251879) (citing [The Introduction of the Income Tax, Fiscal Capacity, and Migration: Evidence from US States](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20210388)). Other studies have concluded that this is actually a minority factor in citizen movement, focusing on employment opportunities as a more powerful driver. [State Taxes Have a Minimal Impact on People’s Interstate Moves](https://www.cbpp.org/research/state-budget-and-tax/state-taxes-have-a-minimal-impact-on-peoples-interstate-moves).   A wealth tax is new territory though, because we're talking about taxing people based on assets as opposed to income, Elizabeth Warren's proposal for example proposes an increased tax only on households with more than 50 million in assets, approximately the wealthiest 75,000 households. [Ultra-Millionaire Tax](https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/ultra-millionaire-tax). You didn't ask about the efficacy of these taxes and/or implementation, so I'm not going to touch on the nuance of the plans; that plan is a good example though, tax the absolute wealth-hoarders and leave everyone else untouched.   If the Federal Government implemented such a plan, it's likely that the math would work out (depending on the proposal) that for *some* percentage of the ultra-wealthy population, it would make more sense to simply leave the country and not pay. Some are dual citizens and could renounce, others could renounce their citizenship and seek residency in one of the nations that allows investment residency/citizenship. Would anyone actually do that? we don't know, it depends on the individuals and the specific plan. It's tough to extricate yourself from a country, and it's tough to extricate yourself from the U.S. economy. These are the people who have the easiest time (financially) abandoning the country, but simultaneously some of the largest headaches (financially) when doing so.   If a State Government implemented such a plan, the math of moving would probably be more appetizing for a LOT more people. There is no application process for moving a domicile. There is no need to shield assets, if you live somewhere else, the tax just doesn't apply. There is no need to stop doing business in the U.S.,  liquidate assets, or stop vacationing in your home state.  It would be appetizing to simply buy a home in another state, pretend to live there, and fraudulently establish the domicile. Obviously, I'm not condoning that behavior, and it wouldn't be legal, but it's practical. It's a lot easier to claim you live in Mississippi than to claim you live in Spain.   You'll notice the last two paragraphs don't have citations, and that's because this is highly theoretical. We know the effect increased taxes have on movement between states. It's at least *a* factor, even if you don't agree it's *the* factor; in either case, the correlation is there. A wealth tax on the ultra-wealthiest by a state may or may not make citizens flee, but the calculation to do so would be far in their favor when compared to a federal tax. That's a legitimate political fear.",SYOH326,2024-12-26T15:58:12,9
"Because wealth taxes cause the wealthy to leave, which means less revenue. [France abolished their wealth tax for this very reason.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity_tax_on_wealth#:~:text=The%20solidarity%20tax%20on%20wealth,%E2%82%AC1%2C300%2C000%20(since%202011).)",Dustypigjut,2024-12-26T15:35:23,9
"The federal government doesn't refuse to impose wealth taxes so much as those taxes are unconstitutional.   [https://minnlawyer.com/2021/03/03/wealth-tax-problem-its-probably-unconstitutional/](https://minnlawyer.com/2021/03/03/wealth-tax-problem-its-probably-unconstitutional/)  See also this argument, which suggests that it's constitutional but you'd basically have to set the rate higher in poorer states to meet the apportionment requirement. That in turn raises Fourteenth Amendment equal protection concerns.  [https://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3245&context=facpub](https://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3245&context=facpub)  States are purportedly considering wealth taxes.  [https://www.cbsnews.com/news/wealth-tax-in-8-states-california-new-york-connecticut-washington-illinois/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/wealth-tax-in-8-states-california-new-york-connecticut-washington-illinois/)  It seems unlikely (to me) that this will happen because internal mobility in the U.S. can't be restricted. The article suggests that people are making the argument that the wealthy continue to live in high-tax states despite high income taxes, but that's pretty dubious Jeff Bezos legally lives in Florrida now, Elon Musk in Texas. Bill Gates and Larry Ellison have property in Florida and in order to be Florida residents for tax purposes they'd just have to spend more time there, which I'm guessing is not a huge hardship. It might not be worth moving for a few percent of annual income (after rich people deductions) but probably almost universally would be for a percent or two of your net worth per year.",whip_lash_2,2024-12-26T20:41:57,1
">It would be appetizing to simply buy a home in another state, pretend to live there, and fraudulently establish the domicile  You wouldn't even need to do that.  Establishing residence in another state is, frankly, easy.  Get a new place, change mailing address, get a new DL, open new bank accounts in that new state.  That can be done in a matter of a week.  The old residence can either be sold or rented out.  And if you're moving due to a wealth tax, you probably aren't doing much except house shopping and letting your accountant/lawyer do the rest.  What's a few dozen thousand dollars of billable hours if it saves you multiple of that per year?  And given modern technology, it wouldn't be too big of an issue telecommuting.  You could even travel back as needed, just having your accountant/assistant track your days to make sure you don't trip something up.",AuditorTux,2024-12-26T21:49:16,2
"The wiki page you link does not suggest a reason as to why the ISF was abandoned, only that its critics complained that it drove the wealthy away - no evidence is provided to suggest this was an actual outcome. Other comments here provided citation directly contradicting this claim. I'd go even further to highlight that the French program really wasn't that aggressive with a marginal rate of 1.8% for highest earners. I doubt that was sufficient to drive away those that benefit so dramatically from living in France, this is below even historic rates in the US.",tytytytytytyty7,2024-12-26T18:12:45,6
