"Let's think for a minute, if they have a SS number and they work, then they are paying into Social security. So the real point is that the  GOP want the SS to collapse so they can privatize it.",pouwiz,2025-04-22T10:47:49,23
"From Violet Miller/Sun-Times:  Local leaders and advocates held a news conference in the Loop on Monday morning to speak out about recent staffing cuts and changes to Social Security that they say will hit the most vulnerable the hardest.  In Federal Plaza, Rep. Jesus “Chuy” Garcia criticized the administration of President Donald Trump for terminating thousands of workers from the Social Security Administration, which could potentially lead to cutting half of the agency’s entire staff.  That comes after the closure of 47 Social Security offices throughout the country, including 26 this month.   “They say it’s about efficiency, but we know the truth,” Garcia said. “This isn’t about Americans, it’s about the rich getting richer. … This is not just bad policy, this is a civil rights crisis.”  The federal government also recently classified more than 6,000 living immigrants as dead and canceled their Social Security numbers, meaning they cannot legally get a job, collect Social Security benefits or receive certain government benefits. This also makes it harder to open bank accounts or enroll their children in schools.  Many of the immigrants affected by that move had been allowed to remain in the U.S. for two years with work authorization under presidential parole authority by the Biden administration, but many had their status revoked by Customs and Border Patrol this month.

Proud to have him as my congress person. He is an immigrant himself. He’s also one of few congress people that don’t take AIPAC money.,Jellyandjiggles,2025-04-22T11:27:16,2
MAGA proving once again that cruelty is the point.  Right wing politics is mostly about gratifying sadistic impulses to make others suffer under the thin pretext of dehumanizing lies. ,Beantown-Jack,2025-04-22T10:39:34,3
