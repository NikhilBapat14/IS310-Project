"The problem with that is ""we go high"" implies the Democratic party punches back. What's actually happened for decades is the Republican party kicks the Democratic party in the balls over and over and over and OVER again and the sole response the Democratic party gives is to go ""would you please stop that?"" if they bother to react at all.   The Democratic party keeps treating the Republican party like old friends they should try to work with instead of a bunch of psychotic power hungry nutjobs who must be stopped.",immortalfrieza2,2025-04-24T23:00:58,1
