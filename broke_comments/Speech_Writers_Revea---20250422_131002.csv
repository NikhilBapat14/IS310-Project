"I've watched a number of their speeches during this tour and the main thing is consistency. They are, time and time again, hitting the main points that are affecting normal people: healthcare, economy, jobs, education, and rule of law.   They're not allowing themselves to be pulled off message by all of the distractions that are present. The messaging through each rally speech is strikingly consistent. Its also the kind of stuff people desperately need right now. We need a nation ruled by laws, that provides for the people, so that people can work stable jobs with proper wages, not worry about getting sick or hurt and becoming bankrupt, and be able to send their kids to schools that are safe, sane places.  Its working because people have known for years and years what we need, its only that the ruling class has been intentionally deaf to it, because it hurts their bottom line.",Orzorn,2025-04-22T13:23:56,22
"**From reporter Brittany Wong:**  On the eve of summer tour season, the hottest ticket in town isn’t Lady Gaga or Beyoncé: it’s the “Fighting Oligarchy” tour.  For the past month, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) have criss-crossed across western states, making the case that the system is broken, and President Donald Trump and his allies are only involved in government to enrich themselves.  Democrats ― directionless after their general election loss and reeling from everything Trump has accomplished in his first 100 days in office ― have come out in droves to hear what the progressive pair have to say: In Los Angeles, the crowd was 36,000 strong. In Denver, 34,000.  Crowds in red states and conservative bubbles have been surprisingly receptive to their message, too: In Salt Lake City, 20,000 squeezed into the area at the University of Utah. In Idaho,12,000-plus came out. Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders drew a three-mile long line at their rally in Folsom, California ― a place where the population reliably votes red.  “I heard ... that someone started flying a plane with a banner that said, ‘This is Trump country.’ It sure don’t look like it today,” Ocasio-Cortez said to the crowd of 30,000 people.  What’s hitting home for voters? Having honed their message for years, both AOC and Bernie come across as authentic, according to Ted Widmer, a speechwriter and senior adviser to President Bill Clinton.

"For the people who are uninterested in reading the article, the point is that they sound like actual people who have real ideologies and ideals that they're trying to make a reality. The biggest issue with the Dems for years is that every word and policy feels like it was run through two hundred focus groups that all contained the same type of over-educated white post-grad students. This makes them seem like overly intellectual jerks trying to pretend to speak to normal people. That's really bad in a country where most people vote based on if they feel like you could sit with the person and have a beer.  AOC actually directly called this out after the election. The Democrats have to stop being so frightened of simply speaking from the heart because they're afraid if they use the wrong adjective, they'll offend someone.",DisMFer,2025-04-22T16:02:44,5

Bernie has been consistent about this the past 40 years while conditions have been getting steadily worse. He of all people has credibility on this.,Orange8920,2025-04-22T13:38:10,18

"identity politics. If the left focused more on the list this commenter provided, and less on immigration, trans issues, race issues, people could come together to vote against the oligarchy. There should be no billionaires. They are the real evil, not the trans or immigrant boogeymen. But these issues divide people, the right knows it, so they do abhorrent things to make the left go nuts, and now all we’re talking about is immigration or trans rights, etc. not the fact that the richest are only getting richer at the expense of everyone else.",Noooo0000oooo0001,2025-04-22T19:45:19,-1
