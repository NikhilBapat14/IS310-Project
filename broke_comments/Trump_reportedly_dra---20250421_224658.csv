"It’s actually astounding how stupid Trump is, like just when you think it can’t get any worse with him he shows his ass everytime.",ImjustANewSneaker,2025-04-21T22:59:55,51
"Trump didn't draft anything. His cronies draft it and just tell him to sign it. Trump is not aware what he is signing, ever.",Tomrepo92,2025-04-21T23:21:09,31
What does shutting down embassies accomplish?,36monsters,2025-04-22T00:02:26,10
"The Proud RAPIST, Donald Trump, adding some environmental terrorism to go with his domestic terrorism, leading to more international terrorism.  When he’s not making criminal deals while golfing, or in the act of human trafficking, he enjoys partaking in a multitude of terroristic activities against those who dare share the same planet.",DrFarfetsch,2025-04-21T23:55:10,5
No he didn't. Dude couldn't draft a ham sandwich recipe.,KrakenClubOfficial,2025-04-22T01:27:15,4

The governments have to directly communicate with the white house maybe? Versus delivering messages to ambassadors?  Trumps wet dream is a line of foreign leaders at his door paying  homage I think.,amensista,2025-04-22T00:35:53,14
2 things here are true: he is stupid and compromised   The stupidity is what made compromising him so easy,chatminteresse,2025-04-22T10:08:43,3
Cool a great solution is to add 7 trillion dollars to our deficit in order to give the incredibly wealthy yet another round of tax breaks....definitely realistic,SquirrelODeath,2025-04-22T00:54:23,26
"Republicans have added more to the deficit than Democrats for decades, the spending bill that was just passed is more of that.",ImjustANewSneaker,2025-04-22T00:45:25,21
Then he should reverse the Trump tax cuts on the rich and increase their taxes instead. And reverse the cuts to the IRS.  That would reduce the deficit. Not whatever this is.,RoboChrist,2025-04-22T04:59:03,7
Watch what happens to the debt when the dollar loses reserve currency status because of Trump and continue to blame the democrats.,schu4KSU,2025-04-22T05:53:22,4
"That's not how it works. Embassies aren't there for the benefit of the host country, they're for representing that embassy's country's interests. Keeping track of local political and policy currents, cultivating political and business leaders, protecting their citizens, explaining their policy to the local government, even gathering intelligence. If a message needs to be delivered to another country, your embassy in that country delivers it and passes back the response.  Removing US embassies is yet another way to weaken US influence abroad.",CharacterUse,2025-04-22T02:20:34,8
Its fine we will counteract those tax cuts with social security and obamacare. The peasants will be fine.,throwawaypostal2021,2025-04-22T13:18:34,1
"Is it me, or is the current administration's slant really isolationist?",Fillerbear,2025-04-22T03:07:20,6
Oh. Ok. Well this administration doesn't give the slightest shit about any of that so I guess the embassies are out then.,amensista,2025-04-22T05:49:52,2
