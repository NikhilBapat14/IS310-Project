"I was talking to my orthopedic surgeon who has his own practice. He said the reason why he has to raise prices and ask a lot from insurance companies is because of this type of thing. He told me that I would be surprised how many people don't pay their medical bills. Well, he owns his own practice and he's responsible for everything. The only way he can fix that is raising the prices. Then liberals complain about healthcare prices being so high!!",BossJackson222,2025-04-23T22:18:27,1
