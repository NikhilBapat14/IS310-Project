"Missing one detail in the logic. This country is no longer a sovereign nation of USA. This administration has made us into an unofficial member of the Neo-USSR. We are becoming more like Belarus or nazi germany than a Democracy. We are sitting around debating while the WH discusses building multiple concentration camps outside this country, and sending US citizens., and ignoring even the SCOTUS.",Thensaurum,2025-04-16T02:07:17,3
