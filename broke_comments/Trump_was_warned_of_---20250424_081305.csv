"So he's saying there's communication and a deal is on the way.  China is saying nothing is going on.  Know who I believe on this? China.  China just has to wait. It'll be painful for them but not as painful as it will be for the US.  Finished goods, raw materials and goods are not coming into the US at this tariff rate. The US supply chain will be completely disrupted and US goods won't be able to be produced.  It's a heck of a lot worse than the $5 toys going missing from Wal Mart shelves.",CockBrother,2025-04-24T08:20:11,33

"It's always interesting to realize someone's kryptonite.  Trump will not budge from his path of cultural issues, international relations, immigration, etc.  But he's uniquely concerned about the economy and will respond to pressures on this topic.  I'm not quite sure how but his seems the path for those who oppose this authoritarian takeover to expose his weaknesses.  Along with the fact that he will never admit to a mistake, or a change in course, publicly, this presents an opportunity for resistance.",CrimsonFeetofKali,2025-04-24T08:19:24,3

"\> So he's saying there's communication and a deal is on the way.  I haven't seen anywhere that Trump or Bessent are saying the communication is *with China*, just that discussions/communication are ""happening"".  The call is coming from inside the White House.  That ties in with Trump's repeated statement that if China doesn't negotiate terms, he'll set the terms as well as the tariffs will come down, but not to 0 and some casually floating a number like 25% or 45% on goods of a non-national security standing and 100% of ones identified as having a national security component (implemented over a period of five years to allow for the creation of domestic manufacturing).    His handlers have to see this 'reset' as their least worst option: taking away all of the reciprocal tariffs *for now*, which could open negotiations with China by taking them back to the original 15% plus the global 10% with some magical hand-waving, add the *concept of  plan* mechanic giving markets the appearance of stability for a week or two, which they imagine gets the market back in to 'line goes up' mode and lets Trump get back to demonizing marginalized people and destroying democracy in an effort to get his polling numbers back up with billionaires.",Weak-Regular7772,2025-04-24T08:40:14,0
"Oh no. He did this on purpose, to drive the market down so his rich buddies could buy on the cheap, and then he retracts all of this tariff nonsense, the market goes back up. He looks like a hero, and his billionaire buddies are all the richer for it.",Constant_Affect7774,2025-04-24T08:59:46,5

"> I'm not quite sure how but this seems the path for those who oppose this authoritarian takeover to expose his weaknesses. Along with the fact that he will never admit to a mistake, or a change in course, publicly, this presents an opportunity for resistance.  How is when the GOP oligarchs go public with their outrage at Donald's incompetence. Surely they've been venting privately for weeks, but the damn may finally break with more CEO's expressing outrage. Recession predictions and a 10% drop in stock indexes will go a long way to reining Donald in.",jpmondx,2025-04-24T08:37:43,2

"Huh?  >“We’re going to have a fair deal with China,” Trump said at an impromptu gaggle with reporters outside the White House. Asked if the U.S. was “actively” negotiating with China, Trump said: “Actively. Everything is active. Everybody wants to be a part of what we’re doing.”  What's the definition of negotiation?  >discussion aimed at reaching an agreement.  There are no talks. No discussion.

"Poetic license. We make a public statement, China makes a public statement. Trump says we are communicating.   Just like the press secretary said we have 18 trade deals on paper.
