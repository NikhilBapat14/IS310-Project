I hope they investigate the issues with the vaccine now. There are people like me out there that have had their life ruined by it.,kaytin911,2025-04-18T10:54:57,22

You can tell the left is here by a completely sensible request for vaccine side effects being investigated getting down voted.,Merax75,2025-04-18T17:27:12,32

I get death threats in my DMs for talking about being injured from the vaccine. They are unhinged and authority figures are their gods.,kaytin911,2025-04-18T17:36:46,18
The biggest problem with the left is they get so focused on the narrative that they suppress questions...which leads to more suspicion.,CantSeeShit,2025-04-19T10:14:02,3

"Yeah thatâ€™s a shame. Iâ€™m as pro-vaccine as they come and Iâ€™ll admit I had my doubts at first, but Iâ€™ve heard you talk about this before and I believe you truly had a severe immunological reaction. These things are rare but that doesnâ€™t mean they donâ€™t deserve proper investigation, in fact itâ€™s critically important that we do so. As Laplace wrote in *Essai philosophique sur les probabilitÃ©s* (translated):  > We are so far from knowing all the agents of nature and their diverse modes of action that it would not be philosophical to deny phenomena solely because they are inexplicable in the actual state of our knowledge. But we ought to examine them with an attention all the more scrupulous as it appears more difficult to admit them.  These people who are supposedly pro-science should probably educate themselves on the philosophy of science as well.  Sorry youâ€™re getting treated this way. Iâ€™ll come to your defense any day of the week.",zip117,2025-04-18T20:32:28,8
