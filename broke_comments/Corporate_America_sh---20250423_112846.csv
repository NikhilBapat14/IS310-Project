"Toyota gave him a million bucks. Think he cares that his tariffs will hurt them? Nah, they‚Äôre just suckers and losers like all the other fools who ever gave him a dime.",OPMom21,2025-04-23T11:47:09,5
"Do what you can to not spend a dime on large corporations and entities. Support local to the best of your ability. Move your money away from not only from politically aligned corporations, but all of them.   I know this is not always possible, but all of us can make personal choices that will ultimately hurt these scumbags in their wallets.   I do not eat at chain restaurants ever, I do a lot of my grocery shopping at local ethnic stores, I cut off nearly all of my subscriptions, stopped all Amazon purchases, shop for clothes locally or second hand, any entertainment items I purchase are from mom and pop shops. My money goes back into my community.",BarfHurricane,2025-04-23T11:47:58,3

Why are inaugurations being funded by corporations anyway? Just swear the person in and get on with it with a modest  budget from the government. Why are we so accepting of all this corruption?,LaeliaCatt,2025-04-23T17:07:20,1
