">”Our Constitution entrusts Congress and the States — not the President — with the authority to regulate federal elections. Consistent with that allocation of power, Congress is currently debating legislation that would effect many of the changes the President purports to order,” she wrote. “And no statutory delegation of authority to the Executive Branch permits the President to short-circuit Congress’s deliberative process by executive order.”  It’s so mind numbingly dumb that this judge has to take time out of her day to hold “Constitution 101” lessons for a sitting POTUS.",Spicy_Pancake1,2025-04-24T13:19:43,34

"If it means I get to vote these horrible leaders out, I would give a body just to vote.  They have mad people so angry , it is gonna be hard to stop people from exercising their right",Tiny-Professional827,2025-04-24T16:56:09,1
Another Democrat Activist Judge trying to block common sense.   The only reason not to require ID or allow ballots after election day; is to cheat.,pragmaticpatriot,2025-04-24T17:56:00,1
This is what is baffling to me about a lot of this.  Granted I don't like the things Trump is using EOs for but if these things were passed by Congress like they are supposed to be they might be a little more well received relatively speaking.  To be clear I am speaking in a general sense.,Xayton,2025-04-24T13:24:29,3
"I feel like if the judge has to do this to a president, that president should be immediately evicted from the Oval Office and barred from any future elected positions.  Like, if someone is so incompetent or malicious of a president that they have to be told by a judge that what they’re doing is against the Constitution, what the fuck kind of country are we running?  One where the highest office in the land gets to just trample over the Constitutional rights of more than 300 million people whenever it feels like it just to wave it aside like nothing happened?",SuperLuigiUnited,2025-04-24T13:36:17,4
"This isn't just about ID, but it's having both a Citizenship and ID document just to register to vote   Such a requirement serves literally no benefit as you already have to be a citizen to register, and only makes it harder to access a ballot.    This shouldn't be a partisan argument.  It's literally just a pointlessly cruel requirement.",TehWildMan_,2025-04-24T18:50:43,1
For the most part the reason they are done through EOs is because they would never pass Congress. ,eskimospy212,2025-04-24T15:40:00,1
