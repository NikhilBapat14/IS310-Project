This is why every President (except Trump) put top-notch experts in these high level positions.  Asskissing should not be the only qualification that the Commander In Chief looks for in candidates.,InAllThingsBalance,2025-04-22T07:51:52,99
Pete’s big brain moment: It’s not classified once it’s shared with everyone.,TheRedheadedMonster,2025-04-22T07:47:46,237
">“No classified material was ever shared via Signal,” said Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell, who called the allegations “an attempt to sabotage President Trump and Secretary Hegseth.”  Honestly, it's just... concerning. We're talking about someone in a position of immense responsibility, and they're casually sharing sensitive information on unsecured channels... with their family. It makes you really question their judgment. Like, how can we possibly trust someone to handle national security when they can't even seem to grasp the basics of safeguarding that kind of data, especially when you think about the question posed, “How can we trust someone in a position of national security when they're casually sharing operational details with their family and friends?” It's not just about the allegations themselves, it's the sheer carelessness that's being revealed here... and it's disturbing to see.",Tremenda-Carucha,2025-04-22T07:58:20,46
"As a contractor who has worked on sensitive systems before...I don't think the general public is aware that any of what he is doing is grounds for dismissal and revocation of a security clearance.  If you're on a program with heightened sensitivity beyond being released to the general public, you never share details with people who haven't been read on so to speak (or literally). I'm talking not your friend, your brother, your mother, your wife, your dog even.  Hegseth is a clown with an ego who wants to flaunt the data he has access to. He has no business in his position and that's becoming clear to everyone.",ibeerianhamhock,2025-04-22T09:06:42,27

"Loose lips is declaring he can declassify anything he wants, with impunity and justice. Because his children are privileged and protected. The republican leadership tells the parents of the enlisted men and women they know what their kids signed up for and should except it. And let their children be sacrificed by the republican leadership. The republican leadership will use the century of 1700, against the civilians and use 1700 military law with our children in the military. The republican governors get to decide which law and what century in accordance with their mission statement project 2025. This is happening right now. The republican mission statement project 2025 is presented to the world, this mission statement make colonies out of the republican governor led states. The republican leadership believes democracy has failed and colonialism is the method of restoring legal human trafficking and slavery through the penitentiaries. The republican leadership is destroying retirement plans and standards of living. The republican voters believe colonialism with legal human trafficking from the state controlled penitentiary will give them social entitlement retirement and safety. When the state executive branch receives monies from penitentiaries for an incarceration labor force, or pays the penitentiaries to house the states labor force the logic stands that all the civilians are labor force through the penitentiary.
