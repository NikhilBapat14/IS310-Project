"Some recent good polls but the trend tells a story of typical honeymoon fade. +6 approval at start now minus 3.4.   https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/approval/donald-trump/approval-rating  At the end of the day, for the midterms, this will come down to if people feel better off then or not.   Most of what he’s doing is good politics and good policy, but the tariff stuff can overwhelm all of that by inducing a recession. All the political wins you can imagine won’t overpower a 6% unemployment rate or inflation. He must be careful here. Voters may like Washington being disrupted but don’t want their financial situation also disrupted. This topic is especially perilous because it has real results that are felt pretty quickly and affect everyone.",Unlucky-Prize,2025-04-15T14:03:14,99
The narrative does not match his approval. Imagine how high his approval numbers would be without the steady negative drum beat of the mainstream media.,StillTruthSeeking,2025-04-15T13:30:33,-10

">At the end of the day, for the midterms, this will come down to if people feel better off then or not.   Agree, but it's still a long ways away.  There is a lot of good things  that can happen (and bad) but I'm betting on Donald's instincts on this, and gambling that more good things than bad will happen by midterm time.",GiediOne,2025-04-15T16:07:43,-25

"True but the effect of this stuff plays out over a few years. The investment shadow this is making from all the ‘wait and see’ investors will create recessionary pressure from now out for a few years. We are creating a hole in that pipeline right now. Every day this continues make a recession more possible, so I hope he works it out quickly.",Unlucky-Prize,2025-04-15T16:16:28,25
>True but the effect of this stuff plays out over a few years.  Trade investments have already been moving to India and if you get a free trade agreement with India and (for example) Vietnam and other South Asian economies (other than China) all things tariff will go - in a sense - to zero.  Goods and manufacturing does not need to go to America right away for prices to lower.  They will be made and imported to America from non-tariffed countries.  In the meantime medium and large global manufacturers already have idle plants in the US that don't need permits to be built.  They are already there but idle.,GiediOne,2025-04-15T16:22:19,-8
"Investment - in general- is on pause. That has downstream suppression of job creation. It is even more on pause for domestic manufacturing which can be underwritten differently depending upon the particulars of trade policy. Practically you can’t plan a domestic process for a low margin high volume manufacturing business if you don’t know what you can source outside the U.S. and what inside, because small changes there blow your margin vs pricing power. That’s creating a real shadow that increases every day even if projects that were going to happen anyway. Because Trump has put everything on the table and there are diverse views in his admin, assurances that something is not on the table aren’t persuasive to institutional investors. So they wait.",Unlucky-Prize,2025-04-15T16:28:55,17
">Because Trump has put everything on the table and there are diverse views in his admin, assurances that something is not on the table aren’t persuasive to institutional investors.  Who cares about wall street, mainstreet has more than enough money to invest in uncertain times.  If you are a business owner and haven't planned on rainy days, you don't deserve to be a business owner.  Companies like NVidia and Apple have *billions* in cash on hand to do what they need to do to protect/grow their respective companies.",GiediOne,2025-04-15T16:50:03,-12
"Sorry, just not how it works. I do believe in the power of small business and it’s a theme in my family: but these big manufacturing projects use institutional capital, and most business scaling to 8 and 9 figures revenue uses institutional capital. Good new ideas often are more small business. But institutional capital is frozen right now and it will eventually cause a recession if unaddressed.  Apple and nvidia are the definition of institutions. They invest deliberately and are very careful. Trump has given them some focus so perhaps they have a bit more clarity…",Unlucky-Prize,2025-04-15T16:59:05,19
">Sorry, just not how it works.  Sorry if you don't understand that the American economy is so large that tariff or no tariff  - foreign direct investment will come to America - whether they like it or not.",GiediOne,2025-04-15T17:19:11,-7
"Well, we got massive amounts of foreign investment currently with previously few tariffs. But you can’t plan a major investment if you don’t know what the investment case is. Not possible with this approach to tariffs. It changes every day.",Unlucky-Prize,2025-04-15T17:24:12,19
"Nobody is making any significant investment with so much in flux right now.  The tariff situation needs to be figured out, the constant will he - won't he is putting businesses in a bad spot. We can't forecast anything right now.",ShillinTheVillain,2025-04-15T19:57:16,14

">Nobody is making any significant investment with so much in flux right now.  Really?👀  >I**magine a single policy shift triggering a $3–$4 trillion investment wave into the United States**—more than the GDP of most nations. On March 24, 2025, President Donald Trump stood alongside Hyundai executives at the White House, announcing a $20 billion investment in American manufacturing and declaring, “We’re well into the $3–$4 trillion mark, which has never happened to our country before.”  >https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/global-investment-boom-34-trillion-pouring-us-economy-marcus-magarian-y6fce",GiediOne,2025-04-16T00:11:27,0
