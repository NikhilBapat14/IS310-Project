"I don't think I've ever witnessed a president, hell, not even a fed chair, turn out to be so singlehandedly responsible for destabilizing markets.  It's also no surprise that Trump is trying desperately to blame these outcomes on anyone or any*thing* else but himself and his own actions and policies.  And policies, mind you, that damn near every economist warned us about. It's not like these were wild predictions either. These consequences were clearly forecasted.   Current estimates show that a recession is around the corner, with real GDP growth for the first quarter coming in negative at -2.2 percent.  When Trump caved on his ""liberation day"" tariffs, he claimed that dozens of countries were coming to the negotiating table, when in fact, the current administration is struggling to make deals with these other countries, including Japan, one of our largest trading partners.  And let's be clear here, Trump didn't back down because these other world leaders were ""kissing his ass,"" he backed down because his policies are reckless and he was likely being pressured by his advisors to roll back some of his trade policies. And by pressure I mean he was probably being spoken to like a parent speaks to their child when they're trying to get their kid to eat vegetables.  No, these countries aren't kissing Trump's ass, they're being alienated and forced to take a harsher stance against the U.S.   And what's worse is that as Trump continues to escalate economic and diplomatic tensions between us and these other countries, they are being incentivized to turn to China! And believe it or not, China has their collective shit together and can weather the storm a hell of a lot better than we can.  And this is such an egregious failure because we were previously in a position where we had China economically isolated...  Now, keep in mind that Trump has still imposed sweeping tariffs on a wide range of goods, products and services from dozens of countries, while he continues to escalate his second trade war with China, because that worked out so well last time...  He obviously never learned his lesson from last time. Because not only did Trump start a trade war with China during his first term, which led to damaging consequences for American businesses and consumers, but he also managed to increase the trade deficit at the same time.  But his supporters will tell you that this time it's different somehow, even though one of his stated goals is to balance the trade deficit and force other countries to treat the United States ""fairly.""  Yes, the United States, which has spent the last several decades centering the current global trade system around itself, is now the victim of the system it helped build in the first place.  I came to realize that this narrative—which Trump uses to justify his disastrous trade policies—is merely an extension and representation of the right's persecution complex, but on a global scale.  But all of this hasn't kept Trump's spokespeople from going to bat for him, claiming that he's playing ""3D chess""  while lying to Americans about the long term effectiveness of his ""genius"" policies. ""It's all part of the plan."" What fucking plan? You've shown us that there is no immutable plan here, that there is no certainty or stability whatsoever, and that the current administration is entirely untrustworthy.  This is all while Trump continues to make allies of enemies and enemies of allies as he fails to follow through on his ""day one"" promises.  In fact, it appears that Trump is more interested now in readmitting Russia back into the international club, than he is committed to negotiating a peace between Ukraine and its land grabbing enemy, nay, *our* enemy.  And yes, the flagrant hypocrisy of Trump and his supporters has been on full display these past few months.  Where in the past they used the stock market, CPI data, consumer confidence, price increases, Fed announcements, etc, as major metrics for indicating that a democrat president was doing a terrible job, this time around, they're bending over backwards to defend Trump and rationalize why poor economic trends and ominous predictions are no big deal.  What's worse is that most of the economic issues we faced under Biden were a direct result of the global pandemic and its reverberating shock on the economy. On the other hand, most of the economic issues we gave today are the direct result of one man's actions. Which is historically damn near unprecedented.  And Trump is such a vindictive, insecure, pretentious idiot that he doesn't realize, nor does he care that his rhetoric and actions are having the opposite intended effect on the economy. He doesn't realize that threatening to fire Jerome Powell will force markets into a tailspin. He's even gone on national TV and admitted that he ""couldn't care less"" if businesses raise their prices!  All those people who claimed they voted for Trump because he's a ""businessman"" don't realize that Trump is indeed running the country like he does his businesses, straight into the ground...",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-04-22T00:37:43,16
