"  Don’t worry, Trump isnt a dictator. He just doesn’t like when his peasants don’t listen and refuse to blindly do whatever he wants. Harvard just needed a punishment for not obeying our dear leader.",Chubbygator847,2025-04-14T21:33:22,28
Let's start a crowd fund to start making up the deficit that Harvard will have over this and SCREW the CHEETOAD.,Puzzleheaded_Two6805,2025-04-15T03:41:04,2
Their endowment is $53 billion and they have hundreds of thousands of wealthy alumni. I’m sure they predicted that something like this would happen when they made that public statement telling the Trump admin to promptly fuck off.   They’ll be just fine. My concern is more for the smaller universities who want to take public stands similar to Harvard but won’t because they don’t have the same resources and can’t afford to lose their federal funding.,GameSpirit2015,2025-04-18T00:18:31,1
"No.  It's Harvard.  They already have  a long list of donors, most of whom are wealthy or a part of industry itself.",crucial_geek,2025-04-15T09:09:46,12
"I mean, not to be a negative Nancy, but there's no way you would crowd fund anywhere close to $2.2 billion.",OH_FUDGICLES,2025-04-15T07:46:55,1
