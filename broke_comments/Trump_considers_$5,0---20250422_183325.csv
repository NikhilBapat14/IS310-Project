Children are expensive. The reason birth rates are declining is because people can't afford them. People are struggling to afford themselves. $5000 isn't going to put a dent in that. It will end up creating more problems than it solves.,RandolphE6,2025-04-22T18:51:01,754

"Babies are luxury items and $5000 isnt going to fix it. I was fortunate enough to join the military young, get out with 0 college debt, use the VA Home loan in 2017 when starters were 200k to 259k and 3% rates. I also paid off the wife's college debt before trying for a kid.  If one of those factors were different it would be impossible to afford a kid. My same house that's $1400 a month mortgage, if i had to buy it in today's numbers it would be closer to $3800/month. Our 3 days a week of daycare is $1200 a month. If we had college debt or bought a house now we wouldn't be able to afford a kid.   The cost of living and inflation is what made kids become luxury items.

"In my opinion, the reason for declining birthrates is less of a problem of 5k per birth but the individual standard of living one wishes to maintain vs the invidual standard one would want to have for their child.   Food, clothes, furniture, suitable housing, daycare, schools, college, hobbies, university etc.   All of this costs truckloads of money and that's just the factors that parents have to somehoe have I their control, not to mention wars inflation etc that is outside of their control.   Just think about it. All over the world parents usually want a better life for their kids, than the one that they lived themselves. This is a good trend for for ""poorer"" countries as an even 1% better life would consume in total less resources, than a 1% better life in a rich country. So with each generational increase in living standards the next generation of potential parents have it harder to reproduce this increase.    Right now we are experiencing a society that has reached the threshold for most people. Providing a better life seems no longer possible or so hard that people don't bother.  ""Might as well just both work, drive a Mercedes and make expensive holiday trips all over the world.""  As a society we have to find a way again to have a civil discourse to ask ourselves, where do we go with this?  Is perpetual growth possible?  Is a ok for a child to live a ""lesser"" life than its parents without experiencing any sort of stigmatization of either parties?  How do we support the people still willing to give life deposite all the current challenges?  How do we handle the ones that need assistance?  How do we treat the ones that fail?    But all I hear from whatever party is name calling and ideas like ""let's throw out 5k dollar checks"". This shut ain't gonna cut it.

"The solution is obvious.  Cost of living has been on the incline since the beginning of the nation, but income has always lagged behind.  After WW2, there was a massive economic boom that petered out and died in the 1970‚Äôs.  Ever since then, despite the fact that workers are more productive than they ever have been, they are not being compensated for it.  We have a minimum wage system, but its only used by a minority of workers, yet workers above minimum are still undercompensated.  So tie minimum wage to productivity to set a floating wage that adjusts yearly, and have it adjusted further based on COLA which is already used for Social Security and eliminate inflation devaluation.    This rewards workers for performance and removes unscrupulous employers ability to underpay wages.  This would push bottom wages up to around 25/hr before local (state) adjustments.  There would be increases in prices, as people spend more money and thus raise demand, but it would not raise 1:1 to income.  By raising the floor you not only close the gap between productivity and wages, but also narrow the wealth gap.  We would need to adjust taxes by eliminating the payroll tax and adding a tiny tax, maybe a 1% federal VATS, to products, so it wouldn‚Äôt destroy employers with small margins and the slight tax on all goods to compensate for that loss of tax revenues.",DingbattheGreat,2025-04-22T19:50:12,42

Everyone says they want more housing, but when that new housing development starts getting planned in *their* neighborhood suddenly they kick and scream about it. The *""Yes! Do that... but not in my backyard""* crowd shows up to the town zoning meeting and they manage to knock down the proposal. This is effectively California's problem in a nutshell and why it's so absurdly expensive to live there, but honestly some red states have the same problem.  Same sort of thing with nuclear power. People want it, it would reduce the cost of energy, but not in my backyard!  If we could ever get out of our own way... there is a lot we could do.

It means if you can't afford to live in Miami you should move to Mississippi and raise your family there. That's what the market is telling you and it's telling you that for a reason - we don't need more families in Miami, which is already overcrowded and resources are scarce. Go where resources are plentiful and live a better life. The opportunity is still there for you, and that's what's important right? Sounds like you want to paper over and ignore the market even more... You know those problems and costs just don't magically go away right? Everyone can't live in Miami and have big families the resources available just do not support that no matter how much you try to lie about it with communist plans and programs. That always ends the same way.  > The labor issue is a bit of a non sequitur here  How can you say something so ridiculous? When the supply of labor is high wages go down which discourages ""producing"" more people (this is basic supply and demand). It is beyond absurd to say that this is a non sequitur. Not only is it logically causal (and obviously so), but it's quite likely the primary cause!  > If you need people to start having more kids now, even completely cutting off immigration tomorrow isn't going to do much of anything in the near term  Completely false and a strawman because I never said to ""completely cut off tomorrow"".

The results just wouldn't be good for the left because it would prove them wrong and significantly reduce their power.

Nothing against you, it's just getting hella old here. I get it, brigading, but you don't need to asterisk every good idea or smart suggestion that actually gets upvotes.   >that he's going to give it to welfare queens, because that's what ""conservatives"" on reddit do these days I guess.  It's not going to *only* go there, but a cash-in-hand credit will apply to responsible parents and baby mills alike, and that's poor implementation.  Which is why subsidizing *support structures* is, imo, a much more sensible plan to reversing the demographic trend. Money put towards resources that encourage time spent with family, easing the burden of parenthood, and clearing hurdles to new parents is a lot easier to manage responsibly than a blanket stipend.",Dungeon_Pastor,2025-04-22T21:45:13,3
"Super cheap insurance (as long as it doesn't have a maximum coverage amount) is how insurance is actually supposed to work. It's there to protect you if you have an absurdly expensive medical crisis that you couldn't predict, but you're responsible for smaller, routine costs. Then you save in an HSA to ensure your OOP max is covered tax-free, and you won't run into issues unless you start using non-covered services and out of network providers.",TheEternal792,2025-04-22T22:20:47,15

"That I don't know actually.  Could be that he didn't have the money to spend on Cobra with no income.  Food > healthcare debt  Our church ended up stepping in and paying for it.

"I think the real solution to health care in this country is to decrease health insurance as much as possible and return to a system where doctors are actually paid directly by patients.  The fact that they can currently charge services that their patients don't actually (and often cannot) pay is kind of absurd. Hell, most doctors don't even KNOW what their services cost. That's handled by the (often incompetent... I'm speaking from experience) financial administrators.  If the pay was direct, prices would be forced to come down to a point where people could actually pay for them. Because doctors would not be able to operate if their patients couldn't afford their services. They'd go out of business.  Contrast (for comparison) with other health-related businesses where insurance is less ubiquitous: Chiropractic, Dentistry, Optometrists, Veterinarians. Most of those provide direct pricing scales (that are easily accessed) before service is rendered, and most can be afforded out of pocket. I'm not saying any of them are CHEAP, mind... but they're orders of magnitude cheaper than medical doctors. And I think it's mostly because they still deal directly (business-wise) with their customers.",Swiftbow1,2025-04-23T00:54:49,4
"Yes, I'm the one moving the goal posts. Certainly not you in your second reply to me. Anyway, 5k won't do anything to help.

That is ironic and stupid. You expect me to post an entire thesis and defense of it over the exhaustive list of economic shifts that leads to increased wages while you make meme replies that show you dont even understand basic economics.,DingbattheGreat,2025-04-23T05:11:43,10
"No, not force. But try to sustain an economy where more families are not required to have two incomes to get by. (For example, stop overspending and driving inflation up.)

"Absolutely agree. That‚Äôs the true way to bring costs down for people. However, you‚Äôll never be able to sell that to the left, or the neocon wing of the right, which is a larger percentage than we think in my opinion.  To me, insurance should be used for terrible, unforeseen problems that come out of nowhere. Think how car insurance is used right? You don‚Äôt ask insurance to cover your oil, tires, break pads, etc when they need changing. But when you get into an accident or something just craps out, that‚Äôs what insurance is for.  The system you describe would also allow for actual personal accountability around health care in the country, yet our progressive left wants to move in the other direction, of course.

"No lie, I separated those statements on reading, and thought you were complaining about assuming the worst of your comment. That one's on me.   That said, a cash incentive for per child isn't a terribly complicated or nuanced policy. The level of interpretation is pretty minimal.   I get the *intent,* but you can't govern solely off intent. A cash payout per child will undeniably be misused.   If the real implementation is, say, a WIC like program or childcare voucher or what have you, that potential plummets.
