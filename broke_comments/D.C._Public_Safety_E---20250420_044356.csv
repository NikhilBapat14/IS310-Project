"America always gets shit bass ackwards. ""Prevention"" would cost a fortune. Americans repeatedly reject it. Democrats lose on it.   Locking up criminals is as American as apple pie.  What we should do is focus on rehabilitation. Get in the system - for whatever reason - and your life will be changed. Not warehoused or punished in gulags. Opportunity. Life-changing outcomes. Individualized treatment for those who need it. We can afford that for a fraction of what it would cost to spend 20 years for every child in America trying to change the outcomes for an actual small percentage that get caught up in crime.    Our lives are made better when we ""lock 'em up."" Then we have a responsibility to make them better.",YallerDawg,2025-04-20T08:14:09,1
