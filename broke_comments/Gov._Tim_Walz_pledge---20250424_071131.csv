"Article snippet:  > ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Gov. Tim Walz pledged Wednesday night to do everything in his power to protect Minnesotans from the chaos that he said President Donald Trump has unleashed on the country and the world. >  > Delivering his annual State of the State speech to a joint session of the Legislature, the Democratic governor said Minnesota is as strong as it has ever been, but it is a “moment of great uncertainty for our nation.” And he said that is no accident, but the result of the Republican president's choices. >  > “The president of the United States has chosen – chosen! – to throw our economy into turmoil,” Walz said. >  > “Global markets are teetering on the brink of collapse,” he continued. “Businesses across this country and here in Minnesota are already laying off employees by the thousands. Working people are paying more for basic goods. And if you haven’t checked your 401(k) lately, don’t do it.”",progress18,2025-04-24T07:12:11,3
