"AMD started in Austin Texas back in 1981. Prior to that, they outsourced until they had the money to build in the US and until whenever they left the US.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-15T12:19:24,193
"Not to poo poo on the parade, but this was going to happen anyways regardless of the tariff position   I spent 2 years in that god awful hell hole and it was long known this was going to be the case.",Baptism-Of-Fire,2025-04-15T13:50:27,224
Truly sad that it takes this amount of pressure for an American company to manufacture in America.,BattleIllustrious680,2025-04-15T12:21:50,80

"Came here to say this, apparently someone didn't do their research as I seem to recall AMD ran their own manufacture in Texas and Dresden (that I know of) before they spun them off to create GlobalFoundries and became fabless.",Don_Alvarez,2025-04-15T13:03:08,121
Is this the line for every announcement like this?  What a coincidence that all these investments were going to happen anyway but just so happened to be announced after tariffs.,dunkeater,2025-04-15T13:52:31,-61
Others who posted said it was going to happen with or without tariffs and it's just a 'coincidence' the announcement is being made now.  The fab plant in AZ has been almost ready to go for some time now.,vampirepomeranian,2025-04-15T15:04:14,86
Only if you've been holding Intel stock lol.,vampirepomeranian,2025-04-15T13:45:01,37
"Yeah, nobody did any research for the article.  AMD actually had a fab in Sunnyvale starting in the early 70's which ultimately became a Superfund fund site that had to be remediated.",SeemoarAlpha,2025-04-15T14:36:39,49
"You really think that TSMC spent something like $100,000,000,000 to build a fab in Arizona back in 2021 because of these tariffs?     Don't get me wrong, I 100% support using tariffs to help US industry ... but that's not what's going on here.",DonkeyMilker69,2025-04-15T22:11:43,50
"its being announced because TSMC is almost ready to begin production at the new facility.  This will be the first commercial production for a client out of the fab. It had a lot of problems getting here, so premature announcement would only be bad for them if they encountered more delays.   And those delays were significant, and controversial on an international politics level.   again, long time coming.",Baptism-Of-Fire,2025-04-15T13:54:06,110
It has not been “almost ready” though they wanted to report that. Truth was Taiwan did everything it could to undermine American labor and send their own cheap labor here to build it and get stomped on every step of the way. The delays and corrupt government bureaucracy were insane. They had procurement teams in Taiwan double sourcing all labor and materials even under $5 lol   The original plan was to work with Intel since they’re local but that got the kabbosh thanks to Intel chest beating. That was 3 years ago. After that AMD was the next deal but it couldn’t go public until the fab was ready to produce.,Baptism-Of-Fire,2025-04-15T18:42:10,2
"love the news today ""Intel stocks gain as new Altera investment announced""  check stock, down 2.5%  cope lol",Baptism-Of-Fire,2025-04-15T14:08:43,6
I have a few friends that used to work at that fab in the late 90s in to the 2000s. I’m pretty sure they were making CPU’s.,jcr2022,2025-04-16T01:10:29,3
I know right - it was either Apple or AMD. AMD got the line priority a long time ago as TSMC is still schmoozing Apple.,Baptism-Of-Fire,2025-04-16T00:46:07,11
