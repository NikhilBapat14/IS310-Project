Womp. Womp. You go first. You were OK with others.   Trump shouldn't bail them out as we already payed for them to farm and send it out as USAID to promote the US. Bailing out costs us more as it's not even going anywhere.   Trump has trashed that and that America is about freedom (of speech) so fast.,No_Pirate9647,2025-04-24T20:13:28,1

"> Gibbs has spoken before about his frustration with Donald Trump’s decision to launch a trade war. Those tariffs all but guaranteed other countries would retaliate, targeting the country’s “soft underbelly.”  >“And what is that? That’s agriculture,” Gibbs insisted.  >To make matters worse, Gibbs argued, the administration then “raided our treasury and paid farmers the difference in hush money.” The Market Facilitation Program he’s referring to served as a backstop for farmers who saw the price of crops like soybeans plummet in response to the trade war. In all, the program cost $23 billion.",tech57,2025-04-24T20:01:37,1
