"""The family entered the US unlawfully and sought asylum and an immigration judge denied their claims.""  Why didn't it stop there? That's their due process, they aren't obligated anything more. Illegal aliens are not entitled to appeals much less their cases being kicked up to SCOTUS. Something is really broken here.",social_dinosaur,2025-04-18T06:58:20,149
"Crime is not a valid reason for asylum.  Asylum is for people who need shelter from their own governments, usually because they are members of a protected class.  This should have never made it's way to SCOTUS, it's a waste of the court's valuable time.",LatinNameHere,2025-04-18T10:46:24,21

">*Their legal team argued they face cartel violence if returned to Mexico.*  Okay? And? I hear El Salvador is quite nice these days.  The US is not open to 8 billion people, and if it takes this long to deport 4 people, then change the ""due process"" to accommodate the lack of due process it took to flood them in.",Right_Archivist,2025-04-18T07:47:44,53
"While I feel for the family and those involved, they didn't meet the eligibility requirements for asylum.   They were denied in 2021 and should have been sent back that very day.  Unfortunately, liberals want to use stall tactics to get people like this to stay",twhiting9275,2025-04-18T08:17:12,37

"Kagan denied the application without comment and did not refer the matter to her colleagues.  The petitioners, Fabian Lagunas Espinoza, Maria Angelica Flores Ulloa and their two sons, were ordered to report to immigration officials on Thursday. Their legal team argued they face cartel violence if returned to Mexico.  According to their court filing, the family fled Guerrero, Mexico, in 2021, after being threatened by the Los Rojos drug cartel. The petition stated that cartel members demanded the family vacate their home within 24 hours or be killed.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-18T08:37:20,11

"This needs to be looked at in the context of the 9-0 decision recently.    Even Kagan is saying, ""Sorry, no,"" regarding the Executive powers.  They only thing approaching an admonision in that decision was that they needed to follow due process and if needed to *facilitate* the return.    The meat of that decision did admonish the circuit judges that they had to respect the separation of powers and to *not* encroach on the Executives powers and decision.  Which seems to be getting ignored.",Celebril63,2025-04-18T11:22:33,3
Imagine where we'd be if Gerorge Washington and all the other patriots who fought the British crown decided to flee instead.,Panzershrekt,2025-04-18T09:06:16,5
"This is the entire tactic. Leftists want to gum up deportation via insisting on an absurd standard of ""due process"" where every single immigrant being deported insists on having their case taken all the way up to the SCOTUS.  It doesn't matter if they lose, there's millions of them. They simply have to buy time.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-18T08:06:34,73
"In fairness, by her actions, Justice Kagan agrees with you:  >Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan on Wednesday denied an emergency appeal by four Mexican nationals facing deportation. The request asked the court to temporarily block their removal so they could file a formal petition for review.   >Kagan denied the application without comment and did not refer the matter to her colleagues.",Kahnspiracy,2025-04-18T15:49:17,9

Next month SCOTUS is scheduled to rule on the authority of federal district judges. Hopefully they'll hand down a decision that limits them to the plaintiffs in the case and strips the national injunction application nonsense.,social_dinosaur,2025-04-18T08:16:10,39
