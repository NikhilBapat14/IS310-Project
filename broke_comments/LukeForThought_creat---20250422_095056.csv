He just uploaded it to Youtube: [https://youtu.be/p_LxNBr_noE?si=ZBItVpdH9P_lbo5_](https://youtu.be/p_LxNBr_noE?si=ZBItVpdH9P_lbo5_)  He said that this was actually his first post. He wanted to make videos like this in the future but felt the need to act faster than planned cause of what happens in the USA rn.,Morgentau7,2025-04-22T11:00:13,23
This should be required watching for every American.,annaleigh13,2025-04-22T11:06:14,23
"(Ach du schei…. Nee, Oder? First video??? Wahnsinn!)  This is excellent, doesn’t feel rushed, is informative, convincing, and so on point.  He most definitely should make more… imho.",10131013,2025-04-22T10:48:15,17
"Thank you for posting! I’m trying to find an associated YouTube channel to follow… not sure if you’re allowed to post the channel, but maybe some other info? Thank you!!",10131013,2025-04-22T10:36:24,12
"I believe this is the plan. The issue is where is the land coming from? Where are the materials coming from? Trump put tariffs on everything. The US can't get all the equipment to build this through the states. The tariffs will make it even more expensive to build.   I know this is the plan, but I can't help but think it's an impossible feat. It would also cost more to build prisons for cheap labor than it would just to let migrants work freely and pay taxes.  The cost to benefit ratio is not worth it. All this because Trump and Republicans are rasict? Is it just to be cruel? I just don't get it.",Monster_Dong,2025-04-22T14:26:30,3
He created an account on BlueSky. Nothing posted there yet.  https://bsky.app/profile/lukeforthought.bsky.social,Inevitable-Peace7,2025-04-23T09:25:32,3
That's an interesting point about the cost of deportation to el salvador and I agree with the general sentiments about fascism.  I'm a bit skeptical they have big plans on using prison labour though because it's not very good.  It'd be cheaper and more effective to just to leave things as they are in that case.,AltruisticSalamander,2025-04-22T11:55:26,4
"It’s good to have our eyes open to every possibility but I don’t think this will come about. I’m still glad people are out there thinking about these things and sharing.   The migrant round up is to make America “white” again. It doesn’t go much farther than that.  Forced labor camps on the scale described here aren’t feasible for many reasons.  While I do think we’re headed toward competitive authoritarianism, I do think we’re headed towards an actual Auschwitz.   The spectacle he describes here as a distraction is actually the point. They want to instill fear.  Later the scope will expand from illegal immigrants to legal immigrants (see Trumps challenge to birthright citizenship).  All of this is to remove the brown people.  Next they will find a way to shift their focus to black people. I don’t think they’ve shown us yet how they will make that transition.",zenmogwai,2025-04-22T19:11:51,1

Thanks! I bet he will read this when his Reddit Account is unbanned. They thought he is a bot.  Thats his youtube: Also just one vid. [https://youtu.be/p_LxNBr_noE?si=ZBItVpdH9P_lbo5_](https://youtu.be/p_LxNBr_noE?si=ZBItVpdH9P_lbo5_),Morgentau7,2025-04-22T10:57:56,12
He just texted me that Reddit actually banned his account today cause they thought it‘s spam. Hopefully his account will be reinstated.,Morgentau7,2025-04-22T10:42:39,14
"That was actually the very first video he ever created, thats why the edit feels a bit rushed. He said he will post it on Youtube soon but fears that it might be taken down. - I just met him on Reddit, thats how this connection happened.",Morgentau7,2025-04-22T10:38:57,4
"Trump just gave away your [forrest to timber production](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/immediate-expansion-of-american-timber-production/) and the ocean around Hawaii to fishing companies as well as oil fields to oil companies.  You have to understand this: It‘s not about the wealth of the nation, but the wealth of a few. The US might lose a part of it‘s wealth, but they wealthy have enough to compensate this, while the rest will fall. - This isn’t also just about wealth, it‘s about power and control.",Morgentau7,2025-04-22T14:39:14,7
He would have the military build the prisons.,Inevitable-Peace7,2025-04-23T00:32:11,3
Yeah he actually told me that TikTok banned his video and BlueSky just allows for videos of 4 min timespan. Pretty hard to get information out there if you don’t have a plattform it seems.,Morgentau7,2025-04-23T09:26:40,2
"As far as I understood Luke there is no other possibility. Deportations cost way too much, cheap labor would leave the country and the prisons are the only „middle ground“ between his racist followers and economic interests of his friends",Morgentau7,2025-04-22T12:02:15,4
"Why do you believe cost and efficiency are going to have anything to do with a plan that is very obviously simply about racism and cruelty?  The cheapest and most efficient “solution” to migrants, since every competent adult already knows this, is to let them keep doing what they’re doing: paying taxes via ITIN numbers into services they gain no benefit from, and then spending the rest of their dollars in local economies while balancing the birth shortage.  If we’re doing ANYTHING to up-end that, cost and efficiency cannot be part of the goals because those were the first thing the new policy has to kill.",Old_Baldi_Locks,2025-04-23T08:47:43,1
"tRump has never been the architect of policy. He is just the figurehead. A lot of this speed from Stephen Miller, other Nazis that tRump likes to have visit him, and their 2025 team. Though tRump does come up with plenty of stupid ideas that help distract us.",Inevitable-Peace7,2025-04-23T00:29:27,4

Or have the military oversee immigrant prisoners building their own prisons.,maximilliontee,2025-04-23T07:14:40,2
"We can suggest that bluesky expand the video limit. In the meantime, he can break his videos into numbered sequential segments. It's a really good platform to use as a base. Far better than something biased and filled with misinformation like TikTok. I don't even go there.",Inevitable-Peace7,2025-04-23T15:43:10,2
"Or there is no big plan and Trump is trying to sell the sizzle instead of the steak because there's no way to feasibly accomplish his mass deportation promises. Similar to DOGE's revisions down. Similar to his big caves on tariffs. Trump likes to dominate a media cycle or two, claim he did big things, hurt a few people really bad, but accomplish nothing of substance.",alliwanttodoislurk,2025-04-22T18:44:42,0
That would be great!,Morgentau7,2025-04-23T15:55:11,2
"You seem to underestimate the damage Trump did to the economy, the stock market and allied countries.  The stocks and yield bonds crashed, China just retaliated massively and Europe and many other allies are looking for alternatives to US trade.  Trump cant just call it off and everything will be fine again.  So he will have to pursue something else or this will cost him the mid terms.",Morgentau7,2025-04-22T18:54:17,4
"Oh, you're right. A lot of the damage is irreversible. Or, maybe, reversible only at great cost. I just meant that I'm not sure Trump has any intention of actually achieving what he claims his aims are, only in persuading the gullible.",alliwanttodoislurk,2025-04-22T19:34:29,0
