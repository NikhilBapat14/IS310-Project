"The initiative was blasted by veteran strategist James Carville, who called the plan ‚Äúthe most insane thing‚Äù he‚Äôd ever heard.  ‚ÄúHe is an officer of the Democratic National Committee‚Ä¶ And so he has a fiduciary duty to the Democratic Party, and he‚Äôs going to raise $20 million and primary Democrats?‚Äù Carville questioned.  ‚ÄúDoes he really think the problem that we‚Äòre facing in the United States today is because we got 65-year-old Democrats in office? Why don‚Äôt you take on a Republican? That‚Äòs your job,‚Äù he continued.  ‚ÄúHogg‚Äù, Carville thinks your plan is ‚Äúthe most insane thing‚Äù he‚Äôd ever heard!  You go Hogg wild!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-20T22:09:44,26
So‚Ä¶ where did this guy get 100k to just toss into a void?  This guy making money off of rallying to strip people of their rights is pretty insane.,icon0clast6,2025-04-20T20:39:42,143

"I agree with him, oddly, that the geriatric class needs to be punted firmly out of office at all levels.    But, on the other hand, this guys is obviously a whack job...so I'm not so sure I'd appreciate who he wants to install in their place.",Sangmund_Froid,2025-04-20T20:30:40,63
"This dork looks like Greta with a tan and a different wig.  At this point I'm imaging these douchey democrats are just clones from the same mold.  This one is ""pissed off and no where to direct it"" democrat.  In 5000 years he'll look like Bernie.  And over that course of time he will have accomplished nothing but grift personal wealth off the gullible.",Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-04-20T21:08:53,19

"And Hakeen Jeffries later came out and said he stands with his house incumbents.  Hopefully the infighting brings the whole left down by the time of the midterms, imagine if because of this we still barely hold the house by like 1 or 2 seats lol.",Rare_Cobalt,2025-04-20T21:58:20,6
"What else can Democrats do but implode and fracture?  They're a party without a platform so there's no single vision on virtually any political topic that they all share that's also important to voters.  They're not Democrats, they're anti-Republicans and most recently anti-Trump.  And Trump is unabashedly and proudly pro-American...which makes them assume stances and positions that are decidedly anti-American.   You can't be anti-American and hope to attain power through a fair vote when the guy you're against is succeeding with his pro-America policies.  You can't run on those issues.  So Hogg in his insipid ignorance will do what all other Democrats these days do and make the differences between people about identity.  In his case, he's choosing to make it about age.  It's a losing strategy but no less valid a losing strategy than making it about race, gender, religion or any of the other, myriad superficial differences Democrats are focused on while the country turns their back on their increasing irrelevance.  It's the natural progression of decline.  Hogg is just the messenger.",Euroranger,2025-04-21T06:03:47,4

"Should question where such a young guy gets 100k though. This isn't like 100k he made throughout the year, this is like 100k extra he has laying around?",QuietRedditorATX,2025-04-20T23:26:56,11
"All they need is a recession to gain total control over the federal government. They have no other path to victory. If Trump fails on the economy, he's basically handing the keys to the dems.",AU36832,2025-04-21T07:06:26,1
"To that I would say (respectfully, of course) ""duh"".  Americans have, and usually do, vote their pocketbook in the absence of other, greater issues.  Trump's entire approach these days is to indeed strengthen and enrich America's economy.  What he's doing now (essentially, isolating the corrosive effect of China on the entire world's economy and environment) has been needed for decades and while the transition away from China will cause short term pain, it will inevitably, create long term prosperity and wealth.  Might could even lead to actual Democracy in China eventually.  That all said, I think the recent revelations (particular those exposed by DOGE) will irrevocably alter how American's view ""big government"" and those parties that appear to want to grow that government.  If nothing else, the next 4 years will be interesting...to say the least.",Euroranger,2025-04-21T11:20:28,0
"I agree with the need to correct trade terms with much of the world. But if the execution leads to a recession, it will basically be for nothing. The democrats have gone so far to the left that we can't allow an easy victory for them.",AU36832,2025-04-21T11:26:41,1
"I'd suggest looking at the situation more as a ""what's good for America"" as opposed to ""what's good for Republicans"".  Honestly, the Republican party (until recently) has been nearly as anti-Trump as the Democrats and if Trump is anything, he's ""America First"" and doesn't really seem to care about the fortunes of the Republican party...only inasmuch as they're with him.  Trump is the sort of president this country hasn't seen since Teddy Roosevelt: he's setting the agenda and tone for the party and not the other way round.  Framing politics in the setting that we usually would simply doesn't add up when its Trump.  He's going to do what he thinks is best for the country first and the party second.  To all that, a recession is indeed possible but you're only looking at half the equation because while the economic impact of tariffs might arrive, there's also the extension on the tax breaks along with his position on not taxing tips, raising the rate on the highest bracket and so on that should offset the tariffs induced pain somewhat.  Personally, I believe the tariff controversy should be gone within 6 months at most.  Americans simply appear to not understand just how much of the global economy relies on our consumption.  Other countries mostly don't have the ability to stand on principle when faced with their factories scaling back and their workforces being reduced because their products aren't quite as in demand as they once were.  Most countries already see that a fairer trade arrangement with the United States is unavoidable and have moved to make that happen.  China's CCP is faced with an existential crisis though because they don't like to be seen bowing to the US while, at the same time, they recall rather vividly how close they came to losing control back in 1989.  China has given their citizens a taste of what it's like to live with western standards of living...while still denying them western style of having a say in their government.  That precarious balancing act lasts only as long as the western goodies continue and that will end rather quickly with American money being cut off.  At the end of the day, China will have no actual choice but to bow to a fairer trade arrangement unless they want to see nations like India and others swoop in and scoop their market shares.",Euroranger,2025-04-21T11:41:09,-1
