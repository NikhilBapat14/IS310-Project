"Sen. Peter Welch (VT) visited Mahdawi in prison - an X link containing their interview is in article link.   A few powerful statements from the interview:  ""He \[Sec. Marco Rubio\] is describing being anti-war as antisemitic. How could that be possible when my partners, most of my partners, at Columbia's campus and beyond, are Jews and Israelis?""  ""My empathy extends to the Jews and the Israelis. And my hope and my dream is to see this conflict...to see an end to the war, an end to the killing, to see a peaceful resolution between Palestinians and Israelis.""   Perhaps the most powerful quote of all:  **“How could \[my activism\] be a threat to anybody except the war machine that is feeding this?”**  Rubio couldn't care less about antisemitism, Israel, and Palestine - he needs to protect the U.S. elite and the overall military-industrial complex that profits off of war. Remember, both RTX and General Dynamics spoke openly during Q3 2023 earnings calls how good Gaza was to their ultimate bottom line.   Big props to Welch for meeting with him. Pressure on your local Congressional leadership works.",walkallover1991,2025-04-22T17:47:38,6
