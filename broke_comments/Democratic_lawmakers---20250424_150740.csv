Finally Mr. Romero’s story is getting more light! Hope he’s still alive and ok as he can be.,Sevren425,2025-04-24T15:29:49,19
"Good. If the party is worried about pursuing CECOT advocacy in terms of ‘losing ground’ and votes or what not, then I honestly believe they’re doing the general public a disservice. Andry’s case is not only sympathetic, it also exposes the absurdity of trump administration, DHS, and ICE. No one possessed of even a little reason is going to look at Andry’s pictures and social media and buy that he’s a hardened, dangerous TdA member. Absurd. And then it throws every single case of CECOT detainment into further question.  Keep pushing!  Editing to include appreciation for Representative Robert Garcia! I feel he may have to push to include Andry’s name in their public/press advocacy while visiting El Salvador and I’m damn proud of him. ",Calm_Pudding2684,2025-04-24T16:27:37,12
