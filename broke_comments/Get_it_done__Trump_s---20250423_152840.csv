"Crimea has been taken from Ukraine for more than 10 years now. Also doesn't help that the population approves the leadership under Russia than Ukraine. (The latest survey reported more than 80% of Crimea's population supported the move. (From Levada Center, a non-government organization.))",cambodianerd,2025-04-23T17:09:06,23
"Well the brigading downvoters have arrived.... to what? offer any sort of argument? Of course not.  The news item above simply says what happened today.  Simply put, I think we all wish this war were coming to a different conclusion, but it is reaching some sort of conclusion. But this idea by some that this war is going to end with no concessions, with some absolute victory by Ukraine over Russia, all the way to the Crimea being in Ukrainian hands is fantasy.  The argument could be made that Zelensky possibly thinks that offering any sort of concession may lead to pressure towards further concessions... but there is a point where some realism is required.  If the US were to just pull out... is the solution then to bank everything in the pursuit of that same total victory on European support?  What exactly is the endgame here? No one can tell us, they've never been able to tell us. Only wishful thinking while insulting everyone else and their intelligence.  If it's another 10 years until more of Ukraine is destroyed, at the cost of the US and EU taxpayer to make some fruitless point, many will say to count themselves out. The fantasy of a Ukrainian Crimea may be important to some people with their 5 houses and no skin in the game, less so for an ailing generation that can barely pay rent for one.",SlightWerewolf4428,2025-04-23T17:03:25,-8
The guy wants to have martial law as long as the war lasts while he also wants to fight a forever war.  And trying to join our alliance mid-war.,D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-23T16:26:14,-10
"If Zelenskyy screws this up I say we just let Russia have Ukraine.   I’m not interested in fighting a proxy war for an egotistical little tyrant.  Edit: hi leftie brigaders. Historically you’ve been anti war and bitched every time we’ve gotten involved. Now you’re for war because, well, Trump. You’re hypocrites.",dottedoctet,2025-04-23T18:32:35,-15

"Fuck Zelensky. I don’t wish any harm whatsoever to the Ukrainian people but Zelensky and Biden are 100% responsible for this situation. They knew the stakes, gambled and have crapped out. Zelensky has been given chance after chance but he’s clearly not seeking peace and toying with the rest of the world.",Flare4roach,2025-04-23T20:57:48,-11

"There's no doubt now, Zelensky WANTS World War 3. The Europeans are too dumb to realize they are being taken along for a ride by the 'masters that be'...again for the third time.     I'm so ashamed to think my ancestors were once part of proud colonial empires on that continent... now reduced to nothing more than socialist war-mongering blowhards.",AldrichOfAlbion,2025-04-23T19:39:53,-23
People don't realize that Putin only needs to release a low level nuke like an artillery nuke and this will be over. And I wouldn't put it past him to do it. Ukraine cannot win unfortunately. They just can't. This isn't like World War II where we could just go in. Nukes are on the table.,BossJackson222,2025-04-23T22:14:19,-20

"Frankly, I feel like this has become an issue that is no longer worth devoting any resources toward. Zelensky isn’t interested in looking at reality - Ukraine can’t win and is going to be in a worse position if they keep fighting because they just don’t have enough manpower. Russia isn’t going to walk away having given anything of consequence back and may not actually be willing to stop anyway. The US doesn’t actually have a reason to be involved - it just makes no difference to the US even if Russia completely annexed Ukraine. I think it’s time to just drop it and let the Europeans handle it with the understanding that we’re not riding in to rescue them if they get themselves in a bind later. I understand what he said on the campaign trail but I don’t think most of us are going to be all that upset that he tried and it didn’t work out.",deadzip10,2025-04-24T06:50:54,-6
"Historically, Crimea was occupied by the Tatars, but since the early days of the Soviet Union has been majority Russian.  At no point have Ukrainians ever been more than a small minority of Crimea's population.  Which is why Crimea was perfectly happy when Russia took them over again. ",BoredAtWork1976,2025-04-23T19:00:22,4
What brigading downvotes? Some posts are definitely brigaded but this is doesn’t appear to be. Just stirring up fake controversy.,DandierChip,2025-04-23T18:32:23,44
"The strategy from the start, unstated but clear as day, has been to bleed Russia in the hopes that it would collapse and Putin would be ousted before Ukraine was bled dry.  Problem is that the longer this drags on the more it looks like Ukraine will be the first to fold.   The people who cheered that Putin was gonna be overthrown when the Wagner group got antsy, and then had their hopes dashed when reality set in, are now comforting themselves by saying that even if Ukraine loses, at least Russia got hurt.  As if that will be any comfort to the hundreds of thousands of grieving families in Ukraine when this war reaches its inevitable, but delayed, conclusion.",Shadeylark,2025-04-24T11:24:51,-1
"Too many people who predicate their moral righteousness based on how many Russians die, nevermind the cost in Ukrainian lives, for this to have ever not been a western problem.",Shadeylark,2025-04-24T11:27:35,2

"Not to mention to all of the money lost by people working for companies affected, or indeed the Europeans living in countries that relied on Russian gas, or the many more affected by the raging inflation that ensued.  But all those that didn't think about, those downvoting people who dare mention any of this: congrats! You're the fools that will fall for anything!",SlightWerewolf4428,2025-04-24T11:40:01,1
