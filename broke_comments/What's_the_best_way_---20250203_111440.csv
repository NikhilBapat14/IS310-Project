"Follow historian Heather Cox Richardson on Substack or Facebook. She writes a daily post summarizing things, puts it in historical context, and includes sources.",SkillfulFishy,2025-02-03T14:41:12,17
"Not to be flippant... but its going to be tough as fast as things are moving.  Given Trump and Trudeau have a call at 3p eastern today, the entire ""trade war with Canada and Mexico"" could be over by EOD.  Best bet would probably be finding two good news sources - the Economist is a good place to start, but also look at right-leaning media as well (you can find versions/evaluations cross the internet.  Here's [Allsides's](https://www.allsides.com/media-bias/media-bias-chart) breakdown.)  I'd also throw in a bit more opinion sites, especially those that tend to update their news more frequently.  Again, both sides so you can get an idea of what each is focusing on.  Reddit, unfortunately, is probably too slow right now to really track things.  One of the top stories right now is the stock market falling but after the resolution with Mexico, its recovered almost all its loses.  Its just the way reddit is designed.",AuditorTux,2025-02-03T11:52:57,9
The whole point is to overwhelm you so you can't follow them.  See this video by Ezra Klein for an explainer on what they're trying to do: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&ab\_channel=TheEzraKleinShow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&ab_channel=TheEzraKleinShow),ansius,2025-02-06T03:32:25,2
Her daily posts are also cross-posted to r/HeatherCoxRichardson. Her Political Chats and talks on YT are also worth listening to.,stoicsticks,2025-02-03T21:36:17,3

"She, herself, is not on reddit, but one of the moderators posts her Letters From an American. She mentioned that she is doing more on YT lately to get the word out.   Her recent Sunday, Feb 2nd Political Chat is a good one with steps on what people can do to make a difference. It is especially chilling, and she is clanging the proverbial 5 alarm fire alarm after Musk took over the Treasury, kicked out the head of the Treasury and gave 6 IT young adults access to every American's personal information. All of it - your banking info, addresses, everything.  https://youtu.be/6Xzjqr495EI?si=m-sojgRqq1H2Jmg_",stoicsticks,2025-02-04T02:59:08,3
