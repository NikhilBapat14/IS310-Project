A standalone version of that bill had already passed the House and is basically waiting for the Senate.  [For nine months](https://x.com/greg_price11/status/1870141093804945518).  Why don't Schumer and the Democrats want to fund it?  They control the Senate.,LordFoxbriar,2024-12-20T16:20:06,13
"Mostly because of timing and Senate rules and procedures. It is not easy to just put a bill up for a vote.  Being a supermajority chamber, it means the Senate gets bogged down easily with how long it takes to pass individual bills. Even ones that are extremely popular. There are also precedents and traditions still upheld by leadership. We don't know if theres a hold on it from a single senator or if the agreement was for it to pass in larger legislative package.",askewedview,2024-12-20T17:35:11,20
That's why it's confusing.,BigNickers6,2024-12-20T16:34:59,5
"I'm also tired of thinking that with Sinema and that WV bastard whose name I forgot, the Dems actually have a majority.  On paper maybe, but in practice this is perhaps the weakest majority and you can definitively point to those two.",Ent3rpris3,2024-12-20T18:36:04,16
">Mostly because of timing and Senate rules and procedures. It is not easy to just put a bill up for a vote.  Nine months.  Nine months.  Nine, freaking, months.  Don't tell me procedure and all kept them from picking up a bill for *sick children* and getting it passed.",LordFoxbriar,2024-12-21T08:22:09,-2
Looks like it’s currently under committee consideration,Macslionheart,2024-12-20T17:37:21,5
"That’s the fun part of it all. Even if you have 60 votes, a majority leader can’t count on them 100 percent of the time.",askewedview,2024-12-20T19:29:55,8
The act is called “Burying it in committee”.,Puzzleheaded-Home334,2024-12-20T20:05:33,5
"Please go clutch your pearls elsewhere then. I'm giving a factual answer as to why this chamber is unable to pass individual bills, even when immensely popular.   This Congress has passed only 82 bills into law for the past two years. That is historically low even by modern standards. So yes, blame can be centered on the Senate itself for this policy failure. Because all 100 Senators continue to operate in this way and refuse to change their rules for faster consideration.",askewedview,2024-12-21T08:34:21,10
But it did? do you think they do not want to pass it? what are you bitching about here?,Threash78,2024-12-22T17:33:58,2
[You mean that bill they *just* passed](https://x.com/EricLDaugh/status/1870290271381917823) because it got attention?  Funny how they were able to pass it so quickly once it was noted it was waiting for them to the public and your vaunted processes could be speed up.,LordFoxbriar,2024-12-21T09:05:18,-7
They are not my vaunted processes despite your smugness. It’s the chambers rules. It’s the reality in how they operate. We know the Senate can act fast when put under pressure. As you so linked to final passage of this bill.   I’m very happy it was able to be passed. But there are countless other worthy programs that weren’t able to be enacted or funded because they couldn’t get that level of attention. The Senate rules need to be overhauled to better allow for these kinds of bills to actually make it for a final vote.,askewedview,2024-12-21T09:59:29,11
You just linked info stating Rand Paul had it stuck in committee. What conclusion are you coming to?,WanderingLost33,2024-12-22T13:00:16,2
"> It’s the reality in how they operate. We know the Senate can act fast when put under pressure. As you so linked to final passage of this bill.   Even if it had been the original CR, it would have had to been passed quickly.  It can be done.  The Senate just either needs to *want* to do it or is *pressured* to do it.  >But there are countless other worthy programs that weren’t able to be enacted or funded because they couldn’t get that level of attention.   Go out and name them.  Point it out.  The problem is that too many people don't follow that sort of stuff and the Senate is happy to sit back and argue rather than get to work.",LordFoxbriar,2024-12-21T10:02:02,-4
"Yes, it can be done. But it can’t be done every time something needs to pass.   The problem is that pressure is the only way they operate. You cannot get all 100 Senators to agree to unanimous consent agreements for everything.   In a chamber that ranges from Bernie Sanders to Mike Lee, someone is going to put a hold on something and slow everything else down. It’s just the way the chamber has evolved over its history. And that impacts a lot of legislative activity for whoever is in charge.",askewedview,2024-12-21T10:06:59,3
