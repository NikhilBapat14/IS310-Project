So? Walk away.  The current deal requires Ukraine to give up all the land Russia has seized.   Ukraine should tell us to pound sand.,muchnycrunchny,2025-04-23T11:13:26,30
The U.S. has already walked away. The adults are now in the room. Trump and Vance will go down in history as selling out to Putin.,JFJinCO,2025-04-23T11:21:52,12

He is complicit in Putin's international version of a brutal home invasion aggravated by murder and kidnapping. He is nothing more than this.,TieVast8104,2025-04-23T11:16:14,5
Been a longggg 24 hours. So long they‚Äôre just going to give up. #winning,Immediate_Theory4738,2025-04-23T11:14:39,4
Walk away? You want to give Russia everything it wants and if that doesn't work you want to rage quit? Bunch of bratty toddlers.,TheJadeGoddess,2025-04-23T11:22:47,4
"Zelenskyy replies ""don't let the door hit your fat, pope-killing ass on the way out.""  Clearly, Putin is desperate to end this war, and I think Zelenskyy realizes it. If he can just get enough support from Europe, he can grind it out.  And now Trump has shot his shot. If it lands with a dud Europe is going to realize they can take on Russia by themselves.",NoOneStranger_227,2025-04-23T11:57:57,4
Sounds like that‚Äôs a ‚Äúgo‚Äù for Ukraine to re-nuclearize as US has abandoned the legal treaty to protect it.¬†,femme_mystique,2025-04-23T11:28:58,3
You mean there isn't peace in Ukraine? I thought all that shit was solved several months ago in a 24-hour period...  https://apnews.com/article/trump-russia-ukraine-war-un-election-a78ecb843af452b8dda1d52d137ca893,sniffstink1,2025-04-23T11:30:31,3

"When America was scared and desperate to secure nuclear materials during the Terrorism Wars, Ukraine answered the call.  The US got everything and all it wanted from Ukraine.  20 years later, it‚Äôs Ukraine who?",5minArgument,2025-04-23T16:01:17,2
"They should be reminded the United States shouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúwalk away‚Äù from problems like cowards, but they are arguing in bad faith and merely trying to effectuate an outcome that benefits Russia. Putin wants to rape, bomb and steal his way into Ukraine‚Äôs sovereign territory and Vance is playing the idiot who throws up his hands and goes, ‚Äúargh, both of you!

Trump gets revenge on Zelensky for not backing his Biden claims.  Remember the perfect phone call? ¬† /s,fairoaks2,2025-04-23T11:24:38,13
"Another case of him just saying anything to get elected.  We could print out a list a mile long filled with these types of wildly untruthful campaign claims and show them his voters, and they wouldn't care, because apparently nothing matters to them except their guy winning.",RealGianath,2025-04-23T11:51:04,5
"Sadly, I think that he actually means it.  The idea that he is a great dealmaker is core to his self-worth and self-image.  He constantly refers to this.  But he actually sucks at negotiation.  He isn't even mediocre at it, he is just bad at it.  Here, he violated one of the first rules of negotiation: He made it clear that he could not afford to walk away empty-handed.    That is never a good idea.  But it is particularly dumb when dealing with a maximalist such as Putin who will always try to pull everything to his side of the table and never try to find a middle ground.  These guys are hacks.  The Democrats should belittle them for it.  Americans across the board assume that the GOP is the better party for business and national security.  It should be the primary objective of the Democrats to take those branding messages for themselves, while mocking the GOP for being incompetent at both.",I405CA,2025-04-23T11:56:58,7
