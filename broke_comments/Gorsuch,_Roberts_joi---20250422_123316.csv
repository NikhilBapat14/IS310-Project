"This has very little to do with immigration and deals with how deadlines are measured.  If the deadline ends on a holiday, the deadline is the next day that it not a holiday.  Not sure why it would go to SCOTUS",goinsouth85,2025-04-22T15:46:56,36
">The Supreme Court ruled, with the backing of Roberts and Gorsuch, that any voluntary departure deadlines for immigrants under the 60-day departure time frame that fall on a weekend or on a legal holiday in the U.S. should be extended to the next business day.   It's a serious mental leap to think that a ruling on business days or holidays would extend to other parts of immigration law.",squunkyumas,2025-04-22T12:41:45,49
"You can never know which way Roberts goes, but Gorsuch has been a pretty consistent originalist conservative on the bench.  I suspect this is just a pause and they will rule correctly when it counts.  But you never know until you know.",mdws1977,2025-04-22T13:11:25,10
"Over whether a filing was due on a Saturday, or allowed to be filed on the Monday... has allowed this guy who said he would self-deport an additional 4-years (when given a sixty-day window)?  What does getting remanded do?  I hope when it is remanded, that they say ""times up"" and put him on a plane.  No voluntary deportation, no additional sixty days, don't pass go and collect $200 outside a home depot.",j3remy2007,2025-04-23T07:29:36,1
"I agree with “yumas”, I’m actually glad it is trivial, or maybe to some it is not. Extending by one day, this rule, if the rule ends on the last day being a holiday or weekend it is not a big deal to me to extend it one day!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-22T16:49:44,3
Roberts generally goes in the direction that favors process.  He and Barrett are both something of process geeks.,Celebril63,2025-04-22T14:23:47,21

I think the democrats must have abused the CIA and FBI to get compromising materials on some of these justices while Biden was president and now they are calling in those favors.,OzoneLaters,2025-04-22T14:37:54,-10
