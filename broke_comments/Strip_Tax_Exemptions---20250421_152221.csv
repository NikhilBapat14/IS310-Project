I believe churches should not be tax exempt either if they are advancing political agendas like they are with the border. Lets make it fair and no exemptions anymore. Non profits are corrupt. NGOs are anything but Non Government Organizations.,kaytin911,2025-04-21T15:37:41,354
"No, who decides what is woke, remember Obama did that to churches. I'll decide what is woke and the government. Now NGOs are a different story and should not be Tax exempt. I work for a non profit and we're not woke, so what happens is some one decided it was woke",baseball_Lover33,2025-04-21T16:00:33,122
There is something strange about the Feds giving billions of dollars to a private institution. If there were no alternatives it would make sense but there most certainly are lots and lots of perfectly good public alternatives who should be getting those billions.,Bamfor07,2025-04-21T16:27:26,-4
Do you really want the government looking at all the sermons for all the churches all over the country trying to determine which sermon is biblically justified vs political?  Sounds like a nightmare very ripe for abuse to me.,RedditThrowaway-1984,2025-04-21T17:13:49,-18

woke is quite simply too subjective and not a real thing. we can't build real ideology off of being anti-woke. there needs to be something more concrete,burninator3343,2025-04-21T18:19:37,95
I would rather there be no tax exemptions for any of it and lower taxes for all to compensate.,kaytin911,2025-04-21T17:16:48,147
That gets tricky due to the separation of church and state issue.  It might be unconstitutional to tax churches.,RedditThrowaway-1984,2025-04-21T17:19:43,-74
I don't remember anything in the constitution that says so as long as it does not favor any particular religion. I could be missing something. I dislike any special taxes to promote behavior like cigarette taxes.  I checked and there is no constitutional reason for churches to be tax exempt.,kaytin911,2025-04-21T17:22:52,94
