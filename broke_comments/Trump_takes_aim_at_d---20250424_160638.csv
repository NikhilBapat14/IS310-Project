"It's actblue.   WASHINGTON—President Trump is targeting Democrats’ main fundraising platform, in an extraordinary effort to challenge the opposing party’s political infrastructure.   Trump is planning to sign a memorandum Thursday that directs Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate ActBlue, which revolutionized liberal fundraising by giving small-dollar donors an easy way to contribute to campaigns and causes.    Three Republican-led congressional committees alleged this month that ActBlue has “a fundamentally unserious approach to fraud prevention.” GOP lawmakers have demanded additional documents related to a string of recent resignations by top executives.   The committees have stopped short of accusing ActBlue of violating federal law, which prohibits contributions from foreign nationals and governments in U.S. elections.   ActBlue has emerged as the dominant fundraising hub for Democrats in recent years, giving them a significant advantage over Republicans with small-dollar fundraising. The platform collected nearly $3.8 billion in individual contributions during the 2023-24 campaign cycle, according to its filings with the Federal Election Commission.  A summary of Trump’s memo reviewed by The Wall Street Journal makes no mention of WinRed, a prominent Republican online fundraising platform that was designed to replicate Democrats’ success with small-dollar fundraising. It collected about $1.6 billion from individuals during 2023-24, federal records show.  ActBlue executives have prepared for the memo for days, according to people close to the group. “Nothing will deter or interrupt ActBlue’s mission and work to enable millions of Americans to participate in our democracy,” ActBlue wrote to Democrats ahead of the release of Trump’s memo.  Billionaire Elon Musk, a Trump ally who has led the cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency, has criticized ActBlue in recent social-media posts. “Something stinks about ActBlue,” he wrote in March.  Democrats said they were alarmed by the memo.  “Anytime a president is attempting to inflict harm on his political opponents’ ability to campaign, it’s definitely concerning,” said Kenneth Pennington, a partner at Middle Seat, a Democratic digital fundraising firm.   The memo is one prong of a far-reaching effort by Trump and his allies to take on Democrats, prominent critics of the president and other Republican opponents.   Trump signed an executive order last month against Perkins Coie, a law firm with deep Democratic ties. The order stripped the firm’s employees of security clearances, limited their access to federal buildings and instructed agencies to end federal contracts with the firm.   Trump has signaled his administration will examine the tax-exempt status of liberal watchdog groups such as Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, also known as CREW, which is challenging some of the administration’s actions in court.   “CREW’s a charitable organization, and that’s a political thing,” Trump said during a speech at the Justice Department in March.   The Trump administration has also requested that the Internal Revenue Service start the process of revoking Harvard University’s tax-exempt status, as part of a campaign against elite colleges.",Professional_Set4137,2025-04-24T16:42:39,1
This would imply Donald Trump and his allies will ever allow democrats to ever be allowed to be in a position of power.,megaben20,2025-04-24T20:20:03,1
