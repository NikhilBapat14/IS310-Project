"Stephen A is fucking awful. I've always hated him as a sportscaster. He has very little real knowledge about the sports he covers but instead personal drama and beef into the games to spice up the coverage.  American democracy is doomed anyway, since elections are popularity contests, and TV personalities always have a leg up in this.

"If you mean a populist candidate, then yes. . .   Way back in 2016.  Bernie was an outsider and the DNC didn't like him. The DNC favoured Hilary who lost to Trump.  Funnily enough, Bernie Sanders won several of the same states in the primary that swung the election to Trump in the general that year.  It's certainly not a sure thing, but had the DNC been more supportive during the primary and given Bernie a fairer shot, he may very well have defeated Trump before this mess started.",lordagr,2025-04-22T03:23:24,4

"This is what the media wants, not the people. They're extremely worried about the possibility of going back to boring old safe politics because then they can't keep pumping out their lazy back and forth circus articles for easy clicks. They *loved* all the attention and business Trump gave them with his insane bs, and are now worried about the public tiring of the instability and chaos and possibly turning back to normal candidates in the future.

"No they have not. Stephen A. Smith doesn’t even have the balls to call Trump fascist, or properly acknowledge his authoritarianism. He can shit talk, sure, but his policy decisions will be just as weak as every other establishment democrat.

"I really hate this line, and if your selling point is ""we are boring,"" democrats really need to work on their messaging. Politics shouldn't be boring.

But entertainment news commentary panels by the big-advertising partners of big-lobbying want a well-acquainted cable TV industry insider to protect their media monopoly and very expensive political PAC profit streams.,postsshortcomments,2025-04-22T05:09:12,5

"IMO Bernie was not going to win either.  Not for any policy reason, but because the right wing media has painted him as a socialist.   That being said, a candidate that holds those views and can avoid the label of socialist would be a winning candidate.  That and someone who doesn't get sidetracked by whatever culture war bullshit the GOP cooks up that week.   Like the current Trans sports BS.  It should always be a 'of course children should be allowed to participate in sports.  But what we should really be discussing is [insert popular policy that actually helps people]'",L_obsoleta,2025-04-22T04:24:47,-1

"> Politics shouldn't be boring.   Couldn't disagree more, respectfully. Pushing form over substance has been key to getting us to where we are today. I'll take thoughtful, measured governance from a politician with a low 'Q' score any day.   Of course that's never going to happen in the US but one can be hopeful.",biscuitarse,2025-04-22T08:19:14,3
"But if democrats pick a TV personality and Republicans pick another TV personality in 4 years and so on so on, it becomes a vicious circle and the US will never have a normal politician as president again. There has to be a point when this madness stops.",KareenTu,2025-04-22T05:30:53,6
Because some people love their conspiracy nonsense.,DaveChild,2025-04-22T04:58:51,-1
"IMO the problem with Trump is not that he's a TV personality.  The problem is he's a narcissist bigoted hateful TV personality who will never admit they were wrong and appears to want to stay in the job for life because they fear being jailed if they lose office.  Pretty sure John Stewart doesn't want the job but I reckon he'd be pretty good, and he'd listen to expert advisers.  Reagan was also a TV personality and although I disagree with his policy positions he was a fairly effective politician.",Dr_Hexagon,2025-04-22T05:46:59,2
Reagan was a movie personality who had significant political experience (union head and governor of California).  Not to defend Reagan. But there’s a difference between a tv personality and a tv personality who has significant experience with governing.,xyz_rick,2025-04-22T10:02:45,1
