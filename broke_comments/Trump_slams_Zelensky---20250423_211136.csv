"""It’s inflammatory statements like Zelenskyy’s that makes it so difficult to settle this War,” Trump wrote.   Trump definitely had someome write this for him. No way he knows that word.",ColeBeasleyMD,2025-04-23T21:15:27,35

Marco Rubio is a complete piece of crap and I am shocked that he has a political career after his run for president in 2016(for which he didn’t even advance pass the primaries),animalslover4569,2025-04-23T21:24:08,15

"Trump just wants a win.  He wants to take credit for a ""peace"" deal. The terms don't matter to him. He just wants praise for ending the war.  Zelensky by refusing to cede his own country is a turd in the punch bowl to Trump.",Turbulent_Juice_Man,2025-04-23T21:21:58,12
That's not a deal for Ukraine.  It's a complete surrender.    Marco Rubio is a traitor.  After all the years of  anti communist political prisoner rhetoric  he turns around and illegally imprisons political prisoners for a wannabe dictator.,rickythepilot,2025-04-23T21:31:21,11

"It was never close. Trump is putting Zelenskyy in an impossible position so that when he rejects the offer he can spin the narrative to Zelenskyy being uncooperative. Same thing with the tariffs. Cause a problem for other countries so he can offer to 'solve it' seemingly putting the US in a stronger negotiating position.  That strategy isn't going to work for tariffs or Ukraine, people can see right through it. 👍",-CJF-,2025-04-23T22:38:00,5
