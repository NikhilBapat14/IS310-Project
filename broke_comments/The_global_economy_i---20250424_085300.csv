Amazing how one of the dumbest people alive can have such an impact on the world's economy.,Colonel-Mooseknuckle,2025-04-24T08:56:33,6
What pisses me off is some MAGA asshats in a few swing states have put me and a large percentage of the world’s population in a less secure and prosperous position.  That is not right.  How Wisconsin votes should not impact me.,TubeframeMR2,2025-04-24T08:58:34,7
They'll start another war before they allow the stock market to crash. It's how the wealthy steal from the average people. America is corrupt ,Other-Net-3262,2025-04-24T09:29:12,2

">U.S. President Donald Trump wasted no time implementing his agenda as his second Oval Office term commenced. As part of his “Make America Great Again” policies, Trump has shredded the playbooks that have governed international trade and, indeed, the world order for decades.    >His erratic, and often confusing, [rollout of tariffs](https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-TRUMP/TARIFFS/movayyxzjva/) has hit countries ranging from the largest U.S. trading partners, like Canada, Mexico and China, right down to tiny icy islands inhabited only by penguins. The result - almost unprecedented market volatility and serious damage to investor trust in U.S. assets.   >The mighty S&P 500 is flirting with bear-market territory**,** while the dollar falls toward four-year lows. More worryingly from the point of view of broader market stability, U.S. Treasuries, the bedrock of the global financial system, are bruised from one of their worst selloffs in decades. ",YesterShill,2025-04-24T08:53:33,1
