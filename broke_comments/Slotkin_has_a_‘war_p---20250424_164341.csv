what an idiotic perspective,RoachedCoach,2025-04-24T16:44:34,1
"Once again, centrist Dem tries to stand up to Trump by agreeing with everything Mitt Romney says. ",crashonthehighway,2025-04-24T16:53:46,1
Astroturfed republicans lite bs. Of course the “i like reagan over trump” lady would say that,Automatic-Wonder-299,2025-04-24T16:45:38,1
">Her strategy also focuses on language and tone. She said Democrats should stop using the term “oligarchy,” a phrase she said doesn’t resonate beyond coastal institutions, and just say that the party opposes “kings.” And to beat their weak and woke rap, Democrats should channel the “no-bullshit” energy of the Lions’ Campbell, she said, “A wonderfully sappy guy with his players,” but who is also “smart and tough and lovable.”  Fuck off.   How's that language and tone?  Dumbing down and heading toward the right brought us to this spectacular mess that we all get to live in now. So, how about no and again, fuck off.",pgm_01,2025-04-24T17:04:34,1
"FFS, I do not need anybody lecturing to me with bullshit about alpha energy.  All Slotkin is doing is parroting the bullshit rhetoric spewed by MAGA.   By doing so, she is bolstering their bullshit narrative about Democrats.",ResidentKelpien,2025-04-24T17:11:14,1
look at my political opposition dawg,Low_Firefighter5849,2025-04-24T16:45:48,1
She's in the wrong party.,12PoundCankles,2025-04-24T17:06:18,1
And here I thought the Democrats were going to be completely fucking useless.  Silly me.,incide666,2025-04-24T16:59:28,1
She paid a 4chan troll in cheeto dust to come up with that one.,Rotanen,2025-04-24T16:51:42,1
God she sucks.,RocketSocket765,2025-04-24T17:56:41,1
Be an authoritarian white supremacist/Christian Nationalist?   Nope.,No_Pirate9647,2025-04-24T16:57:46,1
Dems need to stop with this focus group bs and just be their authentic selves. Learn from the master Pete Butiegieg or Uncle Bernie.,DraganTaveley,2025-04-24T17:59:53,1
"There's a very noticeable avoidance of describing what is meant as ""woke"" in that article.  If she means defending all people's rights full throatedly in a strong manner I agree.  If she means ""avoid talking about trans and minority issues while republicans attack them""  then she looks weak.",KingThar,2025-04-24T16:48:54,1

"Centrists are out. Did she not get the memo? It’s better to be woke than weird. The last thing we need is another Manchin or Sinema. Also, if you can say Daenerys Targaryen you can pronounce oligarchy.",Anitabigloan,2025-04-24T19:59:42,1
"She's right on the weak part, Democrats do need to stop going for the safe pick that they've gone with the past three elections.  Bernie is too old at this point, but if he would have ran and lost in 2016 or 2024 it wouldn't have changed anything, but it at least would have tested the waters if America was ready to elect someone like Bernie or an AOC in the future.",twovles31,2025-04-24T17:10:45,1
"James Carville getting \*really\* lucky one time in '92 and preaching his ""Republican-lite"" ideology among the Dem consultant class has resulted in catastrophic damage to our society",TheCowrus,2025-04-24T17:51:59,1
"Funny that she regularly uses the term “oligarch” to refer to Russian billionaires, but when it comes to the scumbags destroying our country, that “doesn’t resonate”",defaultedup,2025-04-24T17:18:20,1
It doesn't even make any sense. How can you say this with a straight face as Bernie and AOC draw giant crowds in middle American \*specifically\* talking how bad oligarchy is?,InfinityComplexxx,2025-04-24T17:57:09,1
She's not entirely wrong. Many Americans don't even know what oligarchy means. It's too big of a word for a barely literate population.,Scarlettail,2025-04-24T17:17:47,1
"Nah. She's perfect for what the Dems have come to represent. Another milquetoast centrist who'll speak down to her supporters while buddying up to the right, under the (bullshit) pretense that she fighting from within.",DocShocker,2025-04-24T17:52:07,1
"Also ""defeating Donald Trump in 2028"" is just a matter of making sure he can't run again",KingThar,2025-04-24T16:57:10,1
Maybe the consultant class is actually just the whole fucking problem.,CrankyVince2,2025-04-24T18:20:58,1
Probably because she's an heiress to a fucking hot dog company.,Pike_Gordon,2025-04-24T18:55:59,1
"I worry she is trying to protect the ""rich and powerful"" by focusing on Trump as a King.  If we dont address the power oligarchs have what's the point?",KingThar,2025-04-24T17:22:51,1
"You can teach people the meaning of things - it wasn't that long ago that DEI and CRT were virtually unknown to the population. Meanwhile Bernie and AOC are drawing five figure crowds in red states for the ""Fight Oligarchy"" tour.",sexygodzilla,2025-04-24T19:53:16,1
Oh I agree with that. What I mean is we need to replace those people with people who aren't useless.,12PoundCankles,2025-04-24T17:54:25,1
The consultant class takes money from the donor class.,moldivore,2025-04-24T18:23:47,1
"Democratic leaders referring to Trump as a ""king"" would not only be a massive messaging failure, it would be a form of capitulation.  Oligarch is the right term. Not only because it is the most accurate, but because it is both pejorative and indefensible. The GOP cannot ""own/reclaim"" it as they do with AI images of Trump wearing a crown.",TheCowrus,2025-04-24T18:49:37,1
"You're probably right about that, but I do think she's right about needing another message that's more understandable.",Scarlettail,2025-04-24T17:25:11,1
"Drawing crowds, as we've learned of late, does not really mean much in terms of how popular a candidate is. I suppose I don't have faith voters can actually learn anything because of how widespread apathy is.",Scarlettail,2025-04-24T19:55:33,1
Totally agree.,DocShocker,2025-04-24T17:55:03,1
"Yes, your point?",CrankyVince2,2025-04-24T18:37:53,1
"I can see that.  If they go with kings, they should change oligarchs to Kingmakers",KingThar,2025-04-24T17:28:19,1
The donor class is the problem.,moldivore,2025-04-24T18:39:47,1
"Right, there are many problems. I was responding to a comment that claimed that James Carville is responsible for societies problems because overpaid McKinsey-brained consultants believed his bullshit. In this dichotomy, the consultants are the actual problem. Yes, there are a variety of factors that allow for the consultant class to exist, but even the donor class is just a part of a chain of consequences that ultimately lead back to capital.",CrankyVince2,2025-04-24T19:07:42,1
