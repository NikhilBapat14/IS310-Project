It takes more energy to create hydrogen than to use it. There are some good uses for hydrogen as a fuel but it is not an actual viable energy source.,supremelikeme,2025-04-22T16:20:35,6

"The burning of the Hindenburg in news reels is the burning canvas skin. Some hydrogen burned off but most just escaped. When released, Hydrogen is so light it moves upward at a stupidly fast rate and can diffuse before igniting  It's still, despite everyone's naysaying, the leader in future energy storage and distribution to replace gasoline.   Every detractor focuses on problems that only exist in one kind of fuel source or one kind of utilization method. It has survived all of this, even after being sabotaged by oil companies like Shell, because it is insanely versatile and has fringe benefits no other fuels have such as being a long term chemical battery that does not degrade or lose charge at rest. Most battery cars die within a week or two when not used. We physically cannot make enough solid batteries to meet all our needs, especially not the transportation sector. It is also the only electric vehicle that can refuel in 2 minutes. I can talk for hours about how important it will be for the future of electrical infrastructure. We can turn excess green energy into a near permanently stable fuel, one that can also bridge the rainy day/windless day gap.  Giving the future of energy to just the red states is setting them up to dominate the rest of the country",Bigweld_Ind,2025-04-23T13:40:45,2

"Hydrogen can be stored longer and safer than virtually all liquid fuels. Hydrogen disperses itself quickly, liquids spread out",Bigweld_Ind,2025-04-23T13:33:09,1
"Sure. As long as you can keep it at cryogenic temperatures or extremely high pressures you can store it forever. Good luck at that.   I wouldn’t say it is any safer due to the pressures, temperatures, and explosiveness. Claiming that just shows you don’t know what you are talking about.   Meanwhile, storing gas or diesel is trivially easy at room temperatures and pressures. Hydrogen won’t be replacing liquid fuel anytime soon.",WaterChicken007,2025-04-23T13:50:00,0
"> Good luck at that.  I work in cryogenics. I perform this miracle of yours every single day. It's really not difficult at a technical level. We used vacuum jacketed tanks and pipes. The welds on our pipes are x-rayed to make sure there are zero leaks. We do a 24 hour leak test with thermal cameras to find any flaw  > Claiming that just shows you don’t know what you are talking about  I literally designed safety equipment for the hydrogen fuel industry and wrote an ASTM standard for testing practices. Lmfao. I know exactly what I'm talking about.  > Meanwhile, storing gas or diesel is trivially easy at room temperatures and pressures. Hydrogen won’t be replacing liquid fuel anytime soon.  Well now I know you don't work with either, so lol. There are more safety regulations for liquid fuels, especially petroleum products. Plus a lot of them cause cancer. And destroy the environment from seepage and spills  And before you claim I have a financial incentive for my opinion, I moved to the food industry years ago",Bigweld_Ind,2025-04-23T13:56:22,1
">I work in cryogenics.  Awesome! Maybe you can clear things up for me then. I was under the impression that hydrogen wasn't feasible for use in automobiles because you have to store it in an insulated pressure vessel and that it isn't possible to keep it cold enough to store indefinitely. Again, I could be wrong here, but I thought that it would slowly boil away and would have to be vented. So if you filled up the tank but didn't use your car for a week, the tank could be empty next time you wanted to use it.  Am I misunderstanding things here? Or is hydrogen possible to store long term (months) with zero power input and at safe enough pressures for use in your average passenger vehicle?",WaterChicken007,2025-04-23T14:20:48,1
"Hydrogen fuel cell cars have about 2kg of gaseous hydrogen in a reinforced carbon fiber tank. The tank itself is the strongest part of the car and, in testing, safely vented all its gas and survived in one piece while the rest of the car was a pancake, simulating a fatal accident. Hydrogen is thermodynamically weird because it gets hot when you compress AND expand it, so the fuel is chilled to super low temps before being charged into the car at 700 bar. It goes in cold but does acclimate to room temperature. It doesn't need to be stored cryogenically because it's a gas. That gets them about the same distance as the average gasoline sedan. I have bottles of hydrogen sitting in a shop at room temperature that have not lost any pressure in 3 years. Fuel cell cars should never lose pressure at rest, and they have sensors to detect if there is an unknown loss of fuel.    But cars are not the only or even best use of the fuel. Long term energy storage from excess green energy can be stored virtually indefinitely, and the tanks and fuel cells are far easier to manufacturer and replace than large scale battery farms. It can even be used like a burnable fuel if fuel cells aren't available. It has the potential to solve every problem that green energy sources have with reliable generation, as well as create a new form of power reserve for emergencies. Some experimental cell towers use hydrogen fuel backup generators. The benefits of the fuel make it more efficient, even when considering the extra generation cost in some scenarios.   The only limit on how long Hydrogen can be stored is the rehydro date on the tank (service date), and that can be 10-15 years. That's with zero energy input to maintain it; the tank just sits there. I think you're thinking of liquid nitrogen that cannot be safely contained as a liquid at room temperature without venting to keep the bulk temperature low. Our tanks will lose anywhere from 1-3% of total LIN volume daily from this process, but it can be improved with better insulation and seals ",Bigweld_Ind,2025-04-23T14:44:21,2
"Thanks for the reply and your patience.   I was basing my information off of a YouTube video from Engineering Explained. In it, he was talking about a race car that was using liquid H2 instead of gaseous H2. They were also burning it in a combustion engine, which is fun to think about but not ideal. It was a fun video.
