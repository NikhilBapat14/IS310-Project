"Look, the dude seems like he was a pretty kind, considerate man, who was unusually down to earth for a pope. But that doesn't mean you have to agree with his political positions (and I certainly didn't). You can like a man for who he is but disagree with his beliefs or positions.",jwsk1029,2025-04-21T22:05:57,91
"""Members of Gaza’s small Christian community have said they are “heartbroken” over the death of Pope Francis, who had called them every evening during the war.

"He was holier than I’ll ever be. I respect him as the pontiff. I believe he had dogshit political opinions and I despise, super strongly, the direction in which he has led the Catholic Church. I wish he had never been made pope. If on my day of reckoning Jesus wants to take that up with me, so be it.",Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-04-22T00:08:54,11
"I feel like no-way-about-it, yet, compelled to pick a side. To me, it's more just like, okay, he's gone, I guess there's a process that's got to happen now?",angry_baptist,2025-04-21T23:20:02,-11
"You can’t have peace with people who do not *want* peace, unfortunately, and the majority of Palestinians quite openly do not want peace.",EchoKiloEcho1,2025-04-21T20:57:17,74
"Honest question, not trolling. Was he also an outspoken critic of the October 7th attack and constant bombing of Israel by Hamas? I don't want us involved in the war, but Israel has every right to say ""enough of this BS"" and end it.",Zaphenzo,2025-04-21T20:58:19,48
