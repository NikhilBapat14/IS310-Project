Van Hollen: No really, our country is the richest in the world. We have the strongest army.  We have declared economic war to hurt our enemies and even our own allies.  Bukele:  I have seen that.  Van Hollen:  And yet, our president is afraid of YOU.  Trump pays tribute payments to YOU!  Trump is scared to ask, let alone demand you send Mr. Garcia back to the US.   Bukele:  the money is nice, and you are right.  Mr. Trump has never mentioned that request.  When I visit the states we play golf and just go for massages together.  Only your media asks about this guy.    Van Hollen:  that’s why I am honored to be here in the presence of the greatest world leader in the western hemisphere!
