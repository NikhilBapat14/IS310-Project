Alright so in other words we lost the trade war. You made clear that we have overestimated our value to the global economy and are not a reliable partner.  What did we win?

"Importers last week: paying 245% tariffs on goods they already sold at fixed prices—basically setting money on fire to honor a contract. This week: tariffs drop to 30%. Moral of the story?

"Trump: ""Chaos, uncertainty, and brain dead economic policies all around!""   China: ""I love that for you! Let me help...""  Seriously, China is jonesing to take over as world economic superpower. That's why they've been expanding influence with their ""Belt and Road"" initiative. Now that Trump has cut USAID, there's a huge leadership gap to fill, and they're bound to jump at that chance. All the Canadians we've threatened to invade, all the Europeans we've abandoned in helping Ukraine (and let's consider the very real possibility that we abandon NATO on the whole), they're going to be looking for reliable trading partners. Hopefully they'll work out deals with each other and strengthen ties between democratic nations, but a lot of the gap, I imagine, will be filled by China.  Trump can limit some of the damage by decreasing tariffs, but I think a lot of the damage done is long-term at this point.",bluuuuurn,2025-04-23T01:05:10,6
