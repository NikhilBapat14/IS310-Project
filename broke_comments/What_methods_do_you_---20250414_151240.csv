I'm not sure this is something that needs major changes. If you vote for that party presumably you trust their leadership to negotiate to advance their positions as much as possible. Usually people roughly know which parties their chosen party would enter a coalition with ahead of time as well.  Yes the negotiation process can be opaque but I think there's a danger with trying to give the average voter a ton of influence as well. Until you know how many seats each party gets it's very difficult to know how much leverage a party will have. Similarly it's difficult to know what positions are or are not possible ahead of the actual negotiations. When you vote for a party you are putting your trust in that party's leaders and if you fundamentally don't trust the party then I don't think you should vote for them especially in a multi party system.,socialistrob,2025-04-14T16:53:42,9

"The parties could decide the coalition partners they would enter into the election with before voting took place. You would have to have pretty broad coalition obviously, as there would need to be a plausible chance of that coalition getting overall majority support, so you would end up with only a few coalitions going head-to-head.  Voters could then vote inside that coalition to determine the relative power of parties in the coalition. Then, once everyone knew the relative ideologies and their strengths, and the leadership of each coalition, there would be a second-round of voting where voters decided which of the resulting predetermined coalitions they thought should be in power.  This would be the most transparent method. Voters in the second round would know exactly who they were voting for, which parties they were putting in power and which person would be head of government in the end. It puts the power over the successful coalition directly in the hands of voters instead of complex negotiations behind the scenes that please no one. The two rounds of voting give flexibility to coalition structure. You can vote for your favourite party in the first round and then vote for the least bad coalition in the second round, so you've made sure your voice was heard but you still get to vote against the worst outcome if you don't get exactly what you want in the coalition formation.",just_helping,2025-04-14T19:53:54,2
"Having a system that defaults to being more democratic in the absence of checks and balances may not be a positive.  For example, would you really want the AfD to be in the ruling coalition in Germany just because it came in second place?  Was it a plus that Hitler became chancellor because he was selected after his party won the plurality in the parliament?  Democracy in and of itself is not always virtuous.  The ends may call for different means.  Allowing extremists to pilot the ship is almost always a bad thing.  That shouldn't be surprising, as they are extremists.",I405CA,2025-04-14T22:19:59,1
"Any 40% of the parliament or congress can dismiss the executive branch (President, VP, etc) at any time.   The executive branch has to be acceptable to >60% of elected officials or they aren’t the executive branch anymore.",CosmicQuantum42,2025-04-14T23:25:34,1
"I do think it is important to start by saying that coalition governments are in themselves good for democracy, since they encourage leaders to form broad consensus instead of only catering to their own voters.   I think the issue is actually mostly emotional - voters may be upset to see their leaders compromise in coalitions, even if it leads to better representation of the entirety of the electorate. I think it helps when coalitions don't try to hide their different stances, and speak openly about wins and losses in their internal negotiations.",Lower_Set7084,2025-04-15T10:06:02,1
"the system is such, in theory, that if the party doesnt represent you it doesnt get your vote next time. its a few years wait tho.",youcantexterminateme,2025-04-16T02:24:03,1
"None. Outside of wartime, Coalition governments are a mess, with no vision for the country. It's simply a bunch of politicians attempting to 'win the peace' for their own side.   If the country votes in a minority government, that is actually a democratic outcome that political parties should respect.  nb: Germany is a special case, their system was designed to force coalitions that can make very little in the way of change for what should be obvious reasons.",epsilona01,2025-04-14T19:39:52,0
Abolish all political parties and people vote on the merits of each candidate and arent tied to money from different politcal parties.,Lanracie,2025-04-14T15:18:35,-8

To us this if fantasy. So of course our brains will automatically take some creative liberties!  (Seriously though I’d love to even have European style representation in government as it stands!),Ana_Na_Moose,2025-04-14T19:16:36,1
"What do you think I said that would mean the AfD would have this ability?   The majority in the legislature would have the ability to prohibit a person, from any party, from becoming a member of the executive. Unless the AfD managed to get confidence for a nominee from a majority, they would not have executive power.   Hitler did get to be chancellor but that was because the president appointed him as such. The president of Germany at the time had the power to appoint anyone without the consent of parliament as chancellor or a minister. The legislature did have the power to vote no confidence but the president had the power to dissolve the parliament with nearly no limits to that power, and has misused the combination of the appointment, dissolution, and emergency powers in Article 48 that did not require active consent to use in order to support cabinets without parliament agreeing to any of it and was able to intimidate them into compliance years before Hitler was anywhere near the chancellorship with Brüning and Franz von Pappen.",Awesomeuser90,2025-04-15T06:26:05,1
"How is this intended to be commentary on the concept here?   If there are two parties which are fairly close in size, and together they make up a majority of the seats in the legislature but neither have a majority alone, this kind of system is meant to give them both the chance to balance power during the term of the legislature. They would both be in coalition during the remaining term of parliament and both have ministers, and while one party's leader is the prime minister, the leader of the other big party in the coalition would get to have the deputy prime ministership.",Awesomeuser90,2025-04-16T04:14:50,1
"This is a really surprising take to read as someone from a country that has basically only had coalition governments for 100 years.    Groups of parties can band together to present a united vision. The alternative is just having multiple wings within a party, which ends up being pretty similar except voters don't get to decide the relative power of the various wings.",Lower_Set7084,2025-04-15T11:08:24,1
You can't stop politicians from forming voluntary associations to coordinate. Which is how the parties formed to begin with. They aren't part of government,MaineHippo83,2025-04-14T15:26:57,10
"How? People have the freedom of association, and given the large number of people to judge in any election, people simplify with political parties. And as problematic as parties can be, it can be useful for people who don't have much money if they can focus on a smaller group first. AOC managed to take a seat from the Democratic House Chairman. How likely would that be if all seats were not partisan to begin with?",Awesomeuser90,2025-04-14T15:34:15,5
The “merits” of each candidate in a system without parties will come down to who has the most charisma and dark money backing. Trump almost entirely disproved the notion that people will elect candidates on their merit when given two starkly different choices.,GoldenInfrared,2025-04-14T16:21:27,7
I agree. But Im not sure its possible with the current system. Its almost like the US needs to find an orderly way to breakup and then rejoin with some slightly changed laws. Really if Canada was to join the US it would be a good thing. If they all agreed to a common constitution it would be silly not to.,youcantexterminateme,2025-04-16T02:15:41,3
"If you prioritize democracy for the sake of it, then the leading parties should be in the coalition because they are the leading parties.  The Germans have just formed a coalition without the second place party.  That sounds awfully undemocratic.  And I applaud them for doing it.",I405CA,2025-04-15T08:17:38,1
Yes true. I just meant if they mess it up you get to vote them out next time which hopefully is an incentive for them to do a good job ,youcantexterminateme,2025-04-16T04:25:25,1
"The question is ""what methods do you like"" and gave no methods.  I provided a method.  That it would require a law is of no consequence because any methods would require a law change.",Lanracie,2025-04-14T17:32:46,0
"It was a question on methods.  Pass a law and then you will create a method. I agree there are rules about this, but the question did not specify that laws cannot be changed.  AOC did beat the party as did Trump in 2016, arguable Obama in 2008 it does happen.  But the party puts Mitch McConnel and Nancy Pelosi and tons of other terrible people in power.  the exceptions are very small compared to the evil in my opinion.",Lanracie,2025-04-14T17:28:25,-1
Kamala had way more money as did Hillary and both lost.  Political parties are dark money as well. Charisma always plays a part.  Clinton and Obama and Trump were not the best qualified candidates they were the best at communicating their ideas.,Lanracie,2025-04-14T16:24:29,-1
"How is it a democratic feature to make the second biggest party automatically part of the government? In a place like the Netherlands that would mean a party with 17% of the seats having this right. If a majority of voters support parties which can form a coalition, even if none of them are special in the ranking order of parties and potentially not even having the most voted for party among them, then why does the majority right here become anti democratic in any way?",Awesomeuser90,2025-04-15T08:29:49,1
80% of people voted for other parties directly promising not to work with AfD - what would be democratic about arbitrarily deciding the 20% are particularly important because they choose to group under one name instead of several?,Lower_Set7084,2025-04-15T10:17:04,1
What do you think it means to vote out a prime minister? That is done by a legislature and not by a direct vote. It is hard to create a system that can force a prime minister to leave if there is any way that there can be enough support via other parties to have a workable majority of the legislature's seats.,Awesomeuser90,2025-04-16T04:39:55,1

The strictly democratic view would call for the second place party to have a lot of seats at the table because it came in second place.  Democracy isn't always virtuous.  Majoritarianism is not the only principle that matters.,I405CA,2025-04-15T10:24:15,1

I want them to coordinate on bills. I want them to do it with out a political party telling them how to vote.  Very different.  Have you noticed dems vote in lock step 100% of the time and republcians 95% of the time?  Why is that?,Lanracie,2025-04-14T19:09:04,1

"I really don't think it would - imagine AfD was instead a coalition of 4 smaller parties, holding similar views - they'd be in the same position for all intents and purposes, except that they couldn't claim the mantle of ""second largest"" because they had chosen smaller units of organisation.   I just don't see why that should change their status?   If you just mean ""they got 20% of the vote, they should have a seat at the table"", then sure i guess the democratic ideal is everyone should be at the table - but I don't see why a coalition of 20% should have less democratic power than a single party of 20%",Lower_Set7084,2025-04-15T10:47:44,1
"You are missing my point, how do you prevent them from forming again? Even if unofficially? You plan to ban association in a group?  That would take a constitutional amendment since we have the right to free association in the US",MaineHippo83,2025-04-15T03:13:52,1
"Yes it would take an amendment, you make pollitical parties illegal by exemption or maybe just make it illegal for them to have funds. I am not a lawyer.    Or just a declare a crisis and forget the first amendment exists again like in Covid. I will bring up the 1965 civil rights act says communists dont have civil rights by exemption. That is certainly not constitutional.  The point is what would you change to prevent coallition governments for being awful and that would be to get rid of official coallitions and force people to exist on merit.",Lanracie,2025-04-15T08:15:11,1
"1. i don't want to get sidetracked on covid but things like banning right to assemble in churches was ruled unconstitutional  2. I think you mean the 1964 Civil Rights act, but there is nothing about communists in it. The 1959 Civil Rights act does have a provision banning communists from certain sensitive positions in government.
