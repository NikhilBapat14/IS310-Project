20% doesn't seem like that much considering all the bad press they've been getting.     ,Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-22T15:39:07,70
I’m guessing they’re cooking the books.,mole_that_got_whackd,2025-04-22T15:44:29,24
Let the stock hit the floor baby. ,Electrical_Room5091,2025-04-22T15:35:29,31
Cybertrucks are dangerous and shouldn’t even be allowed on the roads. The other day I drove by *two* of them in the same intersection and I almost crashed because I only have two middle fingers (Jesus take the wheel!).,Casual_hex_,2025-04-22T15:48:44,31
"Elon, a wise man recently told me that sometimes we have to go through some short-term pain for long term gains. You'll be ok.   Worst case, you can get a great job in one of the factories we're bringing back to the States!",BurnedWitch88,2025-04-22T15:46:21,11
A 20% drop?   Those are rookie numbers.  We gotta pump those numbers higher.,arinxe3000,2025-04-22T15:37:43,18

It will get worse. Racists love their oil guzzlers and pro-environment people don’t like racists.,NapOwl,2025-04-22T15:50:29,5
"And yet the stock is up after hours. If this was NVDA, and it had a report like this, the stock would be down 25% by now.  Not that there's any market manipulation going on anywhere. Think Elon has his baby mamas in shell companies buying to keep the price from tanking?",NoOneStranger_227,2025-04-22T15:55:28,2
That's it?,Zeta411North,2025-04-22T15:56:18,2
And yet the stock is up 4% and another 4% over that in after market trading,itsa_luigi_time_,2025-04-22T16:43:43,2
"Good, let it drop further.",ChaseThoseDreams,2025-04-22T17:17:45,2
Gee what could have caused people to protest Tesla.   It is a mystery. ,Existing-Ad4303,2025-04-22T15:39:45,3
How could anyone NAZI this coming?,Modz_B_Trippin,2025-04-22T15:48:20,2
And let me guess… the bad news is making the stock go up? I’m not even going to look I just know this meme stock lacks all reason and logic.,NoCoffee6754,2025-04-22T16:59:43,1
They're coming in even lower than Wall Street estimates,Searchlights,2025-04-22T17:00:16,1
"Elon is kinda making himself into the Jared of Tesla, isn't he?",Stellar_Stein,2025-04-22T17:08:17,1
Howard Lutnick says it’s a great company to buy stock in,doublelist87,2025-04-22T22:27:53,1
"So, imagine a CEO of a company. Your main customers are libs (because they believe electric is the future and climate change and stuff), you utterly alienate your main customer base. Instead of trying to build your company, you lose focus and instead decimate public service jobs (because why?) You align with a president who destroys your entire foreign market with ridiculous tariffs and then doubles down on the country they builds most of your fucking cars. And the shareholders are cool with this…",Saidhain,2025-04-23T01:12:01,1
Maybe the way they recognize revenue is the issue because by the time the boycott starts there might be a lot queued up pending delivery.  So expect that to get worse as the queue is being fulfilled.,thieh,2025-04-22T15:41:30,54
"Keep in mind the boycott stuff started mid-February. Q1 results go through March, so this could be showing a rather big impact over six weeks.",PeterVenkmanIII,2025-04-22T15:47:52,21
"it's from jan1 to march31. Problems didn't start till jan 20, and things got progressively worse from there.   So like, 20% is quite a bit for half a quarter",Threeseriesforthewin,2025-04-22T15:53:41,12
"If it makes you feel any better, its net profit dropped 71% lol",ardent_wolf,2025-04-22T17:34:02,3
20% drop year over year. But the backlash didn't really start until this year. And looking at the quarterly numbers it's very noticeable.,PatternrettaP,2025-04-22T16:50:31,2
"Except it's up for the day, nothing suspicious at all there",Unusually_adequate,2025-04-22T15:57:56,16
"It's absolutely skyrocketing in Afterhours, after gains today.  Went up $10 during the day, knowing that the quarterly was dropping today and it'd be bad.  And after missing every metric, it's up $12 in AA.  The market is just another Vegas at this point, and the house is gonna win.",Newspeak_Linguist,2025-04-22T17:27:16,5
"Is already pretty significant. cause it is Q1, and the Jan was largely unaffected.",nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-04-22T16:01:58,4
"Soros, George Soros, he's paying 1 million to everyone who doesn't buy Tesla... that's the explanation.",belisario262,2025-04-22T15:41:33,5
"This is my understanding. That we would only see the beginnings of the boycott in this report, but by next quarter we should have a much clearer picture of where things stand.   By all accounts, things ain't great for them right now.",BurnedWitch88,2025-04-22T15:45:02,30
"That doesn't even consider the Tesla purchases that were deferred due to the market decline this month. Compared to fourth quarter 2024, we might see a 40% or more decline in second quarter 2025.  The aftermarket trade might be waiting for the earnings call and forward guidance.",No_Philosopher_1870,2025-04-22T15:53:58,14
"Agree, and also many of the Q1 sale lingered from last year as well, some get deferred due to the holiday.",nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-04-22T16:01:10,3
If they still have a net profit we're not doing our jobs.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-23T07:58:15,2
Didn't the earning's report release after the close of the market?,TheOblongGong,2025-04-22T16:34:26,4
It’s all a meme stock,iStayedAtaHolidayInn,2025-04-22T20:20:16,1
Most people willing to protest against Tesla would appreciate cold drinks and a nice lunch.,No_Philosopher_1870,2025-04-22T15:58:33,2
It's up in the aftermarket too,Unusually_adequate,2025-04-22T16:36:54,8
It was up all day. 4.6% stock jump after reporting crap numbers. WTF is going on here? It is already over valued by at least 10x.,WorldCupWeasel,2025-04-22T17:52:55,7
I dunno. Market can be irrational longer than anyone can be solvent. After hours trading can be a bit wonky because of the low volume.,TheOblongGong,2025-04-22T18:03:37,2
