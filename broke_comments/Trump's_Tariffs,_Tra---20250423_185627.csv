"He doesn't have goals, he has confrontations and vendettas.  A goal requires higher level thought. His administration doesn't do that.",No_Sense_6171,2025-04-23T18:58:28,11
"Those trying to understand the tariffs as economic policy are dangerously naive.  Simply put the tariffs are a means to compel loyalty from every business that will need to petition Trump for relief.  Economists and political pundits can not explain how the tariffs make economic sense - because they don't make economic sense.  They are not designed as economic policy.  The tariffs are designed as a new, super dangerous political tool.  The founders of our country created a President with limited and checked powers.  they specifically put the power of spending and taxation in the hands of the Congress, because they had seen how Kings and Despots used spending and taxes to control their subjects.  British kings used taxation to reward loyalty and punish dissent.  Our revolution was spurred by the King's use of heavy taxation of the Colonies to punish our push for self-governance.  The King's message was clear:  stop protesting and I will stop taxing.  Trump knows he can weaken (and maybe destroy) democracy by spending and taxation in the same way.  He is using access to government funds to bully universities, law firms, and State and Local governments into loyalty pledges.  Healthy democracies rely on an independent legal profession to maintain the rule of law, independent universities to guard objective truth and provide forums for dissent to authority, and independent State and Local governments to counterbalance a powerful Federal government - but the private sector also plays a role to protect democracy.  Independent industry has power.  The tariffs are Trump's way of eroding the independence of the private sector.  Now, one by one, every industry or company will need to pledge loyalty to Trump to get the sanctions relief they need to stay in business.  What will Trump demand as part of these loyalty pledges?  Public shows of support for all his policies.  Contributions to his political efforts.  Promises to police their employees to ensure that they support Trump and that none dare oppose Trump in any way.  Trump did not invent this strategy.  It is the playbook for destroying democracy, for those who get elected and want to ensure that they can never be voted out, those who want to remain 'President for life'.  This is how a democracy becomes a dictatorship.  Trump claims 70 countries have called him 'kissing his ass' and begging to make a deal.  But of course we all know it is not other countries that pay tariffs - it is U.S. importers that pay tariffs - and [here we see three major importers being called to the oval office to kiss Trump's ring](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/trump-host-walmart-ceo-target-home-depot-execs-wh-tariff-meeting-rcna202212).  When despots are consolidating their power and dismantling our democracy, you have to find out if you will accept the situation you're in. Either let that become the new normal, or do something. And with that risk everything.",Truthisnotallowed,2025-04-23T19:05:48,7

"""Beyond the inherent contradictions that underlie the ever-shifting rationales for Trump’s tariff policies—negotiated truces will lower tariffs, which will lower tariff revenues and undercut any reshoring of manufacturing, while permanent high tariffs make negotiations pointless.""  Something like this needs to be a standard boiler plate paragraph at the end of every article that talks about trump's tariffs.",yrotsihfoedisgnorw,2025-04-23T19:31:11,1
