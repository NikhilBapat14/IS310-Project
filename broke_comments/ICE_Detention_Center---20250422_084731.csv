"So much sickening stuff in this article. I'll just highlight one part of it:  >[His fiancee previously told *Newsweek*](https://www.newsweek.com/father-chained-humiliated-ice-immigration-2061084) that ICE agents filmed and mocked Gomez while he was moved across the country.  >""The moment that I got detained and arrested, ICE acted like they just caught America's most wanted fugitive. They were ecstatic about it. And I check in with ICE regularly. So that took me by surprise.  >""On the way to the plane, when they were taking us and putting us in a line, walking us up to the plane, a lady was filming us. And then there were ICE officers who would stop us and take pictures with us and throw a peace sign, like we were some trophy fish that they were hunting or something like that",sachiprecious,2025-04-22T09:52:07,21

If you google it the only thing that comes up is your comment...  Edit: Someone above blocked me so I can no longer comment in this thread. That says a lot about the legitimacy of the quote",-JackTheRipster-,2025-04-22T09:17:48,0
There is no record of him saying that anywhere online...not even unvaried Twitter accounts. The quote appears to have been made up by someone.,Extension_Use3118,2025-04-22T09:53:27,0
"You can watch a video of Musks kid shouting ""they'll never know"" a few times during a musk/tucker carlson election night interview after carlson asked the kid if he thinks trump will win. This comes agter the kid said that ""we can quietly do whatever we want at space x.""  Same kid who was telling trump thay he wasnt president to his face. That kid has heard things.   Musk has said on stage that the election would be easy to hack, and was quoted in another instance saying it would only take one line of code.  At the very least its pretty sus. Knowing trump and musk, it seems pretty fucking likely.",[deleted],2025-04-22T10:13:54,5
Funny because I just googled it and the statement is still on Twitter. There's tons of evidence and public statements to suggest this election was stolen. I live in a deep red town and I only heard of people moving away from Trump this year. The voting data is also pretty much an impossibility unless it was manipulated. Doesn't show natural patterns.,Historical_Usual5828,2025-04-22T09:29:35,3

"The problem is that op is the only source for the quote. His comment is literally the only place online where the quote appears.   I'm not going to debate election conspiracy theories, I just want to point out that the quote is misinformation.",TheManQueef,2025-04-22T10:19:32,3

"JFC this is concerning   https://x.com/HewittNewton/status/1855309730794881313  I don't use Twitter and I really wanted to avoid posting a Twitter link or visiting the site myself but I remember Elon saying something like this on video at a rally before the election. He definitely said something about changing ""just one line of code"" on the voting machines.   Then there's this  https://youtu.be/F9gCyRkpPe8?si=SY6lgmumQfuLIVZ_   I can see there's been efforts to scrub data of them blatantly admitting to rigging the election. Hard to find the full video from that 2nd link anymore.   Election truth alliance has done some analysis and here's some of the findings so far.   https://electiontruthalliance.org/2024-us-election-analysis",Historical_Usual5828,2025-04-22T13:44:15,-1
I looked everywhere & there is no record of the quote...outside of this comment. It's misinformation. Likely someone having a laugh.,TheManQueef,2025-04-22T10:23:13,1

"The quote makes no mention of any election or voting. Going farther down the rabbit hole, if you search for the quote used in that tweet:  >You can just change one line of code.""  You won't find anything. The only source is the tweet & a removed reddit post.",-JackTheRipster-,2025-04-22T10:08:58,0
you're playing semantics. He's specifically referring to hacking computers with the intent of rigging an election.,different_tom,2025-04-22T13:47:13,0
"How would you know?  The quote found in that tweet is also nowhere to be found anywhere on the internet other than that tweet. So it's the second quote that no one can find a source for in the thread.   Did you read this entire thread starting with the made up quote? The ""semantics""  card doesn't work here.",Extension_Use3118,2025-04-22T16:37:45,1
It absolutely works here. You're claiming he wasn't talking about elections because he didn't use the same words as in the quote when it was clear via context. You're arguing the meaning of his words.,different_tom,2025-04-22T17:23:01,-1
How could you possibly know the context of something there is no record of him even saying? The person who used the quote in a tweet went on to talk about the election. Is that's what's throwing you off?    I'm not trying to make you feel bad but that's just not what semantics are.,Extension_Use3118,2025-04-22T18:26:56,1
"Ok, you clearly didn't watch the clip online.  https://youtu.be/cV58O0USCaY?si=wH008P3COAyxxnoZ",different_tom,2025-04-22T19:15:40,0
"Were you hoping I wouldn't watch it? Because I did. He never said the quote used in the tweet. So I'll ask again, how can you know the context of something there is no record of him saying?",Extension_Use3118,2025-04-22T19:28:42,1
"Ok, this is the semantics I mentioned earlier. He didn't use that exact quote, but this is clearly where he talks about 'one line of code' in the context of rigging elections.  The similarity between what he said in the video and the mis-quote suggests this is where the mis-quote came from. Simply because the words aren't exact doesn't mean what was said was any different",different_tom,2025-04-22T19:35:32,0
"Again, that's not what semantics means, but okay.    The fake quote is based on something he said while campaigning for paper ballots. Literally the opposite of what the fake quote was going for.   Yes or no, do you actually believe he might have hacked the election to make Trump win?",Extension_Use3118,2025-04-22T19:52:07,1
"Holy shitballs, you're arguing the meaning of words. That's what semantics is.  What I'm saying is he's expressing the same thing in the video as the fake quote is expressing, regardless of his exact wording.  He expressed that he'd prefer paper ballots because it's too easy to hack voting machines. You just need ""one line of code"".  See, his discussion of paper ballots is the 'context' I was referring to earlier.  It frames his following sentences to refer to election tampering.  So when he says 'you just need one line of code', he's communicating that you just need one line of code to tamper with election results. Which is precisely what the fake quote is also trying to express.  This is where I claim your argument is 'semantic'.  Because you're arguing that the meaning behind his words are different from the fake quote, even though they communicate the same thing.",different_tom,2025-04-22T20:08:13,0
We were arguing whether or not he said something. You seem to admit he didn't...finally. That's not anyone's definition of semantics. I hate to tell you...,Extension_Use3118,2025-04-22T20:28:56,1
"Does any conservative argue in good faith?  Fucking hell, you certainly don't know what semantics means, that for certain. Not sure where the ""finally"" comes from either considering I've been calling it a fake quote.  The point in trying to make is that he expressed the same thing the game quote expresses.  Which makes he's effectively said the same thing.",different_tom,2025-04-22T21:18:44,1
 I'm a conservative because I pointed out misinformation? Surprising take. Anyways have a good night.,Extension_Use3118,2025-04-22T21:28:05,1
