"It will take a sustained period of real pain. The majority of us haven't felt any pain yet. There are pockets of individuals like Stellantis employees, federal government employees, etc. that have felt pain, but for most of us it is still somewhat theoretical. We're told tariffs will raise prices but we haven't really seen it yet. We need to actually experience increased prices, mass layoffs, etc. for like at least 6 months.  Trump's second term so far has been a clown show and his voters are still high-fiving each other.  they'll buy into the ""we need to live through some pain before we come out stronger on the other side"" bullshit - until they personally get laid off, burn their emergency funds, have their pickup truck repossessed, lose their homes, etc.",che-che-chester,2025-04-04T19:53:08,41

"We have two different realities in America right now, depending on who you get your news from.  My MAGA family still thinks God is guiding Trump in all of his decisions, so to question Trump is to question God.  They still think everything Trump does is part of God's grand master plan that man is not capable of comprehending.  God kicked Adam & Eve out of the Garden of Eden for eating from the 'Forbidden Tree of Knowledge'.  So basically, God wants you to remain stupid and not ask questions. yada, yada, yada  Those who live in the real world can see the damage Trump and Republicans are doing, but feel powerless to stop it.  The stock market can still fall more because we're just starting to see the damage being done.  In a few months, when we get 2nd quarter results, we'll see a clearer picture of the carnage.  So is America souring on MAGA?  It depends on who your news source is and which religious leaders you follow (if any).

They all are convinced this is temporary pain and argued with me that the longer these tariffs are in place, the better the outcome will be lol. Then again perhaps I shouldn't be surprised.

"If the Dark Enlightenment ideology is enacted under Donald Trump’s administration, many of his supporters may have mixed reactions from initial support to eventual disillusionment. This movement, championed by figures like Curtis Yarvin and funded by tech billionaires such as Peter Thiel and Elon Musk, seeks to dismantle democracy and replace it with a corporate-style authoritarian system. They envision governance by a ""CEO-king"" or dictator, where citizens are treated as shareholders in a hyper-capitalist, hierarchical state. While some Trump supporters may initially embrace this shift due to their loyalty to Trump or their distrust of current democratic institutions, they might later realize how this system concentrates power among elites and strips away individual rights.  Trump’s recent actions align closely with this ideology. His administration has worked to weaken democratic norms, consolidate executive power, and undermine federal institutions. Vice President J.D. Vance, influenced by Yarvin’s ideas, has been instrumental in shaping policies that reflect these neo-reactionary principles. Trump has also questioned the legitimacy of elections, creating a narrative that could justify eliminating them altogether. Meanwhile, Elon Musk’s financial backing and influence over lawmakers further amplify this agenda. Musk has reportedly threatened to fund challengers against politicians who oppose Trump’s initiatives, ensuring compliance with this authoritarian framework.  Globally, the U.S. faces mounting challenges that may accelerate the implementation of such a system. The stock market crash is not solely tied to Trump but reflects broader issues like the U.S.’s unsustainable debt-to-GDP ratio (currently at 124%) and its waning global influence. The BRICS nations now account for over 60% of the world’s population, challenging U.S. economic dominance. Jeffrey Sachs has openly urged Europe to abandon the U.S., dissolve NATO, and align with Russia and China for long-term stability. These developments suggest that the U.S. is entering damage control mode, potentially using the Dark Enlightenment as a framework to maintain internal control while facing external decline.  The revelations about U.S. foreign policy, such as war crimes in Vietnam, Iraq, Libya, Yemen and Syria, and the Nord pipeline bombing have further eroded global trust in American leadership. With the empire overextended and the systems under strain, the government appears poised to implement an authoritarian model that prioritizes elite interests over public welfare. If enacted, many Trump supporters may eventually realize that this system does not serve them but instead entrenches power among a small group of technocrats and oligarchs while leaving ordinary citizens powerless.",radio-act1v,2025-04-05T01:18:33,1

To quote u/I405CA:  “Empirical work exists showing that most people support a party because they believe it contains people similar to them, not because they have gauged that its policy positions are closest to their own.

Most people choose the party that appears to have “people like me.”  To break Trump’s support, efforts need to made so that the club members want to turn on Trump, on their terms.  They need to stop seeing him as being people like me.  Many Trump voters see him as a patriotic and tough winner.  They need to come to see him as an unpatriotic and weak loser, as they define it.  Democrats tend to focus on what they perceive to be his meanness.  But many of his fans see that as a positive quality or they perceive it as a show of strength, so that approach ultimately backfires.  Trump opponents need to attack him with terms such as “incompetent”, “weak” and “failed”.  They need to mock him for being a screwup rather than making him appear to be tough by fearing him.  The threat to democracy argument does not move marginally attached Democrats.  Devoted Trump supporters believe that there is a threat to democracy, but that it’s the Democrats who pose the threat.

"Honestly, I don’t think a lot of these folks will feel the impact right away. Urban areas that rely more on imports for essentials will get hit first. Rural communities tend to feel the effects a bit later, but small business owners will probably notice it early on—storefronts closing, neighbors wondering why basic goods are suddenly more expensive or just simply not gone off the shelf from their local Walmart or Target.  The tariffs are a big factor. A 10% blanket tariff on imports (with even higher rates for specific countries) could end up costing the average American household around $3,800 a year. That hits everyday items—clothes, food, cars—the hardest, especially for lower-income families.  Then there’s the health angle. Older folks who rely on medication could be among the first to really feel it. Cuts to Medicaid are already on the table, and some of Trump’s policy reversals have rolled back efforts to reduce drug prices. If you’re on a fixed income like Social Security (which they already are working on removing) and need daily meds, that’s not a slow burn—that’s an immediate problem.

"I'm all for a secure border. I agree more with Trump's strict border policy than Biden's less secure border policy of giving everyone asylum.   BUT TRADE DEALS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH BORDER SECURITY. The thing Trump supporters fail to understand with trade deficits is that all a trade deficit measures is how much we buy from another country vs how much they buy from us. There are some countries we just buy more from because they produce a very niche product and sell us a lot of it because we have 350 million people and our people have a bunch of disposable income and they don't have a big population or a big economy so they don't buy much from us, or anyone for that matter because their country is poor and small and their economy just doesn't consume much products from other countries   Take Madagascar for example which now has a 47% tariff on their goods. Madagascar produces around 80% of the world's supply of vanilla. They have the climate for it and they have set up a large network of plantations that can grow it. The US cannot grow vanilla due to not having a tropical climate and its lack of vanilla plantations. Because Americans like vanilla ice cream, vanilla lattes, vanilla protein powder, etc. they import a shit ton of vanilla from Madagascar. Because Madagascar is a poor country with much less population than the US, they don't import as much from the USA. So, now we have just made a product that we can't get really from anywhere else, 47% more expensive because of an arbitrary ""trade deficit number""   In a way, I have a 100% trade deficit with the grocery store because they have food and I give them money for food but I don't give them any of my goods or labor in return. It's a meaningless number. Just because we buy more from a country than they buy from us doesn't mean they are fucking us over. The US is a massive market and will carry a ""trade deficit"" with most countries.  This is why Trump imposed tariffs, not the border. This is the entire premise of his tariff policy.

"While I agree, that he's using the tariffs to create leverage in negotiation of trade deals, it still puts massive uncertainty in the markets. Markets fucking hate uncertainty and they aren't likely to have a big bull run until they know the economy is relatively stable, which doesn't happen when world trade and global supply chains are being upended. I will probably begin DCA'ing a little more cash throughout this dip over the year and put more in than I normally would but that's all for long term investment. I don't see the S&P touching all time highs again until after the midterms in 2026 when the Republicans lose the house and the market begins pricing in more stability for a post MAGA economy.  These countries also makes other country's way less inclined to do business with the US because they see there is instability in pricing.   What the Trumpsters fail to understand about trade deficits is that they are all arbitrary. All a trade deficit measures is how much we spend importing a country's products vs how much they spend importing ours.   Take Madagascar for example which now has a 47% tariff on their goods. Madagascar produces around 80% of the world's supply of vanilla. They have the climate for it and they have set up a large network of plantations that can grow it.

I'm all for the US to start moving away from importing everything from China, especially in strategic sectors like pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, industrial equipment, etc. I want to see those high skilled manufacturing industries have some footprint in the US but I also want to see the US diversify in who they import stuff from.  Another thing Trunpsters fail to realize is that manufacturing stuff in the US is expensive.

He won because he convinced enough people that aren’t obsessed with politics to vote for him. Those are the people that don’t have political allegiances. They vote based on how things are and who they see as the answer to their problems. A lot of them voted for Trump in 2024 because they saw him as better on the economy. A lot of them are likely regretting their vote.,BigfootTundra,2025-04-05T18:24:34,2
