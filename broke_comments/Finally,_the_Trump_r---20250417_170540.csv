We need to stand with Harvard and the Supreme Court to show Trump that these attacks will not be tolerated.,Cool_Net_3796,2025-04-17T18:10:11,118
"This is good news, and there's still more good news of growing resistance, now from collegiate athletic conferences with members agreeing to pool their resources in mutual defense similar to NATO to resist Trump's attacks on any of their members.",Winter-Gift1112,2025-04-17T18:05:57,62
"I think Harvard have enough rich kids there that made them able to shrug that 2 billion funding threat. However, i am also not against fund raising if it comes to that.  Show them that a scholar's worth is nothing without their integrity and tolerance, the value that Harvard is espousing by standing firm against the pressure.",razler_zero,2025-04-17T19:24:22,42
I hope more colleges stand with Harvard because what Trump is doing is sickening. He has no right to force them to teach or hire how he wants. Its great to see Harvard is fighting that miserable lawless twice impeached convicted felon.,Torracattos,2025-04-17T22:23:52,27

"Agreed. In the article, Reich says that he thinks that the Cheetoad is ""smart enough"" not to push it right now with these three big battles right now and that he'll find a way to back things down with them, but he'll make it ""look"" like he won. I'm not sure if he's ""smart"" enough for that or not. Right now his arrogance seems to have really taken over his whole entire being, and he just seems drunk on it.",Puzzleheaded_Two6805,2025-04-18T06:31:43,9
It does look like more are standing up against them too.  https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/16/trump-universities-response  Forbes has also identified 39 that have the outside funding to be able to stand up as well  https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawhitford/2025/04/16/39-trump-proof-universities/,primax1uk,2025-04-18T03:34:04,5
