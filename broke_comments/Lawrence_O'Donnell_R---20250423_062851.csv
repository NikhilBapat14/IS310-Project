"The Wall Street Journal fired off an editorial calling Trump’s tariffs “the biggest economic policy mistake in decades,” and said Trump’s policies followed by his threat against Powell triggered a financial “meltdown.”  So on Tuesday, Trump did some damage control.  “I have no intention of firing him,” Trump said while taking questions from reporters during a televised appearance where he also blamed the media.  O’Donnell said Trump capitulated in front of everyone.  “And so now the humiliated clown Donald Trump, who has been the subject of some of the finest economic editorial writing the Wall Street Journal has ever done, has decided that it’s time to back down and desperately assure Wall Street ‘I have no intention of firing him,’” O’Donnell summarized.",FreddieJasonizz,2025-04-23T07:07:49,1296

"He always was. Everyone knew that there were only two possible outcomes: either the USA commits economic suicide, or the USA government folds. Either way, Trump loses.  All those countries wanting to ""negotiate""? They were just there to gain time or to see whether they could deflect the tariffs by promising something of no consequence. The EU even offered something they always wanted in the hope that Trump's ego would compel him to accept that as a ""win"". China, having more to gain domestically by forcing the USA into an unwinnable position, chose confrontation instead. Almost everyone else would have too, eventually.

That’s not a power Trump has, but the threat spooked investors already skittish over Trump’s tariffs and caused the Dow to plunge yet again on Monday.  > The Wall Street Journal fired off an editorial calling Trump’s tariffs “the biggest economic policy mistake in decades,” and said Trump’s policies followed by his threat against Powell triggered a financial “meltdown.”  > So on Tuesday, Trump did some damage control.  > “I have no intention of firing him,” Trump said while taking questions from reporters during a televised appearance where he also blamed the media.  > O’Donnell said Trump capitulated in front of everyone.  > “And so now the humiliated clown Donald Trump, who has been the subject of some of the finest economic editorial writing the Wall Street Journal has ever done, has decided that it’s time to back down and desperately assure Wall Street ‘I have no intention of firing him,’” O’Donnell summarized.",yellowstickypad,2025-04-23T09:42:29,3

Either out of spite or to make gains from market manipulations.  A believable mistake might be something like a 5%-10% tariff on products and resources which can be reasonably produced in US, no tariff on resources required to start manufacturing. That would be putting pressure on consumers, probably reducing consumption on luxury goods.

"Set aside the tariffs for a second. The broader point is actually somewhat untrue.   There has been a remarkable resurgence in manufacturing the United States since 2010.  However, it's gone mostly unnoticed by the larger public for exactly the reason you mentioned.  The steel plant in Pennsylvania that closed in 1985 employed 4,000 people and 90% of them were blue collar workers.    It was a union facility.   The steel plant opening today is in Arkansas or Louisiana or kentucky or mississippi.  It produces the same amount of Steel as that old plant in the 80s if not more, but it employs 250 people, and fully half of them are Engineers or IT workers who run the robots who make the steel. The blue collar workers are forklift drivers and truck drivers and maintenance technicians.  They make okay money, usually $20 an hour or more, but significantly less than those workers in 1985 made adjusted for inflation. Hell, some of the steel workers in the 1980s made close to $20 an hour, the average wage of a union steel worker in 1990 was $13.83 an hour.  These new plants are in right to work states.   Of course, tariffs don't make any of this better.

"There's another reason and it has to do with US vs the world tariffs.   If you (as a company) have the resources to build a factory, would you choose to:  *Build it in the US** and  1. Have your materials subject to import tariffs   2. Gain the ability to sell to the US market tariff free  3. Lose the competitive advantage with the rest of the world as importers will have to pay tariffs to import your products due to reciprocal tariffs.  OR  1. Put your factory in another country that will have:  2.Lower to no import tariffs on your materials  3.Have better relations with other countries and thus allow you to export your product to other countries at a lower or no tariff.  4. Have a consolidated factory in one country allowing better economies of scale.  5. Sell to the US with tariffs.   The importers in the US will raise the price on your oroduct, but the market has shown they can absorb the cost.   OR  Have duplicate factories (friendly overseas country and the US)  1.  Same issues as a US factory above  2.  Lose economy of scale  3.  Your costs have gone up (extra factory) for no other advantage but to avoid import tariffs on the US.  This could maybe make sense for items that are expensive to ship (large home appliances and furniture) but for other things where there are no other savings, you're not getting much for building a new factory, hiring and training new employees, and establishing logistics to get your parts and raw materials at the new location.   ---  If they really wanted to bring production to the US, the best way would be to make it more attractive by making it more efficient to produce certain things in the US based on need and ability.",LordoftheChia,2025-04-23T11:56:23,2

Trump gets impeached and he becomes a political martyr. That comes with most of the benefits of being a conventional martyr with the bonus of not being dead.  This puts Vance in a tough spot, because he seems pretty dependant on the Trump bloc for any political future. He has welded himself to that brand, and would face enormous pressure to simply be Trump’s meat puppet.  Also, as long as we're doing speculative fiction, given that it's then Vance’s neck on the line I wouldn't be shocked if Trump pushed him into doing even more unhinged positions simply so he could say “it’s all JD’s fault, JD did it.

And I firmly believe that evil is easier to combat than stupid.   I often think of this Bonhoeffer quote when I think of them:  >Stupidity is a more dangerous enemy of the good than malice. One may protest against evil; it can be exposed and, if need be, prevented by use of force. Evil always carries within itself the germ of its own subversion in that it leaves behind in human beings at least a sense of unease. Against stupidity we are defenseless. Neither protests nor the use of force accomplish anything here; reasons fall on deaf ears; facts that contradict one’s prejudgment simply need not be believed – in such moments the stupid person even becomes critical – and when facts are irrefutable they are just pushed aside as inconsequential, as incidental. In all this the stupid person, in contrast to the malicious one, is utterly self satisfied and, being easily irritated, becomes dangerous by going on the attack. For that reason, greater caution is called for when dealing with a stupid person than with a malicious one. Never again will we try to persuade the stupid person with reasons, for it is senseless and dangerous.",woahwoahwoah28,2025-04-23T07:41:39,389

"Everything you say is true, but the bullshit artists use “factories” as shorthand for “jobs”, and as you note, that is not true at all. Nobody cares where products are made; some people believe that products made in the US mean greater employment and opportunity.   But to the extent anyone bricks manufacturing to the US, it is only because it can be automated to such a degree that savings in shipping and distribution offset the higher land and labor costs.   Your 250 person steel mill will be a 100 person steel mill within 10 years, and a 10 person steel mill within 20 years. So maybe some manufacturing comes back, but “factories” in the traditional economic sense… they’re not coming back.",rotates-potatoes,2025-04-23T08:15:09,37

"Yes, the problem however is that the majority of sitting politicians have never worked a blue collar job, have never stepped foot in a factory for any reason other than a photo-op where they didn't even bother to pay attention, and have no idea how modern industry works.   Instead they have this notion of 1920's factory jobs that somehow let a man be able to support a family reliably. They think that just by returning those jobs they will bring back those kinds of families; without realizing that the cost of living has skyrocketed since the 60's, and corporate greed has always been actively preventing people from earning a living wage so that people work more. produce more, and accept unreasonable conditions.

You would have to revolutionize how the public views blue collar work. Not the worker but the work itself as important and in disposable.

You can go to a completely amoral company and say “we’ll give you a tax break if you stop doing this shitty thing” and they’ll go “tax break? All we needed to hear, we’ll stop right now!”  With the right structure, raw pragmatic selfishness can be aligned with the interests of society as a whole. This is what makes capitalism function (for a certain degree of function) - what Adam Smith called “Enlightened Self-Interest”.  Evil can be dealt with, defeated, compromised with, co-opted, pacified, and satisfied. It can be directed away from the path of destruction by appealing to it’s own selfishness.  Stupidly is a force of nature. A natural disaster that can’t be negotiated with or convinced to stop even by threat of harm to itself.",BlueDragon101,2025-04-23T11:01:24,5

Among cognitively impaired (CIND and dementia), however, there was significant loss of consistency between an individual’s political orientation and their policy choices. Level of political engagement was high for participants, with more than 90% voting in the most recent presidential election.  Conclusions: In this population of older persons, political identification on the liberal-conservative spectrum was resilient despite cognitive decline, but its meaning and function were changed. For the cognitively impaired it remained a self-defining label, but no longer operated as a higher order framework for orienting specific policy preferences. There appeared to be loss of coherence between the political orientation and political policy choices of cognitively impaired individuals. Given the high level of political engagement of these individuals, these results have substantial public policy implications.",VWBug5000,2025-04-23T10:18:47,27

While this view is optimistic about global growth of renewables, heat pumps and EVs, it also indicates a slower and dirtier path for the U.S. >  > Bond argues that since most countries do not have plentiful oil and gas within their borders, they need to import it and have confidence in the stability of supply and pricing. As that confidence erodes, they will look to alternatives. >  > Most countries do not have substantial solar panel, wind turbine or battery production, so reliance on those resources would also require imports. But the difference compared to fossil fuels is that a shipment of solar panels, for example, can provide benefits for 30 years. The buyer isn’t signing up for dependence on daily shipments of fuel. >  > This isn’t some fanciful theory. China already has a set of renewable energy policies that look a lot like what Bond is describing, as does the European Union. >  > The key theme here is “security.” I’ve been noticing the frequency of that word in energy discussions ever since reading a research note last month from Jeff Currie, chief strategy officer of energy pathways at Carlyle, an investment firm.     https://cleantechnica.com/2025/04/05/china-just-turned-off-u-s-supplies-of-minerals-critical-for-defense-cleantech/   > What China did wasn’t a ban, at least not in name. They called it export licensing. Sounds like something a trade lawyer might actually be excited about. But make no mistake: this was a surgical strike. They didn’t need to say no. They just needed to say “maybe later” to the right set of paperwork. These licenses give Beijing control over not just where these materials go, but how fast they go, in what quantity, and to which politically convenient customers. >  > The U.S.? Let’s just say Washington should get comfortable waiting behind the rope line. The licenses have to be applied for and the end use including country of final destination must be clearly spelled out. Licenses for end uses in the U.S. are unlikely to be approved. What’s astonishing is how predictable this all was. China has spent decades building its dominance over these supply chains, while the U.S. was busy outsourcing, divesting, and cheerfully ignoring every report that said, “Hey, maybe 90% dependence on a single country we keep starting trade wars with and rattling sabers at is a bad idea.” >  > Try ramping up your semiconductor fab or solar plant when your indium source just dried up.

"The perjury happened in an investigative interview with federal agents prior to any trial.  They almost always ask many questions about material facts they know(and can prove) the answer to, so lying about those can be charged as perjuring statements. They do this so suspects aren't able to figure out what they already know or not based on which questions are or aren't asked.  They'll also ask questions about other subjects that are irrelevant to their case, but can give the suspect the impression the agents are clueless about the facts of the case, as well as other trick questions intended to trip you up or set ""perjury traps""(by getting you to admit something that counters a lie they believe you'd tell later).  While lying on the stand is textbook perjury, anytime you make material statements of fact to any officials conducting an investigation of any sort, when you know(or a reasonable person would know) those statements are false, you've committed perjury.    Side note; one's claim of guilt or innocence cannot be used against you as you're not making a material statement of fact, but your belief in whether the facts of a case support a finding of guilty or not guilty.  That's also why lawyers can defend clients they know are guilty, because if you couldn't tell your lawyer the truth they have no chance of successfully defending you.  Their job is to attack the prosecution evidence and convince the jury you're not-guilty by reasonable doubt.  Even if you get off on a technicality and you definitely committed a crime, you're still factually not guilty if the jury determines it.  Martha Stewart definitely committed insider trading and screwed over many shareholders in her company, but her attorney made enough reasonable doubt that the jury didn't believe the case was proven enough to find her guilty.

"Wealth was forcibly taken from one group, and given to another. In the name of a better nation and stronger country.   That’s politicized redistribution of wealth. Ergo. Trump is a communist.   More wealth was transferred away from the richest nation in the world by one person in human history. That’s the epitome of anti capitalism.   Trump is an operative. He lies to the right, and does what anarchists and communists get high and dream of.  The steep decline in trade and global transportation will be a boon for clean air, and less manufacturing waste due to a slowdown.   For people demanding climate action by any means necessary, kneecapping the spending of the world’s most potent consumer market only improves the environment.   Trump says one thing, and then satisfies the wet dreams of the most extreme leftists.   His tariffs will drive people to eat local and shop local. He ripped money away from corporate investors. He drove up the price of fuel - which reduces driving. He’s pushing millions into our social safety nets increasing service demand (demand always equates to funding).  He’s a Nazi piece of shit, but it’s very weird how his rhetoric is in one direction, but the outcomes of his actions are in an entirely different direction.    ",YourAdvertisingPal,2025-04-23T08:47:38,-8
