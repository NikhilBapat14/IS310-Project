"I am autistic, I work as a data lead in healthcare research, both academic and private. My work is in claims research and HEOR work (health equity and healthcare gaps research.) I cannot even begin to tell you how STUPID this approach is. Anyone with even the smallest fucking understanding of how claims data is collected and analyzed will tell you right off the bat this isn't how it's done.  He lists three things:   Pharmacy claims (surely for vaccine reporting because, important to note, nothing is specifically indicated for autism)   Department of Veterans data (probably physician-reported claims)   Indian Health Services Data (also probably physician-reported claims, focused on Native Americans and reserve healthcare)  This is a strange dataset. Pharmacy claims are one small picture of healthcare claims and is tied to the product. When you go to a doctor, a doctor adds ICD-10 codes or CPT-codes in alignment to the visit based on what was RELEVANT to the visit. It is very, very unlikely that every time you go to the doctor, they capture an autism claim. Why would they? There's nothing to reimburse, it's not relevant to a broken arm visit or a flu visit or an allergies visit. This kind of research captures *contextual* healthcare data, not *all* healthcare data, and what's contextual changes constantly by what can be coded for reimbursement or is validated in RVUs.  It is REALLY REALLY unlikely they can even make headway in the false direction they want to go (aka, vaccines and autism).

"86 years ago, Germany established the T-4 program, of identifying German citizens with disabilities in the name of science and research.    Around the same time, Germany was also identifying “other races” which were vilified as murderers, rapists and thieves who were rotting the good people of Germany from the inside out.   To keep the German bloodlines “clean” and prevent future generations from suffering genetic defects, Germany systematically euthanized “impure” people in institutions with disabilities by way of gas chambers and starvation, as well as scientific studies as human lab rats.   The T-4 program was later expanded from the disabled to include other “impure” Germans who were villainized because of race.   They were able to sell all this to the German people by promising that it was a necessity step to protect and enhance the lives of future Germans.    This is almost word for word what the US is doing now. Except that they are already disappearing citizens who are labeled “home growns”.  Sadly, this is not unique to the US.  Canada too has been guilty of this through the establishment of their MAID program.  A program that the US has taken a keen interest in duplicating.  As a person with a genetic disorder, grotesquely deformed, chronically ill, disabled and now an amputee who is wholly dependent on social assistance, I’ve seen a huge slide in society in this direction over the past 40 years… a slide that only worsens as economies falter, as we are often blamed as “dead weight” that societies are increasingly resentful towards. I’ve already had several Doctors discussing the benefits of doctor assisted suicide, and one that went so far as to suggest that I consider “I should be ashamed by how much I owe to the Canadian people”.  (A Canadian pain management specialist with strong “Confucian” beliefs.)  All that to say, we are now rounding a corner. What comes next for the disabled communities is even worsening conditions, conditions that are already appalling. What’s worse still is that we are already ignored completely, isolated and forgotten.. so by the time people even take notice (if they care at all) , this canary will be long gone, and the “home grown” net will start to expand exponentially.",Random-Name-7160,2025-04-24T20:58:06,1

Well out of those 1 in 31, the high need austistic groups, account for .75% of the total US population. And look, I'm fine looking into if there can be an environmental toxin, or something done or not done, like certain vitamins during pregnancy, but that shit takes time, years, not 5 months like RFK says he's gonna do. I was kinda surprised it was only .75%. Because they make it seem when they speak of this ""epidemic,"" it would had been a lot higher than .75%.   Second, I just saw a reel and it made sense. They won't find any cure, or anything to show an austism link, but with people scared about being put on a list, they'll just stop getting diagnosed.
