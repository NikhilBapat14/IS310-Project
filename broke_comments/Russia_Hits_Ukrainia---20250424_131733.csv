"In the deadliest attack on the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv since the summer of 2024, Russia launched a combined missile and drone offensive on Wednesday night, burying Ukrainians under rubble, killing eight people, and injuring more than 70 others.  Vladimir Putin, what are you doing?",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-24T13:58:12,462
This is why the stupid war shouldn't not have started in the first place. And this is why the stupid war has to stop.,AstraVolans_21,2025-04-24T13:26:50,38
But russia has been running out of missiles for 3 years now. How can this be? Did Zelensky lie about Ukraine’s chances in this war?,patrick_bamford_,2025-04-24T13:31:07,-70
"Maybe we should ask Obama if the 1980s are still calling for our foreign policy back?  Seems to me his do-nothing approach (except for some stern words of course) in 2014 lies at the root of where we find ourselves today.    Though, doing nothing is a good bit better than drone bombing US citizens without due process.  But who could possibly be bothered to worry about facts and history in this day and age?",vertigonex,2025-04-24T13:38:45,-66
Ukraine won’t surrender and Russia won’t stop so the best course of action for the USA is to do nothing.,UpvoteMagnet99,2025-04-24T15:08:17,-28

Democrats are rejoicing that Trump isn’t able to broker peace.,shamalonight,2025-04-24T14:01:02,-54
Putin probably wants the war to continue. Time is on his side. The longer it goes on the more territory he takes and the better his position becomes in any negotiations.,KinGpiNdaGreat,2025-04-24T14:04:18,336
"From another perspective, it looks like he's finally making efforts to *finish* the war  In the worst way",Baptism-Of-Fire,2025-04-24T16:13:17,4
"He’s winning the war that’s what he’s doing. Why do you think the US bomb Tokyo? Or the Germans bombed London? I’m not saying it’s a good thing, but that’s what’s happening.",BlackScienceManTyson,2025-04-24T16:30:24,-8
"Okay. Cool. And how do you accomplish that? Trump already tried placating Russia and preemptively giving away leverage the US might have held over them, it predictably went nowhere.   Now what? Ask the Ukrainians to surrender unconditionally because their war has become too inconvenient? Hope that Russia accepts a peace deal in which they get less than what they could take by force on the battlefield?    At the end of the day, this is a difficult situation and I don't even blame Trump too much for not being able to put a quick stop to it - but boy do his repeated, bold claims of ending it ""easily within a few weeks"" look bad.",Black_XistenZ,2025-04-24T14:51:09,447

Honestly half this country didn't care 3 years ago when we totally abandoned Afghanistan to the Taliban. I wouldn't blame the US for pulling 100% out of this shit show at this point.   Let Europe deal with Russia. They're still buying Russian gas ,Opening-Citron2733,2025-04-24T15:34:31,-14
"Yep, it is high time the war ends now and a settlement is negotiated. Ukraine needs to realize they aren’t going to win regardless of how many upvotes they get on reddit, life is unfair and so is this war.",patrick_bamford_,2025-04-24T13:33:43,-182

"> Putin probably wants the war to continue.  He does.  He's a Duganite ultranationalist.  He believes that Ukraine is a literal part of Russia and thus belongs to him, and that Russia cannot survive without controlling it along with several other former Soviet satellites. Now that he knows the US will abandon Ukraine, why wouldn't he ramp up the attacks?",cathbadh,2025-04-24T14:58:01,337

"Time really isn't on his side. He's just about exhausted the soviet-era surplus that the Russian Federation inherited.  If Trump really wants peace, Trump should redouble support for Ukraine to stand against Russia and force them them table.",ObadiahtheSlim,2025-04-24T15:17:31,126
"But then what? Control a territory full of people who hate his peoples' guts? That leads to insurgency, and that leads to all sorts of shenanigans and silly billy activity.  source: Read several of Richard Marcinko's books, am expert on warfare and geopolitics.",ussbozeman,2025-04-24T16:43:03,19
Up to a point. North Korea only has so much previously manufactured ammo.  About 90%+ of what they are shooting is NK origin now. And they are nearly out of Cold War vehicles.,Unlucky-Prize,2025-04-24T15:49:21,3
Time is not on his side lmao. This subreddit has become completely insufferable the last few months.,DarthMaul628,2025-04-24T16:53:35,7
How does this help the war continue? If I watched my town and country be destroyed because of my own government's refusal to agree to a peace deal that would make me support a deal even more to end it. What is this world where people losing makes them want to fight more? It should be the opposite.,day25,2025-04-24T22:16:46,1
Ukraine won’t concede anything so of course there won’t be negotiations. They’ll just take the entire Ukraine.,BlackScienceManTyson,2025-04-24T16:31:52,-2

The Ukrainians had a decent peace deal two years ago that Boris Johnson helped sink. They got greedy and wanted Crimea back. The war is inconvenient because they are losing really hard.,BlackScienceManTyson,2025-04-24T16:35:11,-58

"If Ukraine will thrown an actual democratic election, and the people of Ukraine will decide in a certain manner, then I don't think anyone should stand in the way of that. But those that want to distance themselves from the stupid war, can also do so.",AstraVolans_21,2025-04-24T14:18:31,-50
"How many times are we going to hear this? In 2022 the Pentagon was predicting Russia would be done by early 2023, we are in 2025 right now. https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2022/dec/12/russias-ammo-rapidly-dwindling-may-begin-run-out-e/  Do you have a source for your claims that hasn’t being wrong in the last 3 years?

"I don’t think Putin wants all of Ukraine as I said he wants to leverage a better position with territorial conquest in peace negotiations.   Even if Russia managed to take all of Ukraine which I don’t think is possible but even if they did they’ve dealt with worse people than Ukrainians in an insurgency such as when they subjugated Chechnya.   Russia doesn’t have the same sunny disposition as the western liberal democracies in dealing with an insurgency.   They will absolutely brutalize the population for any acts of resistance just like they did in Chechnya as they don’t care about the people, they only care about the land.",KinGpiNdaGreat,2025-04-24T17:34:55,8

"Oh, I have no doubt that Biden's embarrassing display of American weakness on the world stage during the Afghanistan withdrawal contributed significantly to the outbreak of the Ukraine war. I'm not entirely sure if Trump could have prevented the outbreak if he had been president at the time, but the chance would have been a lot higher.  But getting out of a war is always far harder than getting dragged into one, and Trump unfortunately doesn't seem to have an actual plan, either.",Black_XistenZ,2025-04-24T19:50:30,-18
The peace deal which was on the table in Istanbul in 2022 had **not** yet addressed the key issues of this conflict:  https://www.intellinews.com/fresh-evidence-suggests-that-the-april-2022-istanbul-peace-deal-to-end-the-war-in-ukraine-was-stillborn-321468/  Did Boris goad Ukraine into becoming overconfident? Yes. Should they have been more humble with their goals in this war? Yes. Was there a ready-made peace deal on the table which could actually have ended the war in mid-2022 if only Ukraine had signed it? Hell no.,Black_XistenZ,2025-04-24T19:30:43,23

"I think you're misreading your own source. No one was claiming that ""Russia would be done by early 2023"". (It's also worth noting that Russia has been rapidly ramping up new artillery production.) Also your article was talking about artillery, not missiles. Russia is also sourcing substantial artillery from North Korea now which has very large stockpiles.  What, do you think Russia is sitting on a massive stockpile of weapons and is simply not using them?  We don't need to talk about ""sources"" here. Let's just talk rationality.",ergzay,2025-04-24T17:04:10,49

"I mean if you want direct sources of at least the tanks aspect, it's documented by Covert Cabal via satellite imagery.

"Perun is not a primary source.

"Covert cabal isn’t a primary source either. They are analyzing data(satellite imagery in this case). You need to prove that: 1. Their datasets are complete  2. Their methodology for analyzing these datasets is robust  3. They have a track record of making successful(and verifiable) claims using their methodology.   And I mentioned ISW for a very specific reason in context to Perun. The sources that Perun uses in his videos, often use ISW as a source in turn.   As an example in this video: https://youtu.be/rvCL15fsphE?si=GGjYIVtWP1y4fqSl  Perun uses Business Insider as a source on Ukraine’s improved EW: https://www.businessinsider.com/ukraine-hit-turning-point-electronic-warfare-capabilities-isw-russia-missiles-2024-1  Business Insider in turn is using the ISW as a source for their claims here.
