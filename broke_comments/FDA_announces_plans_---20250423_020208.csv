This is a win admittedly. It‚Äôs just a shame that when Michelle Obama wanted to make America healthy she was demonized by the right for overreach. Now the right are ok with it because wormskull is in charge and they probably think dyes cause autism.,ApplicationAfraid334,2025-04-23T02:11:19,52

"> The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced actions Tuesday to phase out the use of petroleum-based food dyes in U.S. food products, citing concerns over potential health impacts on children. >  > FDA Commissioner Martin Makary in remarks Tuesday pointed to studies that linked petroleum-based dyes to ADHD, obesity, diabetes, insulin resistance and cancer.

Forty-one percent of children have at least have at least one health condition, and 1 in 5 are on medication,‚Äù Makary said. ‚ÄúThe answer is not more Ozempic, more ADHD medication and more antidepressants.

This is great news. We'll see how difficult it is to implement with lobbyists and greedy corporate interests always in play. It would be awesome if the overall food industry was revamped and on a model similar to Europe's. Have visited many times and the food and options for food are vastly superior compared to here. I'm sure vastly healthier as well!,Illustrious-Bridge45,2025-04-23T14:53:34,1

"Chef here, Oranges when they're left out in the sun a bit too long they turn green ( perfectly acceptable to eat still ) however people think they're bad. So if dye is used to make the fruit look a more vibrant shade of orange people will think that they're juicier, sweeter or a better quality orange. Similar to why salmon is dyed pink.   Here in Australia we have a tonne of food waste due to the beauty standard of food ( of its not a victorias secret model its not worth eating ) I would assume it would be similar for you which is why you would dye the fruit orange ( able to sell more produce than toss the shittier fruit or give them to food banks/farmers for live stock )¬†",Various_Doubt_8191,2025-04-23T03:40:43,7
