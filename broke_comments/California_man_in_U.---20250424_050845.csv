">During the arrest, Munoz, sounding confused and alarmed, asked to see the warrant, especially since the ICE agents were initially calling him by another name.  Oh. I see. It's not that they were looking for him. He just fit their description. [Insert Family Guy race chart.]",sergemeister,2025-04-24T05:20:11,79
A snatch and grab in broad daylight while picking up his kids. Let's call ICE unleashed by Trump 2.0 what it is: Gestapo 2.0.,LazamairAMD,2025-04-24T05:20:39,55

"He has been here since 1990 and isn't a criminal. The ICE agents couldn't produce a warrant for the man or his wife.  This kind of flagrant abuse will sooner or later get somebody killed, when the person fights rather than be dragged into Trump's Blacksites.  Does anybody think the scumbag in the WH won't be using the same tactics against citizens, who don't meet the level of blind devotion he demands?",Unfair_Elderberry118,2025-04-24T05:31:29,40
"If you still need proof of what is going wrong in the USA. A man goes to school in the USA, works, pays taxes and is then deported. American citizenship would have been appropriate here for a long time, especially if you consider how much the American economy benefits from immigrants.",Spirited-Top3307,2025-04-24T05:49:09,11
"By Billal Rahman - Immigration Reporter:   A California man was on his way to pick up his children to take them to school in Manteca, around 70 miles east of San Francisco, when he was stopped by two unmarked vehicles.  What unfolded next was a moment of disbelief and fear that shattered a family and left them searching for answers.  [Juan Alejandro Munoz, 38, was detained](https://www.newsweek.com/father-detained-ice-drivers-license-2056696) by Immigration and Customs Enforcement ([ICE](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/ice)) agents on 19 February. His wife, Suri Ibarra, 36, told *Newsweek* she is devastated after his detention.

"I’ve mentored high school kids in this town through the botanical society. They have a huge immigrant population, as well as a lot of migrant farm workers. The kids are smart. Growing up around agriculture, they have a grasp of how botany and biology work already. Having their parents ripped from them by ICE is certainly going to harm their futures. Abducting parents during school runs is disgusting.",Faokes,2025-04-24T14:08:54,0

"ICE are pussies. They go after easy targets. None of them have the balls to go after a real armed gang member.
