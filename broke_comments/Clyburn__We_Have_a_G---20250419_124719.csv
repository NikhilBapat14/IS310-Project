"""That's what's killing us as Democrats, because we don't have a stomach for just lying.""  That's lie number one.  How about ""dictator on day one"". Or ""market manipulation"", maybe ""deport everyday Americans next"".   All they do is lie. They can't help themselves because the truth doesn't work for them. The lies make all these morons protest every day, firebomb Tesla dealerships and harass and harm all those who disagree with them.  Exactly what the left wants.

"Dude is delusional and the Party follows his lead at their own peril.  Clyburn  owns a lot of the blame for Biden being the candidate in 2020: ""[Clyburn calls for shutting Dem primary down, canceling debates after Biden surge](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/clyburn-calls-for-shutting-dem-primary-down-canceling-debates-after-biden-surge)"". He is a big reason Biden was the candidate up to the last minute in 2024 forcing out several other viable candidates. He pushed the SC primary ahead of others, invalidating the NH primary results. And icing on the cake- he was key in boxing the Party into accepting an uncontested Harris candidacy by endorsing her almost immediately. Now he's praising Harris with an eye toward another run in 2028 "" I think that she is a tremendous talent. I think she ran a great campaign...She was a great candidate, and I think she will make a great candidate in the future, whatever she decides to run for.""",Proof_Responsibility,2025-04-19T14:28:02,10
