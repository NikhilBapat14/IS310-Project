From Republican to Forward to Democrat. This guy is just chasing after votes. The DNC shouldn't spend a single penny on him.,PeterVenkmanIII,2025-04-24T10:50:10,30

"Though I commend Jolly for deciding to leave a craven, cowardly GOP party to become a Democrat, I feel it my obligation to to offer a cautionary note about trusting party defections - into or out of the GOP.   In November of 2022, one Tricia Cotham was elected as a Democrat for an NC House seat. Having campaigned as a strong supporter of abortion rights, health care, public education, gun safety and civil rights, [she flipped to the GOP party about 4 months later,](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/north-carolina-democrat-switches-parties-giving-gop-veto-proof-control-in-legislature) giving NC Republicans an instant, veto-proof majority to oppose then Governor Roy Cooper's efforts to better North Carolina. Needless to say, her betrayal led almost immediately to major harm to all of those issues that she had pretended to support in order to win her election.  I write this caution because I have personally witnessed too many instances of GOP duplicity and betrayal to think that a just-in-time conversion to Democrat is sufficient to trust that such a conversion is truly sincere... and to trust that it won't lead to ""letting the fox into the henhouse."" The GOP has shown itself to be quite proficient at hiding it's ""long game"" for years and springing it when it's too late to stop.  That said... I do hope that Jolly is sincere in his conversion, and that he can become a faithful democrat and an authentic Democrat. I'm afraid that I will take some time to believe in that reality...",phosdick,2025-04-24T15:13:41,1
"I’m a native Floridian Democrat and David Jolly is one of the few Florida Republicans I have ever had any respect for. I worked for a youth development program in Pinellas County that focused on underprivileged youth. We had multiple political figures from both sides of the aisle and differing municipalities hold events at one of our facilities. It usually went like this, staff gets 50-100 kids dressed in like shirts ready for a photo op with politician, said politician shows up an hour or more late, politician takes pictures for five minutes, his/her photographer complains that the kids are too rowdy, politician leaves never to be seen again. Politician doesn’t talk to kids, staff or anyone but their own people. Not with David Jolly. He would show up on time, talk to the kids, discuss issues with the staff, have a staff member snap a picture or two. I saw him eat the free lunch we gave out with a table of kids, play games with kids, actually talk to them about pokemon cards. He would show up in shorts, t-shirt and sneakers and play basketball till he was soaked with sweat. Now this was some years ago, and he was out of politics for a while but I’m guessing his swing to the Democratic Party is a good thing.",Sudden_Possibility33,2025-04-24T19:44:22,1
"Floridian here.  He's not the worst possible candidate, and I'll vote for him (his platform has nothing that'd cause me to abstain, since he's pro-choice now), but I highly doubt he wins. This is basically Charlie Crist 2.0 (funny, since Crist unseated him back in 2016)-and while I do think Crist isn't as bad a candidate as many people claim (especially on the left), he clearly did not have what it takes to even come close. This will admittedly be an open seat in at least a slightly blue year, unlike last time, and I guess Jolly didn't lose a bunch of times like Crist did (which might help), but unless Gaetz gets nominated somehow (highly unlike, the GOP is mostly split between Donalds and Casey DeSantis), I expect Jolly to lose-and with John Morgan also looking like he'll run (and thus split the vote, since it'll be as a third party), likely by double digits.  Gwen Graham backed him, so for better or worse, that tells me he's likely to be nominated with little opposition.",IvantheGreat66,2025-04-24T10:45:11,0

"He's not my favorite candidate at all, but how is he doing that?",IvantheGreat66,2025-04-24T11:17:57,-1
"I think it's kinda dumb to attempt a tactic that failed last time (and quiet badly), but I do want to ask you-who do you think should be the nominee?  Gwen Graham wants Jolly. Nikki Fried leads it and went on the StoneZone to talk with Roger Stone about if DeSantis and his wife will be indicted or something like that. Moscowitz voted to take trans kids' healthcare away. And Eskamani is not going to close the gap with Hispanics (in fact, the ones that still stick with Democrats will like ditch her in droves), especially Cubans, who Democrats likely need to win.  I guess outta all of these, I'd go with Fried and/or Eskamani, since it'd at least be a likely loss with someone I can stomach and they seem to want to be candidates to some extent, but still, I don't think Democrats have many people I like ideologically, or who can win.",IvantheGreat66,2025-04-24T11:24:05,1
">his platform has nothing that'd cause me to abstain, since he's pro-choice now  Honestly, is he pro-choice now? Or is he just saying that? What made him switch his stance on the issue?",PeterVenkmanIII,2025-04-24T10:59:35,3
"Corporations will send him plenty of cash to coast through the primaries to smash more progressive candidates, then pull the rug out in the general.",MentalTourniquet,2025-04-24T11:31:29,3
"That's his public position. It doesn't matter why to me, because ultimately most politicians set their stances based on what gets them elected, so all that matters is that he'll attempt to defend abortion rights should he be elected/nominated (because he would lose or at least have to fight to get nominated should he have kept his stance)-and since it's in his platform, I'm going to assume he'll do that until I see evidence on the contrary.",IvantheGreat66,2025-04-24T11:16:03,-1
"I mean, I guess that wastes their money, but it doesn't exactly steal their votes. It's a primary, it's meant to have people competing for them.",IvantheGreat66,2025-04-24T11:43:33,-1
">so all that matters is that he'll attempt to defend abortion rights  But will he? Politicians claimin a position only to back away from it after they're elected is a common thing, and a guy who was adamantly anti-choice for his whole political career suddenly switching his stance reads to me like a lie in order to try and get voters.  The evidence to the contray is his voting record.",PeterVenkmanIII,2025-04-24T11:43:25,2
"If he wins and goes anti-abortion, he'll get hit with a primary challenge, and considering he'd basically be set to lose the general with how many Democrats would abandon him, I can't see the state party tipping the scales to make sure no one opposes him. It's clear with his switch up that even assuming he's ingenuine, Jolly sees being anti-abortion as a danger, and it's more recent than what he did a decade ago.  Plus, he donated to a planned parenthood exec a decade ago, so there is some small evidence he had pro-choice sympathies.",IvantheGreat66,2025-04-24T11:47:55,1
