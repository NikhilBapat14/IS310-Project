"Dems are missing the messages. It’s not about this person, it’s about the process.  The person can be attacked and flaws found, the process protects us all.  It’s a better message to give in front of the jail (“we live in a world where the only thing keeping you out of this jail is Donald Trumps word that you’re not a criminal”)",Fireplaceblues,2025-04-17T18:41:09,-3
Dems. Dems are missing the message.   You know what? Fuck off. Fuck off into heavy traffic. Fuck off into an open manhole.   You miserable pissbags. A Democratic senator is probably risking his goddam life to find this guy and maybe save him and you have the fucking gall to whinge about how he's not nailing the message?   I fucking can't deal with this. Fascism is on the march across the country and we're sitting here talking about how the only actual opposition isn't doing things quite the way we'd suggest.  Fuck off into space.,Wrong_Confection1090,2025-04-17T20:49:23,8

"It’s about being effective and not just right.  Facism is on the march and we’re messaging the plight of one person.  It’s a terrible, sad, and frustrating story and everyone should feel as passionately as you do but guess what?  They don’t.  It’s complicated because people are complicated.  No amount of telling them to fuck off will break through.  It’s a crisis, tell people how it will affect them.  Dont stop telling them.",Fireplaceblues,2025-04-17T22:25:37,-1
