Yum! And the lead in water. Not hard to see how Trump is prez,Immediate_Concert_46,2025-04-24T14:17:02,7
"Not for much longer.    Not because the pollution is going away, but because it’ll stop being measured. Much cheaper to not know about it, unless you count the medical cost. Then it’s like ten times more expensive but hey at least no taxpayer is covering that nonsense!",Drolb,2025-04-24T14:17:45,6
"Seriously wonder how worse being inside versus being outdoors in a polluted city is for the average citizen.   Outdoor air might not be that great but that fresh air is still probably better than your hotbox apartment full of volatile compounds, particles, and CO2",Altruistic_Noise_765,2025-04-24T14:14:40,3

"I studied indoor air quality at university as part of my BSME. The air inside a dwelling can be worse than the air outside. If I remember correctly, for CO2 the concentration outdoors, is 400 ppm. In a house with low ACH that amount can reach 1000 ppm or higher. Newer homes without air filtration systems are particularly susceptible to elevated pollution levels because they tend to have a tighter building envelope and suffer from lower infiltration rates.    Opening your windows can help, but if you live near a busy street, then you're allowing black carbon to enter the dwelling.   Really, IMO, the best defense against indoor air pollution is to invest in a robust air cleaning system.",ThaddeusBurgleturd,2025-04-24T14:29:51,3
Excellent comment. What’s the most feasible robust air cleaning system for your average household in the US?,Altruistic_Noise_765,2025-04-24T14:31:23,1
"That I don't know. I mean, other than possibly ones with mechical filtration. I know there are other modes of removing air pollution, such as activated carbon for things like VOCs, and UV-C for destorying microorganizms and bateria.       What I do know is that any system that adds things to the air, like negative ions, should be avoided as they introduce ozone into the space.  Personally, I plan on installing an air conditioning system that filters air from the outside as it enters, then filters it again before going to the return. Since those types of systems can be expensive just purchasing an stand alone air cleaning until that uses mechanical filtration would be beneficial so long as the clear air delivery rate (CADR) is high enough. People can use a simple formula to figure out how many units they'd need in order to clean the air in a given space.   CADR(cfm) = 0.64\*area of space(ft\^2), Where, cfm = cubic feet per minute.  When purchasing an air cleaner look at the CADR or CFM listed for the unit and buy as many as you need to cover the calulated CADR. For example, my bedroom is 182 ft\^2. Using the formula:      CADR = 0.64\*182 = 116.5 cfm.       The air cleaner I currently own and keep in my bedroom has a CADR (for smoke) of 167. Since 167 > 116.5 I'm good to go, providing I replace the filters according to the manufacturer's recommendation.",ThaddeusBurgleturd,2025-04-24T15:35:36,1
