"Tax credits and subsidies are used to help direct a specific outcome. If that outcome is less reliance on fossil fuels and less pollution then the credits are valid.   The fossil fuel industry really gets to me personally. Like, it is not a renewable resource. We will run out. Period. Something will need to take its place eventually and the most effective thing we currently have that makes sense is a BEV.  What we should be subsidizing is updates to our electrical grid, advancement in electric storage technology and EV charging infrastructure.   We need to save the fossil fuels we still have for use in things we can’t currently replace with alternatives.",JasonSTX,2025-04-23T18:30:51,67

"The market should decide the fate of both electric AND gasoline cars.  The problem is that gasoline cars are effectively subsidized by things like government tax deductions for intangible drilling costs and favorable depreciation schedules for oil and gas operations, as well as (depending on your car type or your location) some federal or state manipulations of things like gas taxes or other incentives. In short, the price of gasoline (and larger gasoline cars) is lower in the USA than it should be because gasoline is artificially made cheaper by government programs.  On a completely fair playing field, owners of gasoline cars would have to pay higher gasoline costs, which would likely cause many to swap out to more efficient “greener” cars… Which ironically would reduce or remove the need for EV subsidies in the first place.",foulpudding,2025-04-23T18:39:19,19

"It's OK for the government to nudge consumers in the right direction, but subsidies on EVs are misguided.  When the government is put in the position of picking the winning technology, they often guess wrong. Government handouts increase the surface area for political corruption and cronyism.  A better approach would be a steep carbon tax, rolled out gradually but inexorably, to give industries and consumers time to adapt. It could even be revenue-neutral (with everyone below a certain income level receiving a rebate every year).  The idea is to make emitting carbon more expensive and let the free market determine the best solutions. EVs would likely be the winning technology for passenger cars, but there would also be incentives for more efficient ICE engines, hydrogen fuel cells, or natural gas (for larger vehicles). These are just the technologies that already existed. Who knows what other tech was starved of funding that might have otherwise emerged?  A carbon tax has the added benefit of encouraging less driving overall, smaller vehicles, and increased use of public transit. EV subsidies encourage our existing car-centric lifestyles while making cars even heavier. The Hummer EV 9,700 pounds, which is around 3 Honda Accords.  When it comes to grid power, the favoritism shown to solar, wind and biofuels likely slowed progress on small-scale nuclear reactors and geothermal, for example. Biofuels were always stupid and only exist because of legal bribery by giant agricultural companies.",judge_mercer,2025-04-24T10:42:52,1

Electric vehicles have been with us since the late 19th century and their fundamental flaw -- dependency on batteries -- has not been adequately addressed.  An alternative is needed to the battery.  Relying upon heavy, bulky, costly storage that requires rare earth metals is at best a stop gap, not an answer.  The need for substantial subsidies is an indication that the markets can see the flaws, as sales would not require subsidies if the product was ready for prime time.

"> Their assertion is that if EVs, as their proponents contend, are superior and cost-effective, they should be able to compete.  If the only cost associated with EVs vs ICE was simply the price tag of the item itself, this would be valid.  But that's not the point of the government subsidies or the reason why society as a whole should want to pivot towards EVs.  Nor does this address the fundamental entrenched position of ICE style engines possess due to existing infrastructure investments across the country.  It would be damn near impossible for EVs to ever win in an environment in which charging stations don't exist, where sheer engineering familiarity by car companies simply kept ICE engines cheap despite their not accounted for environmental impact (short and long term), where fuel is subsidized to a large degree that divorces it from reality.  Whether you give credits for EVs or start heavily taxing ICE engines for their pollution like you might cigarettes, at some point the government is going to put their thumb on the scale to help ""society"" and it's just a matter of picking which way is best.  As for the part about sourcing parts, etc.  Yeah, that's more problematic and it's one of those stupid elements to legislation that ends up over-complicating things.  The goal should just be to get to EVs.  Not mandating where the parts come from so much, or getting assembled here, etc.  All that does is drive up costs and require the subsidies to make EVs competitive.

"I think it’s perfectly reasonable for the government to subsidize particular industries to account for externalities that otherwise wouldn’t factor into price. There are a lot of negative externalities with internal combustion engine (ICE) cars, and so electric vehicles seem like an okay thing to subsidize. However, it turns out that a lot of the negative externalities of ICE cars also apply to electric cars: the death and dismemberment they cause, the particulate matter from brakes & tires, the costs to maintain roadways, the noise, the wildlife that is killed in collisions, etc. So in that sense, it seems a little ridiculous to subsidize electric vehicles but not e-bikes & robust public transit.  The one major advantage of EVs over ICE vehicles is that our foreign policy can care less about the price of oil. It would be great to not be worried about the threat of an oil embargo’s effect on oil prices.

"Maybe in an ideal world, but all monetary policy is intended to achieve sociopolitical objectives. What you seem to be advocating for is anarchy because monetary policy is how governments function.

In this case, as others have pointed out the oil and gas industries have been highly subsidized by tax payers for years under the premise that energy security is critical to our economy and security. This despite the fact that these forms of energy carry additional costs, externalities, due to things like air pollution and climate change.  EV tax credits are aimed at encouraging a pivot toward more sustainable transportation and energy storage and production. The economic argument is that the world is moving in the direction of sustainable energy and encouraging economic growth in this sector will position our economy to be more globally competitive as the world makes the transition.   You really miss the mark by suggesting that this is about a favored industry vs. tax payers. Ultimately this is obviously true, but it needs to be viewed more holistically.  I'd get behind elimination of 100% of corporate taxes incentives, mostly because this would help get money out of politics.

"I realize now that my figure was all lithium batteries, including small ones.    Honestly it's a little too soon to tell what will happen to most EV batteries. The number of total EVs has exploded in a the last few years so there aren't enough of them reaching their end of life to tell yet.    I'm actually pro-EV overall but there are still some issues to work out if we're going to replace all or nearly all gas cars with EVs. I would prefer if we retired some gas cars without replacing them.",thoughtsome,2025-04-24T13:00:31,1
