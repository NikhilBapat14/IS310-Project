"Huge turnout at Advance Polls, both the English and French debates are done and dusted, GOTV is in full swing, and momentum is good.Â    A week is still a long time in a 5 week election, but the energy is great.   My money is on a majority gov't for Carney.",JustAskingTA,2025-04-20T15:43:01,3
"I hope youâ€™re right the waiting is stressing me out. I would feel so much more relaxed knowing that carney would take on Trump. If anyone is keeping up or the shock and awe has disappeared, heâ€™s openly defying court orders. He will just get more powerful and we need a good leader to at least our economy back in check. In 4 years we will see where we are in world events.",tappatoot,2025-04-20T16:28:18,3
