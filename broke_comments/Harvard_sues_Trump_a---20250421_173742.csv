"Why are we the tax payer required to give Harvard, lt alone any institution,  money when they have a 50 billion dollar endowment.  Not that that the size of the endowment matters. We should be giving zero dollars to private universities.",Fred_Farkus,2025-04-21T19:31:42,100
Maybe I’m going to sue Harvard for not giving me a degree if this is how the world works now.,UltraAirWolf,2025-04-21T21:37:40,57

"Post on this in the Massachusetts sub where everyone is getting all high and mighty in support of Harvard   “Among the federal demands were requirements for Harvard to hire and admit students solely based on merit, eliminate racial preferences, and audit faculty and students for “viewpoint diversity.” The university was also ordered to screen international applicants for alignment with “American values” and report any violations of conduct to immigration authorities.”  This seems all reasonable but as I said in another reply I get why the socialists hate it given their stranglehold on higher ed group think",Imyourhuckl3berry,2025-04-21T20:52:17,38

"Ah, the old leftist conflation in which they see no distinction between refusing to pay for someone to do something and actively preventing them from doing it. This sounds like the Ivy League equivalent of “Pay for my birth control/abortions or you’re violating my reproductive rights!”",Plathismo,2025-04-21T19:46:35,17
"If our major colleges can't side with basic reality on very basic issues, than I have to question their relevance.",Cool_Cat_Punk,2025-04-21T21:47:42,9
"""How dare you not give me money"" the lawsuit.  Like a sugar baby suing a sugar daddy because he doesn't want to see you anymore.  Oh wait that's the (Pound)MeToo movement",mr_q117,2025-04-21T17:58:09,7
