"""Call an apothecary... But not for me.""  \- Samuel Whittemore",bhhhhhhhtyc,2025-04-19T17:25:29,348
"He was 78, and lived to 96, had 13 children that lived to adulthood, 120 living descendants when this happened, and is my ancestor so it’s guaranteed my family will bring it up if you come over for Thanksgiving.  He was basically unknown outside history nerds in Boston until Badass of the Week did an article, then a few YouTubers some years later.  Unfortunately, due to not being high profile there is a lot of uncertain information, with some sources getting who he married incorrect. We always knew he fought in the French and Indian War, but Wikipedia (when they finally expanded his article) says that is unfounded, and that he fought in the War of Austrian Succession. Perhaps over time through word of mouth people got the wars confused, since the latter is less well known. My family will just insist it’s all true now though even though they didn’t mention that war before xD",SpecialistNote6535,2025-04-19T17:05:54,298

"His story is more than that. He was fighting in wars at retirement age. The man was a badass.   Whittemore was in his fields when he spotted an approaching British relief brigade under Earl Percy, sent to assist the retreat. Whittemore loaded his musket and ambushed the British grenadiers of the 47th Regiment of Foot from behind a nearby stone wall, killing one soldier. He then drew his dueling pistols, killed a second grenadier and mortally wounded a third. By the time Whittemore had fired his third shot, a British detachment had reached his position; Whittemore drew his sword and attacked.[7] He was subsequently shot in the face, bayoneted numerous times, and left for dead in a pool of blood. He was found by colonial forces, trying to load his musket to resume the fight.",Up_Mac,2025-04-19T17:12:13,10

"Tangential Note: Chances are he was bayoneted by a Hessian soldier, not a British soldier. The Hessians (Germans) were known for that kind of thing in the Revolutionary War, while the Brits were (in general) tended to be a bit more honorable. Many stories of Americans surrendering and dropping their weapons, with their hands up, and the Hessians shot them or ""ran them through"" with their bayonets.",SpecialFree25,2025-04-19T21:41:10,12

"Yeah dude was fuckin’  Also, Whittemores in America (with that spelling, not Whitmore) are very likely to be descended. Four came over in the 1640s, including Sam’s father (maybe grandfather?), his (father or grandfather’s) brother, and two childless widows. The brother died childless (killed by Native Americans in some kind of dispute). No other Whittemores immigrated until two Canadian ones in the mid 1800s.  So if an American has the last name Whittemore it’s probably close to a 25% chance they’re descended from Sam.",SpecialistNote6535,2025-04-19T18:46:51,30
