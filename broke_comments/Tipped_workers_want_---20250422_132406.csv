Just pay them a fair wage and abolish tipping,Swagtagonist,2025-04-22T13:28:18,12
They should get one that covers the cost of living so that other workers aren't expected to subsidize their wages.,Penguin_Sushi,2025-04-22T13:27:17,6
Maybe stop letting more immigrants in and suppressing wages.,CRTsdidnothingwrong,2025-04-22T13:31:46,-18
I agree. They largely do not. They make bank on tips.,Katamari_Demacia,2025-04-22T14:38:44,3
"While there's a common concern that immigration lowers wages for native-born workers, most economic studies find little or no impact on wages for the average American worker [1, 2, 3]. Some studies even suggest that immigration can lead to wage increases for some groups, particularly for those with less education, according to research from the National Bureau of Economic Research | NBER https://www.nber.org/papers/w32389 [18]. [1, 2]   Here's a more detailed look: [1, 2]    • Studies with Neutral or Positive Effects: Many economists have found that immigration does not significantly reduce wages for native-born workers. Some studies even indicate that immigration can lead to wage increases, particularly for less-educated native workers. [1, 2, 3, 4]   • Immigration and Complementarity: Immigrants often complement native-born workers rather than competing with them directly. For example, low-skilled immigrant workers can allow native-born workers in higher-skilled occupations to specialize and increase their productivity, according to the Brookings Institute https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-immigration-means-for-u-s-employment-and-wages/ [1]. [1, 5]   • Immigration and Business Growth: Immigrant workers can also stimulate business growth by creating demand for goods and services, which can lead to increased employment and wages for both immigrants and native-born workers, says the Brookings Institute https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-immigration-means-for-u-s-employment-and-wages/ [1]. [5]   • Potential for Some Negative Impacts: Some studies have suggested that immigration may have a slightly negative impact on wages for low-skilled native-born workers in specific industries where they compete directly with immigrants. However, these effects are generally considered to be small and localized. [5]   • Wage Elasticity: Some research suggests that a 10% increase in the number of immigrants might lead to a 0.2% decrease in wages for native-born workers, but this is not a widely accepted finding, according to the Cato Institute https://www.cato.org/cato-journal/fall-2017/does-immigration-reduce-wages [7].   Generative AI is experimental.

"Do undocumented workers join the union and get paid union wages?  Can a company hire undocumented construction crews for less than union workers?  Does this make wages paid at a job site go up, down or stay the same?",TheQuarantinian,2025-04-22T15:34:11,-1
>Some studies have suggested that immigration may have a slightly negative impact on wages for low-skilled native-born workers in specific industries where they compete directly with immigrants.  Aka all the jobs that democrats now want to force higher minimum wage for. Can you imagine how much they'd have to pay to find a burger flipper if we had zero immigration for the last 30 years?,CRTsdidnothingwrong,2025-04-22T13:50:54,-6
Yummy conjecture. Can I have some more?,PresidentTroyAikman,2025-04-22T16:34:27,2
“I’m going to zero in on one specific sentence that only barely agrees with me and ignore everything else.”  You,PresidentTroyAikman,2025-04-22T14:02:45,5
I do not think that word means what you think it means.  There is no conjecture here: I am asking you yes/no questions.,TheQuarantinian,2025-04-22T17:16:21,-1
You’re ignoring information that destroys your assertion. Do proceed.,PresidentTroyAikman,2025-04-22T19:41:01,2
