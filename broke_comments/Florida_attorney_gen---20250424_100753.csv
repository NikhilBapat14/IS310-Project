"So, now a state AG is ignoring a court order. Republicans are just embracing lawlessness all the way down.",Ancient_Popcorn,2025-04-24T10:09:15,36
That same AG is part of the transfer of the $10 million from the Medicaid taxpayers refund. $57 million was supposed to go back to the State fund. Instead $10 million was siphoned off into DeSantis' wife's charity... then directly given to the AG's own political pac to fight the recreational Marijuana legalization campaign. This is a Mafia state.,williamgman,2025-04-24T10:18:37,17

Under what authority?,ITZOURTIMENOW,2025-04-24T10:26:48,4
The judge should target the individual cops themselves.  We should treat this like the mafia. Start at the bottom and work our way up. Make it clear that the guys at the top won't protect them.,Logical_Hare,2025-04-24T12:36:05,4

That same AG took in $10m illegally thru DeSantis wife's charity for his own pac fund.,williamgman,2025-04-24T10:20:00,20

Time to disbar the AG...,Beantown-Jack,2025-04-24T10:58:15,4
"They're spinning the interpretation of the ruling, much like the Trump administration is doing: > In a court filing on Wednesday, Uthmeier’s office argued that the case, brought by immigrants and advocacy groups challenging the new state law, only applies to the named defendants: his office, Florida’s statewide prosecutor and the various state attorneys in Florida. State lawyers said the ruling does not apply to “independent” law enforcement agencies, such as the Highway Patrol, FDLE, county sheriffs’ offices and local police.",aleph32,2025-04-24T11:35:08,3
