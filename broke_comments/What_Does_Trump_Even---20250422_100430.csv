Short term is his ego boost.  How dare someone go against him.   Man is an idiot and only cares about his own feelings.,Albireookami,2025-04-22T10:05:56,45
"he gets to choose who replaces powell.  someone who will simply do what trump tells him and when.  there wont be any fiscal policy, just chaos.  at first the rates will go down, which will probably give another uptick to the market, which trump and friends will insider trade on.  then he will shout to the heavens and all of maga world that he fixed the economy by removing the terrible powell from office.  saying that he is personally fixing things to be the best they will ever be.  then with lower rates, borrowing will increase, debt will explode, but this wont actually affect the average person. but then eventually, probably within months, due to keeping the rates low without care of whats happening behind the scenes, something will trigger another collapse like the 2008 financial crisis.  and trump will again claim its powells fault for is ""terrible"" policy leading us to this unavoidable collapse.  that he(trump) did everything he could, but the courts, and democrats dragged things on for too long and that they are at fault for the economic collapse.   Then the bailouts begin.  and first up will of course be every major political donor.  then every ""friend"" of the family, and then smaller donors who either have been consistent or are new big spenders with big pledges trying to get on trumps good side to save themselves.  By this point its too late for anyone in the GOP to stop trump from anything he tries to do.  trump would have firmly placed the blame on the courts and democrats for delaying his(trumps) efforts to save the economy.  opposition to trump now means no bailouts for you or your states people.  now its time for trump to push for vastly more control over fiscal policy, government spending, taxes and anything else related.  eventually trump begins to claim that America cannot afford for him to leave office due to the ""extreme"" situation.  referencing wartime situations where the president cannot be asked to step down while the country ""needs"" him.  now that the next election cycle gets skipped, the maga GOP gains new power and control due to unwavering support of trump, and the internal battle of heir to the empire begins behind the scenes.  the maga gop will then do everything they can to never allow a presidential election with democrats involved again blaming them for the worst economic collapse in history.",VOIDsama,2025-04-22T10:23:09,11

"Short term gain is trump can point to low interest rates and claim that as a major win for his platform. He'll boast about it the lowered interest rates as an indicator that he has control of the economy. His supporters will eat it up, without question.   But that won't last all that long as inflation will quickly start to rise again in response. At that point, trump will find another scapegoat to blame and the cycle more or less repeats.",LW_GLAZER,2025-04-22T10:42:35,0

Long term it’s the same. He wants to always punish any dissent. He demanded to have weather people fired for correctly reporting the weather.   The goal is complete obedience from everyone. It’s literally fascism.,notamermaidanymore,2025-04-22T12:22:18,2

If he lowers interest rates then the interest on the debt will decline.  So that becomes less urgent and so govt spending can increase.  That gooses the economy.  That goose papers over the decline in the economy from tarrifs.  But it does potentially allow companies to borrow money cheaply to build out domestic production.  However it's unlikely they will since the uncertainty on how durable that tarrif is.  Mostly I think he wants to I believe able to blame the comming collapse on Powell.  So he might even be hoping he is thwarted,Relevant-Rhubarb-849,2025-04-22T10:55:22,1
"he wont be able to say ok we are at 2% day one or anything, but he can certainly say they will begin lowing rates and as soon as possible implement rate cuts.  probably .25 or .5 to begin.  i doubt the rest of the FOMC will be able to stop whoever is appointed from cuts like that.  remember, if the fed chair can be ""fired"" so can they.",VOIDsama,2025-04-22T14:55:16,1
