"Honestly, the whole ""good or bad"" debate around Trump's tariffs feels intentionally fuzzy—it’s like an endless, shifting project designed specifically to never have clear benchmarks. Without setting an actual definition of ""success,"" Trump can easily change the narrative whenever he wants. If jobs tick up slightly, he claims victory. If consumer prices spike, he pivots blame onto China, Democrats, or globalists. It's perpetual political cover: always vague enough to justify his actions, deflect criticism, or shift blame, all without accountability.  But hey, that's just my crazy tin foil hat opinion.",gk_instakilogram,2025-04-04T20:24:37,25
"This is great, but the administration is already promising that the outcome is going to be more money, jobs, etc. etc. blah blah blah.  So they’ve already set what the talking point for “good” is.  The only sensible discussion to have is how that’s blatantly wrong because of how regressive tariffs are.",MetalDrumFan,2025-04-04T20:26:02,8
"This isn't rocket surgery. Tariffs can be used in specific ways to support certain industries or protect vital manufacturing. Canada's dairy tariffs on the US are a perfect example. They allow free trade of dairy, up until a certain quota of imports is achieved, which Canada believes will harm their domestic industry. Those quotas have never been crossed, but Canada understands it is important to protect domestic production.   Fat Donny is placing broad tariffs on every country in the world, except Russia (why?), including countries that export nothing to the United States, and don't actually have any citizens. This isn't an economic plan. This isn't ""good"" or ""bad"". This is just fucking stupid.   Every notable economist in the country has been saying since Trump first suggested these tariffs, that they were a recipe for disaster. For a while, Fat Donny flirted with tariffs, on and off, on and off, as if he wasn't sure. Then yesterday he hit EVERYBODY (except his buddy Putin), like a gambler going all-in. Now we are told to ""trust the President"", as if he doesn't have the longest list of fiscal failures in American history. We're told to wait and trust, as we watch economic indicators crash. Based on what? What history of success does this fat orange moron have that we should trust that he's not making another colossal fuck up?  I hope all the MAGA supporters remember this moment. When they blindly supported a moron as he drove us all off a cliff.",BluesSuedeClues,2025-04-04T21:14:38,8
Asking about criteria for good or bad is a valid exercise in many contexts - however these tariffs like so many of DonOld’s efforts are not about a conventional strategy - their plan is about the destruction of US democracy and social care - for breaking up bits for sale to the highest bidders -,peaceisthe-,2025-04-04T21:27:20,3
"In the tariff debate, defining “good” or “bad” depends entirely on the perspective and priorities of the evaluator.  Economics is trade-offs.  One group’s benefit may come at another’s expense.  There’s no universal standard for “good” or “bad” tariffs; because differing metrics of success.  Even the most objective measure, like net economic welfare, obscures real disparities.",already-redacted,2025-04-04T21:36:04,2
"Coherence fallacy. You are making the erroneous assumption that there is a rational motive behind these tariffs, driven by some logical calculus. There is not.",lowflier84,2025-04-04T22:00:12,2
"Trump's bizarro nonsensical formula is here:  https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/04/03/trump-tariff-formula/  Trump's belief is that the US running a trade deficit is an indication that the US is being cheated.  In other words, other nations deserve to be punished if they have the audacity to sell stuff to Americans that Americans want to buy.   This makes as much sense as shouting at the staff of my local supermarket because I give them more money than they give to me.  Which is to say that it doesn't make a damn bit of sense.",I405CA,2025-04-04T23:01:21,2
"No one in the administration knows what’s success is least of all trump. Today he is claiming to be tanking the stock market on purpose, if it goes back up he’ll claim credit for that, if we go into a recession he’ll just keep blaming Biden. It’s just Calvinball and has no point.",Gaz133,2025-04-04T20:46:47,3
"That's not a ""crazy tin foil hat opinion"", that's just the observable pattern with Donald Trump. All successes are his doing alone, all failures are the fault of the opposition. He makes no mistakes, and every accusation is false. You would slap your children for behaving this way, but we tolerate it in a rich, old, white fat man.",BluesSuedeClues,2025-04-04T21:21:00,11
">except Russia(why?)  I think it's because Russia is still under sanctions, so they don't do trade at all.",agent218,2025-04-05T17:00:07,1
"Bidders? They don't intend to sell the departments of Federal government to oligarchs, they intend to give them away. They're fucking up the function of government to the point that they can insist ""it doesn't work"". Then they will claim it is more ""efficient"" to have private entities running those functions and turning a profit off of them. And half of American votes will cheer, as their benefits dwindle.",BluesSuedeClues,2025-04-04T21:36:16,1
"*“We are going to have a crash and we’re going to have a crash like a 1929 crash if she gets in,”* \-Trump 2024",BluesSuedeClues,2025-04-04T21:27:59,3
"Google says; ""In 2024, the total goods trade between the United States and Russia amounted to an estimated$3.5 billion, with U.S. exports to Russia at $526.1 million and imports from Russia at $3.0 billion, resulting in a trade deficit of $2.5 billion for the U.S.""  Now obviously those aren't big numbers in international trade, but it still begs the question of why Trump wants tariffs for our closest allies, but not Russia. I mean, hell, he put tariffs on places that have zero exports to the U.S., but NOT RUSSIA. And by his idiot math, those numbers suggest Russia is ""taking advantage of us.""",BluesSuedeClues,2025-04-05T17:08:02,1
