"Yeah… there’s lots of spaces where plenty of people are free to say and even do what they like about the President, his administration, and its policies & lawful orders. The military is simply not one of them, full stop.",MCRNRocinante,2025-04-21T22:38:05,74
Do these upper command MILITARY people really think it is a good idea to go against your Commander in Chief?  Time for them to retire before they end up in a court martial.,mdws1977,2025-04-22T00:16:43,34
This headline makes so much more sense than the other one about this topic. Maybe writing headlines isn't as easy as I think?,DickCheneysTaint,2025-04-22T07:30:40,3
"that is not why she was suspended though. at least not yet. her diversity comments were the more likely reason,indicating a misunderstanding of how to create an effective fighting force",SerendipitySue,2025-04-22T13:24:16,5
"Looking at her, I don’t see a physically fit warfighter that commands respect.  Of course she doesn’t like the current administration, it stands in stark opposition to the kind of foolish culture that would ever promote such a dumpy, physically and obviously morally weak person to any kind of command role.  For the record, I didn’t care for Stuart Sheller’s antics, either.  I thought he was a narcissistic, self aggrandizing prick.  If you are a military officer you swore to obey the orders of the President and your chain of command.  Period.",RazorSlaked,2025-04-22T04:53:15,25

"Not sure how she got a command position when she for sure can't pass height and weight and probably can't pass the ACFT.   She's not just over weight, she's obese. You don't get that way over night.",BobBee13,2025-04-23T11:06:23,1
A lot of them were hired to do just that by the last partisan administration.,kaytin911,2025-04-22T07:10:15,17
