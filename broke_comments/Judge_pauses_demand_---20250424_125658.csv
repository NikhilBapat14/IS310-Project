"Pausing until April 30th, probably on the basis of a promise from Trump's side--a promise they won't ever keep, but which gives them more time.  After more than a month of this complete obstruction, Judge Xinis clearly just doesn't want a fight with the DOJ.  Hopefully, she wasn't bluffing about holding them accountable, but it certainly seems like it now.  Who knew how weak our court system really is when faced with a president and DOJ who don't believe they have to cooperate, that whatever the President wants IS the law?",FIlm2024,2025-04-24T13:05:01,11

Or maybe Trump agrees with Garcias attorneys to get Garcia out and make the case go away via settlement so the courts won‚Äôt be forced to rule against him. Thus stranding all the other people they kidnapped and preserving the power to keep disappearing people if they want to. I feel like that‚Äôs the main goal. They need to be able to disappear people.,Sea-Replacement-8794,2025-04-24T16:24:05,1
