"No. None of this is grounds for disqualification. The only thing the PTA does is facilitate the process. Without it, then Trump starts day 1 on Jan 20 ""cold"". There was an article that used that phrase but I can't find it.  There \*is\* an article here that I found that complained of unnecessary risk by not signing it.  [https://federalnewsnetwork.com/federal-newscast/2024/11/gsa-opens-access-to-transition-resources-for-trump-team/](https://federalnewsnetwork.com/federal-newscast/2024/11/gsa-opens-access-to-transition-resources-for-trump-team/)  This article talks about how without the agreement, Trump people cannot get the necessary clearance to start easing their way into handling the agencies. They would suddenly get everything thrown at them on Jan 20.  [https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/23/trump-team-barred-from-agencies-amid-legal-standoff-00191399](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/23/trump-team-barred-from-agencies-amid-legal-standoff-00191399)  You can find even more talks about the transition process here in this wiki page. I got the above articles from it too.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second\_presidential\_transition\_of\_Donald\_Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_presidential_transition_of_Donald_Trump)  Regarding the Hatch Act, this wiki list has a lot of examples alleged violations but what you'll notice is that most of them get away with it scot-free or with very little punishment. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatch\_Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatch_Act)  It's not really enforced all that much when it's violated. You can get warnings like with Karine Jean Pierre or Marcia Fudge or heck, it can even be ignored in the case of Kellyanne Conway. Even when you get to a level beyond that, it's just fines like with Perdue. Theoretically a removal can happen but I don't see any examples of it actually happening.  In summary, no, this is not a disqualification situation and not even legal analysts have grabbed onto this theory which is probably the biggest sign that this disqualification theory is a no-go. It would be crazy to overturn an election simply because he didn't meet some statutory deadline that was really more about making things easier for the transition process. If anything, disqualifying a candidate this late in the game would cause an even bigger headache for everyone as well creating political chaos nationwide, which would go against the spirit of the law of lessening headaches.",JustASumoGuy,2025-01-06T20:32:54,1
">Regarding the Hatch Act, this wiki list has a lot of examples alleged violations but what you'll notice is that most of them get away with it scot-free or with very little punishment.  It should be noted that the Hatch Act has no criminal or civil punishment for violating it. Violations of the Hatch Act result in punishment decided by the superior of the violating actor or by Congress through Impeachment or some other remedy.",ProLifePanda,2025-01-07T07:42:33,1
"Thanks for researching. Did you know that Kennedy was the person that was championing the Transition act in 1963 and then he was killed. It was the cold war, cuban missle crisis, Mcarthyism, proxy wars between leftest rebels all over the world.   The Korean war was in full swing.   I wonder why you would think ""starting cold"" is exceptable for a nation like ours?",Organic-Coconut-7152,2025-01-06T20:41:16,0
"It's a bit different now. They changed it so that the MSPB decides the disciplinary measure instead of the President, as a reaction to how much the Trump Admin let their officials get away with.

I never said it was acceptable. I'm only telling you that it's not grounds for something like disqualification which would definitely make things worse.,JustASumoGuy,2025-01-06T21:08:35,1
"Oh, nice. Looks like this was issued this year and I was just recalling my research from Trump's first term.  I wonder if Trump can just instruct the new OLC to issue a new memo reversing this decision.",ProLifePanda,2025-01-08T07:23:04,1
"There are preventable events In history that derive from small avoidable failures because people were complacent in their operation of complicated systems.   For me, The first shocking one was the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.  “There was a ‘launch fever’ at the time, to try to get these missions off on time, and get more missions going,” he said.  That type of thinking played a significant role in the disaster, experts have concluded. Challenger was lost because a rubber “O-ring” seal on the shuttle’s right-hand solid rocket booster failed, allowing hot gas to escape and damage the orbiter’s external fuel tank, as well as the gear that attached the booster to the tank.” https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/challenger-disaster-30-years-ago-shocked-the-world-changed-nasa/  A scientist had spent hours trying to scrub the mission before it was too late. It was too late and this nation lost 6 astronauts and a teacher in front of a nation full of children.   NASA had to do a reckoning and lost valuable momentum.   This was a preventable accident which is different than what Trump has been doing.   Trump is intentionally being in contempt of the process. He signed the law that shortened the Presidential Transition Enhancement act of 2019 to be one month shorter than what has been customary and did not sign the MOU until late November and the 3rd Day of December.   Now he is creating talking points that are claiming that Biden is causing his Transition to fail.   Why would the person that signed the law delayed the signing and blame someone else do such a thing?   Do we need to know why? Or just that it is more dangerous than an O ring?  There is a reason there is a maxim of “its better to be safe than sorry.”  The 1963 Presidential act is a filter to protect the people from people with shady ethics by putting them into the view of our Justice department for nearly 5 months.   Looking for enemies foreign or domestic.  Donald shortened that to 32 business days and is blaming other people for his failure. To me that is suspicious enough to say “no thanks”. I would rather be safe than sorry.  I don’t need to know the particulars.    Every one has a “sorry Story, that they could have been safe in”   Red flags over looked, friends concerned warnings, gut instincts ignored, financial betrayals of Trust, betrayals of faith and the heart. So many that they have become tropes to watch out for  What is yours? Would you tell an Internet stranger where you made a bad call even though the evidence was there?",Organic-Coconut-7152,2025-01-06T23:43:43,0
"I'm not sure I appreciate the rather antagonistic tone you're giving me. You're being absolutely hyperbolic by using the worst case scenarios in order to justify your obvious desire to disqualify him by using a bunch of what ifs and unrelated events as analogies. Elections have consequences, and sometimes they can be bad consequences. But a democracy lets the people deal with the consequences of their choices and ultimately they chose Trump, for better or for worse. If you're just using this opportunity to be hysterical and moralize about why you think Trump is unfit, then I'm not really interested in continuing this conversation.  For me, this subreddit is to answer questions in an educational way without deteriorating into partisan mudslinging, which imo is what you're baiting me into. It is my hope that by the end of every conversation I have in this thread, that it is difficult to discern who or which party/ideology I personally support. You asked a question, and I gave an answer for why I didn't think it would happen and why I didn't think it should happen. That's it. I figured that despite your obvious dislike of Trump, that there could still be an educational discussion about the transition process in general. Hence why I gave my initial answer. Clearly, I was wrong.  Have a nice day.",JustASumoGuy,2025-01-07T02:02:41,1
