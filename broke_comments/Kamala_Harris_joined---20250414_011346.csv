"Stupidity is also contagious and often incurable.. this is why we are in  the situation we are in today. The way forward is now more difficult then ever… be kind to each other pay it forward not back. Educate instead of hate… reach out and show your neighbors that United we can stand but divided we will fall… The United States has never not been great! Do not let them divide us, and keep trying only when you give up have you truly been defeated.",Wjsmith2040,2025-04-14T01:31:03,32
