"Pete is one of the smartest, most eloquent people in politics today, and he understands what working people want and need. It'd be fun to have a beer with him. We need more of him and more people like him.",biaggio,2025-04-24T22:06:34,1
"What a beautiful family!  Ever since 2020, I have dreamed of Pete Buttigieg, becoming our president.",dokikod,2025-04-24T22:34:51,1
"Maybe I need to watch the interview, but I was hoping the article would describe the plan.  What I read in there was a precise vision I agree with, but I'm left to infer the plan.  My assumption is that it's more of the pre trump type politics.",KingThar,2025-04-24T22:12:17,1
I knew I liked this guy. I would have voted for him in a minute. Too bad this country is such a piece of shit that they couldn't bare to have a gay man as head of our country.,SatoriFound70,2025-04-24T23:06:50,1

"I don’t want politician it would be fun to have a beer with, I want politicians who will govern for the good of all Americans. That’s it, my one requirement that is lacking in the majority of people in federal office.",Professional-Can1385,2025-04-24T22:42:07,1

"Yeah, it's a great plan, but they panned over it. Can't give gay Pete a chance to get his message across. Just hype him for the sensational aspect. Never minded it is substance. Libs cheer for no other reason, just as conservatives jeer him for his sexual orientation. The ""press"" just gloats. So sad!!!",Head-Simple-3329,2025-04-24T22:39:25,1
