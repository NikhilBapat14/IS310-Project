Don’t blame the rest of the world for avoiding the us. We have citizens going from New Mexico to Arizona being detained and threatened with “deportation.”,IRideMoreThanYou,2025-04-22T14:43:13,21
"Even if you feel like ""there is no way I'd get detained"", the world should collectively agree to protest America by not buying American products & not spending money on tourism/vacations until we are no longer a fascist state. Period. All these fascist sympathizers in America will only react if you hurt their bank account. Stop coming to America, stop buying American. Make us suffer for our fucking choices.",CosmicLars,2025-04-22T14:49:50,18
"The thing with insinuating that everyone is your enemy is that people start acting accordingly. They keep saying that you are trying to sneak into the USA, that you are cheating it, that they are the greatest and you are somehow lesser for a variety of ever changing reasons, that your countries are weak and your democracies bad, that they want to invade you and take your stuff, that you're a communist or a terrorist, ... So why would you go there and put yourself at their mercy?  Even if you don't believe you could end up being targeted because of some random international incident that they create on a whim, you're still at risk. This is a government that deliberately sets out to ruin the world economy just to make the vainglorious buffoon at the top and his hateful followers feel better about themselves. It will absolutely empower lower ranked assholes in its employ to ruin your holiday so they can act out their own petty power trips.  What better way to start of your care free holiday than to feel a hostage that is at best tolerated by, at worst a sacrifice for and at any rate a contributor to the fascists that run the place?",barryvm,2025-04-22T14:54:29,9
"Come to America! Get a free tour of ice detention centers with your very own set of prisoner clothes. After our lean diet of potentially expired food and lack of due process you will return to your home grateful and refreshed. All you need to do is go through our mind numbing process to enter the country but not book a full 5 weeks of hotels. Even white teenage Germans will get this oh so special treatment.   So come one and all to the place that hates anyone different than maga! You too can be part of history as america collapses into becoming the next russia or North Korea! How very exciting! Be sure to thank dear leader for this most precious opportunity. /s  Serious though, please don't come here. This country is insane and you should not put yourself in harms way like that.",TheJadeGoddess,2025-04-22T15:03:32,7
I don't feel like being strip searched right now. Maybe when I'm a little more comfortable with my body.,Zeta411North,2025-04-22T15:59:10,4
There should only be 2 categories of foreign visitors to the US:   1. You have close family or friends and they cannot see you outside the US   2. You have booked non refundable vacation and the costs outweigh the risk  No one else should be risking their lives to visit the US when there's plenty of other destinations,Old_Window86,2025-04-22T14:49:26,8

"> until we are no longer a fascist state  Maybe that day is coming, but what about all the fascists who voted Trump in?    To me, that is the real revelation.  Trumpism was there all along.  Even when the man leaves (however that happens), all of what allowed him to go there, allowed him to do it twice.   Terry Pratchett once said “Poison goes where poison is welcome”, and I will never forget how welcome poison has ever been in those United States.",nanobot001,2025-04-22T16:57:55,9

"The not buying American bit is going to be quite hard from the UK for a lot of us as we don't actually get much physical day to day stuff from Yankland, but rely on a lot of internet and financial services infrastructure.    Not travelling there until 2029 is a good one to commit to though.",bowak,2025-04-22T14:57:23,6

"Frankly, even amidst all the frightening reasons that are obvious not to travel to the US right now. It's not even like you lose out here in Canada.  As an example here in BC for instance. We have one of the few remaining rain forests in the World to explore on the west coast. There's daily ferry rides you can enjoy with breathtaking ""super natural"" scenery and it's not in unheard of seeing whales along the way.",Thund3rbolt,2025-04-22T15:10:13,2
The Canadian side of Niagara falls is actually the better side anyway.   That's not just patriotism. All the cool pictures of the falls you see? Those are in Canada.,Zeta411North,2025-04-22T16:06:30,6

"They will never care, at least not in anyway that will change their minds.

They're enabled by a rigged system. But fixing our voting system would strip them of their unearned power,DancingWithAWhiteHat,2025-04-22T21:27:45,2
"Honestly, I don't think a Democrat win in 2029 is going to fix everything. How many times does one of your best friends have to punch you in the face before you decide they're a psycho and can't be trusted. For me it's once.  The truth is that as things stand right now, the US is only ever 4 years away from more of this insanity. Fixing the trust will take generations and that's if the US can ever shut down all the right wing propaganda shit pipeline.",BahBah1970,2025-04-22T17:29:48,6

"I need to reiterate when I have been saying from November 2024.  There will never be another free and fair election the US. (Well not until the 2030’s at least) Trump and team will: - legislate voting rights against those who oppose him, by gender (already happening) by race (has happened) and then by financial status.  - he will alter, restrict or kill data that opposes his regime - he will if necessary call on a number of legal Acts to disrupt elections and ensure he stays in power or at the very least he will continue to control the US via a quasi puppet President.   History shows the United States as it was known to many is finished - and only a complete reset of the political system will address it.  It’s also worth noting that the Democratic Party and Fox News have allowed this evil regime to take hold.  Fox by design and the Democrats by favouring the share market over a living wage.",Wild_Savings4798,2025-04-22T21:37:43,3
