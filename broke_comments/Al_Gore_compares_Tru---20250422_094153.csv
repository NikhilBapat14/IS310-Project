"Fascism is a far-right, authoritarian political ideology that emphasizes strong nationalism, and often a dictatorial leader. It typically involves suppression of political opposition, control over the media, use of propaganda, glorification of the state and militarism, rejection of democracy and individual rights, and scapegoating of perceived enemies, often based on race, ethnicity, or ideology.  MAGA is literally the textbook definition of fascism.",theassassintherapist,2025-04-22T09:42:56,653

"We need to normalize this analogy, as it is correct. The right has tried to create this stigma that Hitler and the Nazis = the Holocaust. The Holocaust was only the final few years of a nearly 20 year rise to power of Hitler and the Nazis and their Fascism.

Nazis, brownshirts, magas, it's all the same thing.

"There is some basis for comparison. Both Nazis and MAGA:  >cult of personality around the leader  Self explanatory   >intitiated authoritarian takeovers of the government   We’re in the middle of one now that mirrors much of what Hitler did. Our systems are different, but Trump is attacking institutions to bring them to heel (universities, law firms, media orgs, corporations, etc). He’s also reportedly considering forcing the army to sign a loyalty pledge, which would be a direct imitation of Hitler.  The Republican Party is dickriding him without shame and giving him North Korean style praise. And his appointments are incompetent hacks that are loyal to only him, so Hitler-seque but with lower standards.   >were military aggressive and territorially acquisitive   Trump has threatened to take over Greenland and Canada so far, although he hasn’t taken action yet he said he will “stop at nothing.” Were also being hyper aggressive in initiating a trade war against Everyone on the planet   >intimidated political opponents   Trump has sworn again and again that he’ll go after his political enemies and has gone to lengths to punish people who weren’t sufficiently loyal to him in his first term. His pettiness and vengefulness is boundless. Unlike the Nazis, the intimidation is largely directed at personal beefs and those who don’t obey his commands so far, but it won’t necessarily stay that way.    >victimized a hated group and sent them to gulags   Pretty self explanatory here",airbear13,2025-04-22T18:55:43,2

"> this is the part where you stop arguing ideas  No, it's the part where I point out the deceits and holes in your argument and wait for you to say something worth responding to properly.  > you keep saying “it still means ultranationalism, purity myths, leader worship” like that list is some sealed bible verse  We're arguing about the definition of a thing, so it's deeply bizarre for you to pretend to be surprised to find me arguing my position about the definition of that thing.  > nobody said “all control is fascism.”  By your definition, all control comes under fascism. That's the problem with your laughable effort to expand it to include people being cancelled, you've ended up with your own special little ridiculous definition.  > pretending corporate-state speech coordination isn’t a red flag  Again with the lies. Nobody was suggesting that isn't a bad thing. But it's not fascism. This is the problem with your current position - you know it's absurd, so you're reduced to just playing with your own little strawmen.  > it’s not the flags or the boots or the accent.   Yeah, I know. That's why none of those things made an appearance in anything I said.   > it’s the structure.   The point I made, which you seem determined to fail to respond to, is that an ideology is not the tools that are used to promote it. And while fascism is closely tied to its tools, they are not its ideology.",DaveChild,2025-04-23T12:15:39,2

"So, is Bukele a Nazi? Is Maduro a Nazi? Was Napoleon a Nazi? See what I mean? By all means, compare them, but they arent Nazis. That was a different dictator's regime.   The world has had many dictators and, sadly, probably always will. I think it's better to use language objectively in these matters.

"Just because I disagree with you doesn't mean I'm neither real nor serious. I think calling him a Nazi is alienating. Sharpcookie makes good points but trump is still, literally, not a Nazi. You aren't going to change any minds by calling him one.    Look, I believe musk either threw that salute on purpose or at the very least knowingly embraced it after the fact. I think Trump's comments about Charlottesville were hideous. Hegseth's tattoos are concerning. But bigotry and hate take many forms and we are short changing our language to just call them all Nazis.   The commentor I originally replied to asked ""why wouldn't I call him a Nazi"". I pointed to a reason in the first few paragraphs of the article that OP posted here.  Anyways, we agree more than we disagree.

"The buildup to a fascist takeover of the USA has been decades in the making. This is not something that happened overnight, or even over the course of the last decade.  It is the result of systematic issues within the culture and legal systems of the United States.   In terms of legal systems: government and presidential violation of the constitution with no consequences is nothing new, and the corporate takeover of the government is nothing new either - only now has it come to fruition in the wake of lobbying and the Citizens United case.  In terms of culture: Conservatives in the USA have based their ideologies around the exemplification of the nation above all else - even above human rights. It's why the Patriot Act was able to be passed without any protest from Conservatives, and it's why any protest of conservative administrations' actions are deemed ""un-American"" by Conservatives. And this isn't even mentioning the otherization and dehumanizing of racial minorities, nor is it bringing up the glorification of violence among American Conservatives. *Edit: these things have been incorporated, subtly or explicitly, into the very culture of American Conservatives.  So, no, ""just come together"" is not a solution here. And if you think it is, then I cannot stress enough that you simply are not thinking hard enough about the social and political climate of the USA.",BeenEvery,2025-04-22T13:16:36,1
