Not to get all serious but that is just it.  Polls show that 80% of Americans want factories to come back but 75% said they don’t want to work in them.  The levels of stupidity are beyond comprehension.,TubeframeMR2,2025-04-23T07:05:53,14
And the stupidity continues with them getting rid of the people that are willing to work in factories: immigrants.,theassassintherapist,2025-04-23T07:08:38,7
"Because you can't believe what those people say because you know they DO NOT understand what they are saying.   The customer is NOT always right but they will argue that they are.   Sure, they want manufacturing back. But they didn't say they are willing to tough it out for the next 10-20 years while that happens.  In other news, food banks have no food and China now has new export controls.  Trump cuts hit struggling food banks, risking hunger for low-income Americans   https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/03/25/food-banks-hit-by-trump-cuts-risking-hunger/82648137007/    China Just Turned Off U.S. Supplies Of Minerals Critical For Defense & Cleantech   https://cleantechnica.com/2025/04/05/china-just-turned-off-u-s-supplies-of-minerals-critical-for-defense-cleantech/   > What China did wasn’t a ban, at least not in name. They called it export licensing. Sounds like something a trade lawyer might actually be excited about. But make no mistake: this was a surgical strike. They didn’t need to say no. They just needed to say “maybe later” to the right set of paperwork. These licenses give Beijing control over not just where these materials go, but how fast they go, in what quantity, and to which politically convenient customers. >  > The U.S.? Let’s just say Washington should get comfortable waiting behind the rope line. The licenses have to be applied for and the end use including country of final destination must be clearly spelled out. Licenses for end uses in the U.S. are unlikely to be approved. What’s astonishing is how predictable this all was. China has spent decades building its dominance over these supply chains, while the U.S. was busy outsourcing, divesting, and cheerfully ignoring every report that said, “Hey, maybe 90% dependence on a single country we keep starting trade wars with and rattling sabers at is a bad idea.” >  > Try ramping up your semiconductor fab or solar plant when your indium source just dried up. It’s a fun exercise in learning which of your suppliers used to be dependent on Beijing but never mentioned it in the quarterly call. >  > The materials China just restricted aren’t random. They’re chosen with the precision of someone who’s read U.S. product spec sheets and defense procurement orders. Start with dysprosium. If your electric motor needs to function at high temperatures—and they all do—then mostly it is using neodymium magnets doped with dysprosium. No dysprosium, no thermal stability. No thermal stability, no functioning motor in your F-35 or your Mustang Mach-E. China controls essentially the entire supply of dysprosium, and no, there is no magical mine in Wyoming or Quebec waiting in the wings. If dysprosium doesn’t come out of China, it doesn’t come out at all. It’s the spinal cord of electrification, and right now China’s holding the vertebrae. >  > So here we are. China has responded to Trump’s tariffs by cutting off U.S. supply of some of the most essential ingredients of the modern world.",tech57,2025-04-23T08:20:07,1
