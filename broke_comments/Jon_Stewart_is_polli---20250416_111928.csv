I’m not sure why anyone would mock this. Is it really that much crazier than Trump running in 2016? I wouldn’t vote for Jon but he’s probably a better candidate than who dems will actually run.,SecretConservAccount,2025-04-16T12:01:27,1077
"He’s demonstrated deep commitment  to ideas & programs he holds dear.  I am wary to talk ill of a man who fought so tirelessly for 9/11 survivors and families.  I may not agree with Jon, but he’s someone worth talking & listening to.",JimLeahe,2025-04-16T17:34:46,271
"honestly, he's probably the best candidate they have so it's not surprising to see him polling well as a hypothetical primary candidate.  he's someone that actually cares about solving problems and will in good faith listen to our side and have a discussion. that's very different from many people on that side of the aisle.",reaper527,2025-04-16T11:35:02,420
"I feel like the only way forward for the Democrats is to have an outsider come in and shake things up, so he might do well.",RotoDog,2025-04-16T13:07:59,128
"The DNC has an iron grip over their party, sure there's all these hopefuls like Jon Stewart and AOC but I'd bet good money they'll go about business as usual and coronate someone like Newsom or Pritzker in 2028.",Rare_Cobalt,2025-04-16T12:36:11,75
"Semi-related: I remember I saw Dave Chappelle and Jon Stewart perform at Red Rocks in August 2019. Chappelle at one point started talking about how Jon should run for President in the upcoming election because everyone else sucked or whatever, and he got the whole audience to chant for Jon running too. I think he could be effective at campaigning, depending on how much of a grip the far-left has on the DNC come primary season. His O'Reily debates are instructive. I don't really know how much he really ""won"" any of those; but he vibed the winner pretty hard even if I think O’Reily was more correct. Then again, I see him being *much* more effective against Trump than Vance. Kamala was able to get under his skin with the rally size, imagine Stewart's trolling! Conversely, JD seems pretty great at handling that type of thing.",zVitiate,2025-04-16T11:53:37,68
I like Jon. He’s an honest man and I know he really cares about the country. That being said I definitely disagree with him on certain ways to help our country. I’ll still take him over any current Democrat,aethiestinafoxhole,2025-04-16T12:58:47,27
"I like Jon Stewart. I wouldn’t vote for him, but I could see how he could do well against other Democrats in the primaries and further get a lot of undecided voters.",I_hate_alot_a_lot,2025-04-16T15:10:52,39
"I doubt Stewart would go for it. But he could if he wanted to. He doesn’t get everything right, but his 2019 speech to Congress advocating for 9/11 first responders is one of the most moving political moments I’ve seen in years",PieIsFairlyDelicious,2025-04-16T15:10:49,8
Harris is the 2028 frontrunner lol,ChiefStrongbones,2025-04-16T20:55:05,5
"He’s polling at 3% lol. I’m surprised Harris is still polling so high, she was never a good candidate. I’m guessing this will all change once it’s time for primaries.",embracethef,2025-04-16T14:41:55,16
There is no way the Democratic establishment would allow Jon Stewart to win the nomination.  It would actually be tragically entertaining to witness the establishment media turn on JS so fast to manufacturer consent against his candidacy.,newgalactic,2025-04-16T17:54:52,10
To be fair he's a better pick than a lot of the names being floated around like AOC.,Merax75,2025-04-16T18:07:12,5
Oh great so is he gonna finally stop hiding behind the whole “I’m just a comedian” bit he does whenever he’s criticized.,Graardors-Dad,2025-04-16T13:49:46,2

He can't be worse that Kamala or Biden I guess. It's a pretty low bar to beat for the DNC right now.,Cobra__Commander,2025-04-19T00:10:10,1
I hope he runs. He could bring some sanity back to dems.,whippingboy4eva,2025-04-20T09:05:18,1
"He’s never run anything, correct? He’s only been a tv guy?",skarface6,2025-04-17T02:09:24,1
I agree with you. I wouldn’t vote for him either but he has a lot of charisma and a very large following with a well established platform. I would view him as a much stronger candidate than say AOC.,philthy069,2025-04-16T14:06:08,212
I always said John would be a decent dem candidate.....  But the CRAZY shit is dems just so fucken in the weeds theyre just nominating random people to run for 2028 who have no interest in running for president lol,CantSeeShit,2025-04-16T18:54:12,29
"The dems are so incredibly unpopular and have historically screwed the pooch so badly that something dramatic like this would be necessary if Trump doesn't totally wreck the country.  Jon is smart, he is likable, he is charismatic, and whether he does or not he at least seems like he cares about things.  He comes off as being genuine, probably because he is a comedian and actor.  But so are Whoopi, Colbert, and Kimmel and all three just come off as smug elitists.  Hairgel doesn't scare me, he seethes fake costal elite from his pores and it is apparent to everyone but him.  Some of the other dem governors scare me a little, but not enough.  Jon Stewart running on the heels of a failed Trump presidency and 12 straight years of media brainwashing with 4 straight years of protests and riots would scare the hell out of me.",Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-04-16T15:05:04,55
The reason to mock this is because polling this far out is just a Q score,MBBIBM,2025-04-16T16:30:51,8

"Nah, he’ll have an okay take here and there but has many more trash ones and doesn’t portray our actual ideas well at all.",skarface6,2025-04-17T02:10:00,2
"Why would he run though? Actually running for president is like working 3 full time jobs practically.  He makes a shit ton more money working one day a week bitching.  It's why people ask Ben Shapiro why doesn't he run for governor of Florida and he's like no chance.  He could likely easily win, but that's a shit ton more work for pennies on the dollar compared to what he does now.",global_ferret,2025-04-16T13:31:26,4
> will in good faith listen to our side and have a discussion.   He made a career off of presenting strawman versions of conservatives in bad faith.  ,hesdoneitagain,2025-04-16T13:09:08,-7

"They won’t allow it. Voters could chose him, but in the end the powers that be in the DNC will decide who they want, it’s their party. This is the position their argued in a previous lawsuit.",DS_9,2025-04-17T00:02:05,15
"I love his O’Rielly debates. Really wish they’d do a new one, although I’m really not sure where either of them sit on the party spectrum anymore.",iowaisflat,2025-04-16T16:02:50,3

At least Maher is less grating on the ears than Jon,PM_ME_UR_VSKA_EXPLOD,2025-04-16T16:04:59,1
"Jon is very genuine... I don't agree with him on a number of things, but the way he fought for 9/11 first responders needs a lot of respect no matter which side you're on. It's really a travesty it took so much effort to get them what they deserved.",swd120,2025-04-16T23:40:37,45
I don't agree with him on a lot of things but I think he's smart enough to avoid doing anything too stupid or insane.    I'm sort of just imagining his presidency being a fever dream version of the Daily Show live from the White House every week night. ,Cobra__Commander,2025-04-19T00:20:44,1
">	Nah, he’ll have an okay take here and there but has many more trash ones and doesn’t portray our actual ideas well at all.  Now compare that to anyone else who will seek the democratic nomination.",reaper527,2025-04-17T06:55:41,3
Pretty sure he’s gone on record before and said he wouldn’t ever want to run even though he knows people want him to.,MacadamiaMinded,2025-04-17T08:26:32,1
