">Twenty-Second Amendment Section 1 No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.

I think he legitimately intends to run in 2028. But he is also trying to distract from his awful handling of the economy which sits at 37 percent approval rating. And his inhumane treatment of those sent to el salvador.,paxwells97,2025-04-24T16:11:46,1

"Not necessarily a misdirection, but it is definitely propaganda. I think he's making absurd statements about breaking the Constitution to get us more and more accustomed to him trying to break the Constitution, up until he actually does it and we're just like ""Well that's Trump"".   The Kremlin does shit like this. There's a book call ""Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: The Surreal Heart of the New Russia"" where it talks about how the Kremlin is constantly flooding the media with absurd or contradictory stories. The goal is to confuse, exhaust, and demoralize the Russian population to the point to where they just accept anything Putin does with a shrug.",ThisOneFuqs,2025-04-24T17:24:05,1
