"If you’re a fan of public radio and television broadcasting, there may be some absolutely massive pledge drives coming your way, as the Trump White House is reportedly readying a plan to have Congress axe all federal funding for National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-15T16:04:52,230
"Great.  More telethons on PBS.  I have not watched in ages, but as a child of the 80s, I did enjoy the educational and science shows back in the day before things got too politicized.",bw2082,2025-04-15T14:49:58,152
"NPR is definitely more heavily biased than PBS, which is probably somewhat based on their formatting and audience. However, PBS has been heavily left leaning for decades. In the 1980s, they hosted Milton Friedman's Free to Choose Program, which was about free markets, capitalism, and limited government. They also hosted William F Buckley's 'Firing Line' which was an explicitly conservative talk show until the late 90s. Cant quite say the same for them now.   NPR has long had a liberal bent, but in the last 5-10 years it is almost universally progressive in its story selection, narration, argumentation, and host bias. Everything from DEI, post-colonial movements, BIPOCs, etc. Their coverage of Israel-Palestine has been particularly one-sided. Their response to the Hunter Biden laptop story really struck a nerve when they did an ""explainer"" on why they didnt cover the story and why they didnt focus on the media's shortcomings with hubris like ""Here's why we don't think this story is important.""    I dont think institutions like the media can be in the public domain because they are naturally susceptible to bias, audience capture, and ideplogical pretexts. I would also question the concept of a ""public"" audience because the country has become more divided and less cohesive as a consumer block. What they may consider a ""public good"" like transing the kids or DEI programs, many of us would strongly disagree with their take. ",milton1775,2025-04-15T17:12:54,64
I watch a lot of PBS and I'm ok with that.  Tax payer dollars shouldn't be funding openly political networks,Blown89,2025-04-16T03:38:44,19
"When I was a kid, the amount of Political news was only a few segments in news broadcasting. Now it's 24/7 everywhere you go, and if it's not political the topic always goes back to politicial. Like warehouse fire in downtown, find out how it's because of climate change and how Trump's policys caused it.   NPR is one of those 24/7 not fair or balanced broadcasting. I stopped listening when Car Talk and Priarie Home Companion went away.    Bring back real radio or just play music.",4thdegreeknight,2025-04-15T18:13:30,28
"If NPR changed it's name to New Progressive Radio they'd have to change none of their content at least... NPR should be the radio CSPAN, instead it's radio DNC. Should have been defunded a long time ago",NoVacancyHI,2025-04-15T14:50:30,22
"Cool.    Just like all fascists he's um... dismantling a ready-made propaganda arm?    Who thought a free nation should have state broadcasting anyway? Such a ridiculous concept.    PS. They never retracted their stories saying COVID came from bat soup, ice caps would be gone by 2000, Trump was a Russian plant, etc. so fuck em.",rasputin777,2025-04-15T17:58:15,5

"I'm happy to see NPR funding axed. It's so partisan and left leaning that I can't believe taxpayers have funded them to date.  PBS is alright, will be slightly sad to see them go, since they do put out decent programming.",T0XxXiXiTy,2025-04-15T18:37:17,3

"I guess I’ll have to add myself to the donor rolls then. I’m a big fan of PBS, especially the WGBH shows. To the extent you can even call them liberal it’s more of the ‘Massachusetts old money’ type than whatever the Democrats are today.  Frontline is probably the least partisan show there is. Not a fan of NPR though (except Tiny Desk Concerts).",zip117,2025-04-15T18:15:25,329
"I used to listen to NPR back in the day, and it always got under my skin when they claimed to be 'ad free'.  Like, ""We don't have ads! Now here's a list of our sponsor corporations, the services they provide, and their company slogans!""  Like 30 seconds once or twice an hour.  Then they have multi-day pledge drives a few times a year, where there's no content at all but fundraising junk all day long.",Ghosttwo,2025-04-15T22:39:42,7

"By the way, even though Garrison Keiller was a hard core liberal, I still enjoyed his show. It sucks how NPR fired him based on a claim that he touched a woman's back, this happened at the start of the Me Too movement and the movement needed examples. It was unfair and unjust for them to fire him from his show.",4thdegreeknight,2025-04-15T18:24:23,7

"NPR doesn't even try to pretend they're not overwhelmingly biased anymore.   There's some great PBS content. And even a few good NPR shows. But yeah, get the government out of funding it.

"For sure. That’s the best way of thinking about it, it’s not about whether they lean left or right but whether the government should be funding media organizations to begin with. If the educational content could be cleanly separated, there’s an argument for that.  On another note I was reading a story from NPR themselves this morning (I like to hear all sides), check this out: [Trump plans order to cut funding for NPR and PBS](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/15/nx-s1-5352827/npr-pbs-public-media-trump-rescission-funding)  > NPR receives about **1%** of its funding directly from the federal government, and a bit more indirectly; its 246 member institutions, operating more than 1,300 stations, receive on average 8% to 10% of their funds from CPB. In turn, they pay NPR to air its national shows. By contrast, PBS and its stations receive about **15%** of their revenues from CPB.  I’ll admit, I was under the impression that they got a whole lot more funding from CPB. They will manage.",zip117,2025-04-16T07:01:19,9
"I listen some during my commute. It's good radio but obviously skewed left. But they've actually scaled back on some of the overt wokeness, I've noticed. At one point about 8 out of 10 stories had a gender/minority angle even when it had nothing to do with the issue. It was exhausting. I'm just not hearing as much of it anymore.",Hideous__Strength,2025-04-16T06:58:03,11
"I don’t think so. They are the only program to make the original, unedited interview content available so the public can verify it was presented without bias. Imagine 60 Minutes doing something like that on their own volition. The FCC had to force CBS to release the original video and transcripts from the interview with Kamala Harris.

"Yeah, it’s kind of where I’m conflicted since in the interest of small government I’m not sure they should be getting this much federal funding, but they’ve produced so much good content over the years. Hopefully private contributions will be enough to keep some of it going if this goes through.",zip117,2025-04-15T22:30:37,6

"It's a bit of a shell game.   The member stations get a lot of direct and indirect federal and state tax money, and they pay affiliate fees and programming fees to NPR. Those fees paid to NPR account for about a third of NPR's budget, last article I saw about it.   It's basically the same mechanism as money laundering, where the money goes through a number of intermediaries before getting to its final destination.",TexasPeteEnthusiast,2025-04-16T10:58:39,5

"I really don’t see it. I watched their most recent political documentary [Trump’s Comeback](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/documentary/trumps-comeback/) for the second time last night and it comes across as pretty even-handed to me. You can find a half-dozen statements that are pro-Trump and another half-dozen of the opposite, and that documentary gets as much criticism from the left as it does from the right. I think that people are so used to partisan media that they don’t recognize what unbiased coverage looks like, and they laser focus on statements that fit their own biases.  If you can point me to one of their films that you think has a huge bias, I’m happy to watch it and reconsider.",zip117,2025-04-16T07:51:51,3
