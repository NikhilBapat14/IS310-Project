"Happy Easter!  …it does suck being the only one in the household who’s first awake on Easter, though. I miss my childhood Easter days, waking up to baskets of candy and whatever the bunny decided to throw in there too. If only I could turn back time…",Ok-Willow-4232,2025-04-20T07:15:33,104

"I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten Son of God, born of the Father before all ages. God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father; through him all things were made. For us men and for our salvation he came down from heaven, and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary, and became man. For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate, he suffered death and was buried, and rose again on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures. He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead and his kingdom will have no end. Amen.

"Happy Easter, it boggles my mind how bothered by Easter Sunday so many of the protesting gang are. When asking them why it bothers them so much they talk of worshipping fictional characters.   I always say no one worships the Easter Bunny. The spittle usually follows as their disgust with religion ensues.  It’s apparent these people don’t like to think they may be held accountable or have to have a life review.",Bitter-Assignment464,2025-04-20T08:18:14,-21

"I like to celebrate Lazarus's resurrection, personally. (John 11:38). Sometimes that guy at Nain (Like 7:14), or Jairus's little girl (Mark 5:41)? She was first, if you don't count all those OT people. Also Peter resurrected that lady in Joppa (Acts 9:40). I feel like that's even cooler, tbh... usually god has to do it, but I guess he can outsource resurrections?  Honestly I'm pretty stoked that we all get resurrected after a while (Revelations 20:5). That'll be cool.",DeadbaseXI,2025-04-20T08:56:38,-1

"My kids are old enough that they all know about the Easter Bunny as of last year so I’m off the hook for it this year.  We still did the full thing - hiding eggs, baskets, etc. The one thing I told them was to let me sleep in since this is one of my few opportunities to sleep in as late as I want.  So at 6:30 this morning I hear “**SHHHHHHH, DON’T GO IN! CLOSE THE DOOR!  HE WANTS TO SLEEP!!!!**”",EC_TWD,2025-04-20T16:11:58,4
