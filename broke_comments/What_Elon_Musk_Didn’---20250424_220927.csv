"I've lived around Silicon  Valley over 28 years, all in high tech- start ups, large corps, SaaS, etc.  great years/ shitty years.   Very few real leaders exist in tech companies- most of the top tech execs. VCs are truly awful peoole with bankrupt soulswho do not care about the human race other than their own tribe of billionaires.   It's interesting to see the reactions from mainstream society -US and beyond to get their first taste of these grotesque pigs.   Money- in and of itself- was never super interesting to me, maybe because I come from several generations of privilege.   I would honestly be perplexed about what to do with $1b or anything over 100m... Honestly like WTF would you do with that?   Not so Googly anymore now is it?  Veil is off",goderdammurang,2025-04-24T22:40:24,1

" The good thing is if the people being targeted win they will likely get back paid without having to do any actual work during that period, and could be paid additional compensation if they win through the courts for the emotional and mental harm done to them.  Courts can also order for immediate reinstatement and if you win against the US government they are unlikely to ever fuck with you again as it could be seen as retaliation.  Ironically since they went the illegal route to try to fire a bunch of people they may end up losing and being stuck with a bunch of employeeâ€™s who are near invincible to any future actions against them as retaliation becomes a criminal issue.  If they would have just gone through the legal route with a RIF none of this would have happened. They donâ€™t even have to give a probie severance or admin pay leave if they RIF them.",Deep_Alps7150,2025-04-24T22:42:31,1
