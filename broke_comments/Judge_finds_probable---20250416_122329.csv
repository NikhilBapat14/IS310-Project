"My federal judiciary powers allow me to order any separate sovereign nation to do anything i want regarding their own citizensâ€¦.  Cool maybe he can order russia to end the war, or the iranians to not execute thousands, or the chinese to not detain uighurs in slave camps.   Use your all encompassing global federal judge/emperor of the world powers for good, bosaberg! Maybe order and end to world hunger?!!!",PK275,2025-04-16T12:42:07,143
"This is going to backfire badly for this judge.    * First, I'd expect the DOJ to decline to prosecute. * Next, it isn't going to have any impact on Trump. * In ignoring SCOTUS' opportunities to walk things back a bit, he's harming the dignity and credibility of the judiciary. * It may well prove the pivot issue that gives *larger* margins to Republicans in Congress.   * If the above happens, you can be certain there will be legislation that will regulate the authority of district judges.  The administration picked this as the line in the sand for a reason.",Celebril63,2025-04-16T12:30:42,116

Can we please impeach this pompous jackass?? All he is doing is obstructing our duly elected president and putting our national security in jeopardy.,Wolf687,2025-04-16T19:10:39,4
I hold this judge in contempt for being a jackass.,freeyare,2025-04-16T16:53:08,6

"> The Trump administration has argued it did not violate any orders, noted the judge did not include the turnaround directive in his written order and said the planes had already left the U.S. by the time that order came down.

"If ""sue and settle"" isn't an illegal practice, then the Judiciary can't demand a specific level of activity for other executive actions simply for political grandstanding.   https://www.uschamber.com/regulations/sue-and-settle-regulating-behind-closed-doors",ngoni,2025-04-17T11:21:34,1
"\> Cool maybe he can order russia to end the war, or the iranians to not execute thousands, or the chinese to not detain uighurs in slave camps.  But that's kind of how they (the left) think, no? That just saying / willing things will actually make them happen. A lot of how things *ought to be* and therefore *should be* and therefore simply *is*.",zVitiate,2025-04-16T15:24:30,13
"In another (supposedly) pro-Trump site, I made a sarcastic comment about this judge ordering a military extraction.  You wouldn't believe the nitpicking and attacks it got from the leftist brigadiers.  All in the name of what is sufficient attempts to ""facilitate.""  Watching as this story develops, though, my comment was well deserved.",Celebril63,2025-04-16T13:01:41,2
It's just the same lawfare from 2021 - 2024 all over again. Guess they didn't learn from their 4 years of failures but that isn't surprising.,Rare_Cobalt,2025-04-16T12:33:01,60
">If the above happens, you can be certain there will be legislation that will regulate the authority of district judges.  Agree, it's already happening, in a sense.  A nationwide injunction is - in a sense - like a nationwide legislation.  That should not happen, as Senator Kennedy said, these types of cases Trump is generating should be more akin to class action lawsuits.",GiediOne,2025-04-16T12:39:10,24
