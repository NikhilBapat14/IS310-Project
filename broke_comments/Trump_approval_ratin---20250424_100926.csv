He’s more popular than ever amongst his base. This means nothing. It’s time to stop with the delusion that somehow people are going to change their mind about this. They are “winning” and not tired of it yet.   This idea that he’s becoming unpopular or something is absolute hogwash.  Besides-  why does popularity matter? He’s going to continue to do absolutely whatever he wants- and nobody is going to do anything about it. If he wanted a third term; he’d just stay in the White House. While people complained and judges handed down court orders to be ignored. Nobody is going to do a damned thing about any of it. All just paper tigers.,Zoxpan,2025-04-24T16:54:08,1

"I've been going through this with my mother. What has worked best for me is leading with emotion, leave the logic for after you get your foot in the door. Start with stuff like:  \- ""I hate the Dems too, maybe even more than you!"" \*  \- ""Less corruption in government is a noble goal, no one disagrees with that, but I don't trust the conman with a literal gold toilet or the richest man in the world to do that.""  \- ""It's called ***DOGE***!""  \- ""We're becoming a laughing stock on the world stage. We've become weak and unreliable in the eyes of our closest allies. Repairing our reputation at this point could take generations.""  \- ""Mainstream Media is owned by billionaires with agendas, I don't trust them either!"" \*  \- ""He wants to gut social security. I'm not getting anything from that, and wouldn't for decades. I'm worried ***for you***.""

Then they'll deflect or blame someone else for all the chaos Trump causes. I really hate this time line. In any sane world, he would have been laughed off the stage in the early primaries in 16'.

"To be fair, I kind of understand the apathy that 1/3 of American’s have about politics. If you’re lower middle class, you have too much money to receive government benefits, but not enough to get ahead through investing, networking, schooling, etc. They’ve seen that nothing the government does benefits them and just maintains the status quo, so why even bother choosing a side?  Of course, that apathy can bite you in the ass when the rest of the populace elects a leader that will make everyone but the 1% worse off.   America is very much a “I got mine” mentality. The government is there to prop up business and the elites with life-saving support only to the lower class. Your retirement, your healthcare, your PTO, are for the most part all dependent on who your employer is and how the economy is doing.   It’s amazing to me that with a country so “wealthy,” so little of it actually goes to improving the lives of people through social programs like childcare, healthcare, retirement, higher education, etc. If money truly equaled happiness, we’d be thriving. However, we are continually left off of the top of those lists in this “land of the free.”",Drift_Life,2025-04-24T12:09:34,7

"What you are saying is exactly correct. The left focuses on social safety net programs that most people don’t qualify for and don’t want to qualify for, while the right focuses on deregulation that tends to benefit people who are much wealthier than than the average person. No one advocates for the middle 75% of Americans. It just so happens that it’s a lot easier for the right to convince those people that they could one day be very rich than it is for the left to convince them that they could become very poor, altogether the latter is statistically astronomically more likely.   One thing I did appreciate about the Biden administration is that they seemed to be making policies designed to help that middle 75%, with, for example, regulations either forcing the disclosure of junk fees, or just banning them outright. They also attempted to tackle student loan debt, which if reduced would greatly benefit our economy while being harmful to a small number of individual multi-millionaires such as Betsy Devos. They tried to address predatory business practices, and many other similar reforms aimed at benefiting everyday people.",Menanders-Bust,2025-04-24T17:33:10,1

"The main issue for you i think, is that you believe we are nearing a bottoming out.   Wherein i think we are no where near that level. If we were at that point, Trump would never have been elected or allowed to run as a convicted felon. He would have already been impeached even with his actions 3 months in. Worse still, Who will the American people elect next? Trump is not a blimp, but a reckoning. This has been a 4 decades-long disinformation campaign that has infested the minds of the average American. Trump is result of that. I learned over the course of 3 elections that the typical American now is greedy, self-centered, ignorant and short-sighted.  Republicans and Independents love him.  Even enough Democrats stayed home last election despite Trump as a threat to show how little the average American cares. How the hell does *he* get the popular vote?! There are those who believe MAGA make up 30-40% of the population too. That should tell you how bad it has become and how much worse it will get over the next few decades.
