"Secretary of State **Marco Rubio** has *announced* the first stage of a major overhaul of the U.S. State Department, eliminating **132 domestic offices** and ***cutting*** around **700 positions** in Washington, D.C. The reorganization aims to reduce bureaucracy and realign the department’s structure with the Trump administration’s priorities, while shifting responsibilities and closing offices focused on war crimes, conflict, and humanitarian issues. Congress has been notified, with reactions divided along party lines.",brendigio,2025-04-22T14:40:16,5

"> closing offices focused on war crimes, conflict, and humanitarian issues...   Might as well, we have a long history of not doing anything about it anyhow... And if we did we'd mostly be investigating ourselves or our biggest allies.   The difference between our nation and the ideals we purport to stand for is about 180°.  Like spreading democracy at the point of a gun.",Electric_Banana_6969,2025-04-22T14:51:18,0
