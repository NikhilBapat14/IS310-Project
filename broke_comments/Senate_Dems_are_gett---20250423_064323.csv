"Excellent news. On a side note, I think Gov Beshear (Ky) is one they may want to consider recruiting too. Only if he can’t make traction on the executive front.",IndianaGunner,2025-04-23T07:07:32,23

Let’s not forget Sherrod Brown in Ohio. He performed 7 points better than Harris in the state. He is still really popular and could potentially flip the seat back.,Done327,2025-04-23T09:26:35,12
He should def run for McConnell’s seat. Unless people who know better than me think it is a waste of talent! If he wins mcconnells seat it would not preclude him from a White House run. But he is not well known enough at this point for a White House run.,Cluefuljewel,2025-04-23T14:33:04,4
"He is liked quite a bit in our region and I think a group of us dems/moderates in Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, WV, and TN would vote Presidential for him and he could pull some western NC and Southern Missouri dems/moderate votes too. It could make it interesting. He may have a hard time in the northern rust belt though.",IndianaGunner,2025-04-23T17:02:39,2
I like him a lot!,Cluefuljewel,2025-04-23T22:23:09,1
