So when will the cases be heard?  Or are we gonna keep hearing about cases that never go to court?,Nateleb1234,2025-04-23T19:54:45,2
Today the Wall Street Journal reported that he is walking back his tariff proposals quite dramatically. He has clearly failed to convince anyone that these tariffs were a good idea and there are a lot of billionaire CEOs right now that are pissed at him.   But now he's climbing down from his worse tariff proposals.   **This is not necessarily a good thing**     Of all the things that Trump has done his tariffs and economic damage are the ones that have affected the most ordinary people. The tariffs have gotten more people on the anti-Trump bandwagon than anything else. All of his human rights violations and attacks on colleges and universities and science and environmental cuts have not made as many people mad as his tariffs.    ,Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-23T18:01:47,3
