"You may find [this paper](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2023/09/polarization-democracy-and-political-violence-in-the-united-states-what-the-research-says?lang=en) by Kleinfeld at Carnegie (2023) an interesting read.  Some quotes:  **American voters are less ideologically polarized than they think they are, and that misperception is greatest for the most politically engaged people**.   However, most partisans hold major misbeliefs about the other party’s preferences that lead them to think there is far less shared policy belief. This perception gap is highest among progressive activists, followed closely by extreme conservatives: in other words, the people who are most involved in civic and political life hold the least accurate views of the other side’s beliefs. Figure 1 shows the gap between what groups of Americans think the other side believes and what they self-report believing, as of 2019.  **American politicians are highly ideologically polarized. In other words, they believe in and vote for different sets of policies, with little overlap. This trend has grown in a steady, unpunctuated manner for decades.**   One reason that the most highly politically engaged Americans may misunderstand the other side is that they correctly estimate the extreme ideological polarization among politicians.   While at this point, candidates and parties may be responding to polarized primary voters, candidates and parties have been driving the polarization, and not all voters are ideologically polarized.   The disparity between where leaders are ideologically and where their voters are precludes legislative policy agreement on many issues. Average voters are not able to assert their (often weak) policy preferences because they do not have an effective way to vote out representatives who do not accurately represent their constituents’ views, particularly on the right where party chairs are likely to substitute one extreme candidate for another.  **Even though Americans are not as ideologically polarized as they believe themselves to be, they** ***are*** **emotionally polarized (known as “affective polarization”). In other words, they do not like members of the other party.**   Americans harbor strong dislike for members of the other party (though they also dislike their own parties, as well). While social media is often blamed for this phenomenon, affective polarization started growing before the internet: its onset more closely correlates with the rise of cable news and radio talk shows.  **Similarly, affective polarization is not causing political violence directly. It is probably contributing to an environment that allows politicians and opinion leaders to increase violence targeted at politicians, election officials, women, and many types of minorities.**   Affective polarization in the United States has been rising for decades, while political violence only increased sharply in 2016. Affective polarization is also quite symmetrical across parties, while political violence is overwhelmingly from the right. This suggests that emotional feelings of hatred toward members of the other party are not a primary cause of political violence. ",PoliticalAnimalIsOwl,2025-01-05T16:47:14,16
"Honestly, yeah most people are moderates, and its just the media/ others trying to control the narrative. The people who are the most extreme are usually also the loudest and most hypocritical.   I'm 100% sure that if you talked with the average person about where they stand on various right/left leaning talking points or policies, they'd agree to a point or at least have a more nuanced view on things. No one really fits into these little boxes that we've made when it comes to political views.  https://www.google.com/",Lopsided_Republic888,2025-01-05T13:16:24,9
"There is no virtual difference between our parties. They are both focused on enriching the wealthy.  Noam Chomsky has my favorite description in “manufacturing consent”. The ‘differences’ are cosmetic at best. I mean this was true for a long time.   Clinton was right wing in most areas just not powered by extreme hate.  This is not both sides are the same. I guess it is how much fuels them and hence one ‘side’ is not equal. Unfortunately hate and fear are easier to sell once the guidelines for reality are removed.  It is depressing that we have to suffer through this but we had RAYGUN, bush, W, and drumph. I still want to flee",carminemangione,2025-01-06T18:53:02,4
I’m realizing that the real “woke” is refuting this smokescreen of a culture war that our politicians are forcing us to participate in.,Gman3098,2025-01-08T15:09:44,1
"> its just the media/ others trying to control the narrative.  It's worth mentioning that if you have some outcome you want to push people toward, making them believe that there is a problem in the status quo is the first step. It's not entirely different than a sales pitch; you have to create some sort of discomfort.",jkovach89,2025-01-05T23:04:39,2

This is such a good point. My so is military and we have socialized medicine. With 3 kids including one with epilepsy (fortunately a kind that can be outgrown) I realized what we had was obviously superior than the for profit mess that made Bri an  Tho mpson so universally loathed his 💀 was celebrated like the ewoks watching the death star explode at the end of RotJ. It's just that the connection between class and politics has been so obfuscated by every institution in the country. ,Inner-Mechanic,2025-01-11T09:34:58,1
"but most moderates vote for ppl who say they are moderates but are not.  That is, most moderate don't believe the US should take militant positions, spend half are budget on the military, violate the right to citizens privacy ,and not address poverty.

">My so is military and we have socialized medicine. With 3 kids including one with epilepsy (fortunately a kind that can be outgrown) I realized what we had was obviously superior than the for profit mess  Honestly, military medicine and Tricare as a whole is kind of a mixed bag (I'm actice army), trying to file claims throguh tricare overseas is a pain, for example my wife got some vaccines done and I filled out a form that's required for the claim. I couldn't actually submit the claim without attaching that form, so I attached it any everything else required. Come to find out that somehow the claim was missing the form (that I attached), and there was no messages from Tricare saying the claim was missing the form, so they wound up denying the claim.  Tricare and military medicine also have the problem of being slow inefficient messes, and previously if a military surgeon or doctor messed up, they couldn't be sued for malpractice. They wouldn't have had any serious repercussions professionally, and would have been allowed to keep practicing. Tricare is also farmed out to private health insurance companies, and its a slow process when filing claims 30 days minimum for a simple claim like mine).   In addition to that there's sometimes major problems like the dual military couple at Ft. Liberty who got sent to a civilian hospital for the birth of their baby, they did everything they were supposed to do, and wound up with a $60,000 hospital bill that Tricare wasn't going to pay, it took them going onto reddit and having the **Sergeant Major of The Army** get personally involved to help them and get everything sorted.  The former CEO of United Healthcare was so universally hated because his policy decisions made millions of Americans health insurance more expensive, and provide less coverage than ever before. Did he deserve what happened? No hr didn't, but I understood the anger and why he was targeted.",Lopsided_Republic888,2025-01-11T11:02:29,1
">but most moderates vote for ppl who say they are moderates but are not.  I'd be interested to see what statistics you have to support this, but for the average American, most people are willing to listen to and control people who they don't agree with politically. I'm not talking about politicians because if I got told by one that the sky was blue, I'd look to make sure it really was.    >That is, most moderate don't believe the US should take militant positions, spend half are budget on the military, violate the right to citizens privacy ,and not address poverty.  The first point is definitely true, however, most Americans don't understand the legislation/ policy decisions our government makes, this is partially from apathy, partially from ignorance, and other factors as well.  The second point is definitely true, however the US doesn't spend anywhere near as much as you claim on national defese, actually about 13% in FY 23, for a total of $820 bn for all defense activities. $776 bn was spent on military activities (DoD), and $43 bn was spent on other agencies.   The majority of the DoD budget went to operations and maintenance for a total of $318 bn (40.4% of the budget), and $184 bn went to personnel (pay, healthcare for servicemembers and dependents, retirement and disability pay) and associated expenses (23.77% of the budget).  Source:https://www.pgpf.org/article/budget-explainer-national-defense/  The third point you made, definitely depends on how you ask how people feel about government surveillance programs, like PRISM, Five Eyes, etc. Hell most people don't actually know what the Patriot Act actually covers, and no one really knows about the REAL ID system. Lots of these programs/policies have really sleek messaging to make them sound less invasive. The biggest thing with this is ignorance, apathy, messaging, and obscurity of these programs/policies/ laws. When was the last time you read the full Patriot Act legislation and understood every aspect of it, or read through all of the legislation that it affects?  The fourth point is true, and most politicians do have some blurb or policy positions that they believe will address poverty in the US, the problem is realizing these policies, and having them be effective.  >The don't believe politicians should only give tax breaks to the wealthy, engage in do nothing incrementalitst policies and break all of their promises.  These are all good points that a vast majority of Americans agree with, but when you have the current political climate we have of adversarial politics and the ""I got mine"" attitudes of politicians that's what you get. Keep in mind most Americans don't understand how our electoral systems work, and don't understand the whole process of legislation and how it becomes law. Most people don't actually try to hold elected officials accountable, most Americans only care about politics every 2,4, or 6 years. When was the last time you went to a townhall/ city council meeting where you live? When was the last time you went to a a Republicans or Democrats of Somewhereville meeting?   As a whole, most Americans aren't active politically, most American don't have the money, time, or energy to be politically active/literate/informed. That's what the two parties love, because they can keep saying we're gonna fight for Bibles in schools or we're gonna fight for Universal Basic income, and we get the same stuff we've had for over 200 years. Its up to Americans to educate themselves and to be literate and informed on politcs.",Lopsided_Republic888,2025-01-11T21:38:45,1
"Honestly, when you take emotions out of politics, and start looking for common ground, that's when you can start solving problems multiple people agree on. I'd be willing to bet that if you had two people with different views on national security, both of them would agree that the Patriot Act is excessive and invades the privacy of citizens to a disturbing degree once you actually walked them through it.",Lopsided_Republic888,2025-01-13T10:44:58,1
