Yeah good luck - Trump already told his El Salvadoran homeboy not to let him out and SCOTUS is too cowardly to hold him in contempt.,dinosaurinchinastore,2025-04-15T15:34:50,6

Good luck. These guys play the same game. Trump and his buddy in El Salvador both used executive powers to squash constitutional rights.,Flat-Emergency4891,2025-04-15T20:35:43,3

"If Trump or anyone in his administration is held in contempt by the Supreme or any other federal court, the judge makes an order and sends it to the U.S. Marshall service to arrest the person. The U.S. Marshall service does not report to the Supreme Court--It is part of the Executive Branch Department of Justice.   So if the Supreme Court issues an arrest warrant, it's up to Attorney General Pam Bondi to enforce it. You can see how that might be a problem. Hence, constitutional crisis.",TheStarterScreenplay,2025-04-15T14:45:15,12
"> I think I already know the answer but could Trump be held in contempt by the Supreme Court?  The same Supreme Court that gave him the extraordinary powers to do some of the crazy shit he's doing, like asking his Attorney General to open an investigation of a private citizen based on nothing more than his asking for it?",appmanga,2025-04-15T14:00:29,9

I like how we have a trillion dollar military but are like “welp El Salvador says no oh well”,raustin33,2025-04-15T15:36:00,7
I think he's alive but they never want him placed in front of a camera. And they know at this point if Garcia did come back he'd basically have a media tour.,destinyeeeee,2025-04-15T12:20:26,12
