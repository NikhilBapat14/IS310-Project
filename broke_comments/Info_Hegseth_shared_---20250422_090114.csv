"I've noticed how Whisky Pete, Baghdad Barbie Karoline Leavitt and undead ghoul Stephen Miller all constantly yell and get histrionic in their media appearances. They are all hysterical, in the sense of ""unable to control their emotions or behavior."" This shows stunted personalities.",oculeers,2025-04-22T09:17:13,12
"How is Hegseth supposed to be a White Nationalist and supremacist BUT...  - He's an moron - He's an alcoholic - He's a cheater  - Nobody at the Pentagon respects him  - He's a DEI hire at Fox News - Bleeding heart Warhawk for intelligence security BUT has had TWO information leaks in barely 3 months - Shares military plans with his fucking WIFE, a Fox News producer, his brother and his *personal* lawyer 😐.  On his personal phone via Signal chat because clearly he's doing grimy shit. - Needed his mommy to vouch for him to get the job, the one he said he'd stop drinking for IF they gave it to him - Needed an emergency $167K to paint his fucking house - Denounces his Ivy League education yet he's grossly under qualified to be a Fox News analyst or Defense Secretary.    Seriously, Rick Wilson said it best: he's a fucking frat bro party bro.  Even when called out for being a fuck up, he went on some weirdo tangent about fake news and fake media (yet he came from the biggest faux news propaganda network who paid $787M to Dominion for fucking LYING).  You can't make this shit up.  All these rubber faced motherfuckers talk out of both sides of their necks.  And this slick haired beady-eyed clown should not be anywhere NEAR the military, media or a church. I don't give a fuck HOW many tattoos he gets.  ",DragonWarrior980,2025-04-22T09:55:19,10
"A drunk, white supremacist and a constant security leak. Almost like everyone with greater than two brain cells said he was wildly unqualified. The dude who doesn’t wash his hands from Fox and friends because “germs aren’t real because I can’t see them”…",sadetheruiner,2025-04-22T09:14:11,7
">Hegseth this morning doubled down on his argument that he didn't do anything wrong in the second Signal chat involving military plans in Yemen that was revealed this week.  >""What was shared over Signal, then and now, however you characterize it, was informal, unclassified coordinations for media coordination, other things. That’s what I’ve said from the beginning,"" he said in an interview on Fox News.  >Hegseth said that he takes the classification of information seriously and it's important to safeguard it. He again pushed the idea that the new reporting about the second Signal chat was improperly disclosed to the media by former employees who are ""attempting to leak and sabotage the president's agenda and what we're doing.""  >Hegseth argues he didn't do anything wrong in second Signal chat, continued ""Everything we do here is aboveboard,"" he said. ""We're for the war fighters. We're for the president and none of this is based in reality.""  >The defense secretary, who didn't directly deny that he shared the sensitive information with his wife and his brother, said that the leak investigation into the former employees is ongoing. He said that once evidence is sufficiently gathered, it will be handed over to the Justice Department ""and those people will be prosecuted if necessary.""",jackytheblade,2025-04-22T09:18:22,5
"This is a pointless story.   Trump has incompetence or evil loyalty at every level of the cabinet. There is an anti vaxxer in charge of the health of every single one of us, including our children. 100 percent of republicans voted for 100 percent of this cabinet.   There is no reason to think that anyone but a similarly evil incompetent will replace Hegseth and there is no reason to think republicans won't stand up and clap for whoever dear leader decides to disgrace the office again.   So there is no reason to advocate in this story one way or another. The damage is done and irreversible. Republicans already disgraced their own offices and can never undo this",PayTheTeller,2025-04-22T09:48:34,2
Hey chat are we compromised on a global scale? Couldn’t be foreign attacks from the inside? Couldn’t be our system and tech vulnerabilities? I wonder what  in the world is going on in the House of Commons ? 🥴,hom1n1f0rm3ribbIT,2025-04-22T10:46:12,2

Remember when Kavanaugh did this during the confirmation hearings?  Lindsey Graham too.  Both after talking to Trump.  Its a right wing pattern.  Confront them and they go all brain stem to get you to engage your level of empathy which they lack. They use your tolerance against you.,TintedApostle,2025-04-22T09:25:37,13
