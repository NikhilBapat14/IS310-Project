It’s unfathomable to me how a government which ignores and actively mocks the rule of law and the legal rulings of the nation’s highest courts can hold itself out as tough on crime. How can they hold themselves out as protecting people from lawbreakers and illegal activities when they themselves are lawbreakers and actively engage in illegal activities. They are literally the lawbreakers they claim to be protecting the citizens from.,Newleafto,2025-04-24T17:43:51,1

That's the lie they tell to the rubes of the country to keep getting their dirty politicians voted back in. They know it's all a sham and laugh about how the rubes keep falling for it.,LurksAroundHere,2025-04-24T20:16:31,1

"I think we have to prepare for that eventuality. His presidency has thus far been unprecedented for a functioning democracy and, alarmingly, rather typical for a dictatorship going through the initial steps of overthrowing a democracy. First they replace all the generals and key government officials with incompetent sycophantic loyalists (check), then they cow the media by attempting to discredit them (check), then they cow the opposition rendering them ineffective (the democrats basically checked themselves), then they refuse to obey the courts and try to replace (or remove) judges (work in progress). There are more steps (jailing journalists and politicians etc), but there is a pattern of behaviour here which should be ringing alarm bells.",Newleafto,2025-04-24T18:52:25,1
