"For people not understanding how this works, and how it only benefits the rich: the money is not nearly enough to attend a private school, which means it is just free money for people who can already afford private school. It benefits no one except rich people, in a place (Texas) where tax laws screw everyone except the rich.",canzicrans,2025-04-24T20:00:41,1
Feel bad for the kids who go to school in that wretched state. Plans like this will only hurt poor and disenfranchised students.   On the bright side Texas will be blue eventually.,smalltownlargefry,2025-04-24T19:57:17,1

"> ""School choice has come to Texas,” said Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a Republican who controls the Senate who has pushed for a voucher program for nearly 20 years.  Christian nationalist West Texas billionaires Tim Dunn and Farris Wilks have been trying to get school vouchers passed for decades. Patrick is one of their puppets. Wilks & Dunn had to take over the Texas GOP using brute force to do it, but they finally got it passed.  Houston Chronicle - [Two oil tycoons are spending millions to gut Texas public education](https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Texas-Ted-Cruz-Tim-Nunn-Farris-Wilks-PAC-money-17327660.php)  “‘The goal is to tear up, tear down public education to nothing and rebuild it,’ Dororthy Burton, a former GOP activist who joined Wilks on a 2015 speaking tour, told CNN. ‘And rebuild it the way God intended education to be.’”  Texas Monthly - [The Campaign to Sabotage Texas’s Public Schools](https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/campaign-to-sabotage-texas-public-schools/)  “But by far the most powerful opponents of public schools in the state are West Texas oil billionaires Tim Dunn and the brothers Farris and Dan Wilks. Their vast political donations have made them the de facto owners of many Republican members of the Texas Legislature.”  YouTube - [James Talarico Condemns Christian Nationalism at the Texas Democratic Convention](https://youtu.be/Atj03AXtV8U) (3:28)  “We've talked about how Greg Abbott is defunding our public schools, but I don't want to get off this stage until I call out those two West Texas billionaires who are pulling the strings behind the scenes.   Their names are Tim Dunn and Farris Wilks.”  “I believe that people of faith and Christians in particular - including me -  have a moral obligation to speak out against this perversion of our faith and the subversion of our democracy.”",Arrmadillo,2025-04-24T20:27:37,1
Isn’t this the group always talking about indoctrination? Seems kinda weird that they want to control the narrative of the schools that kids are going to? We will pay but only if you pray! And if you sign up for the 5k baby scholarship trump is offering? You don’t even have to graduate high school.,nopulsehere,2025-04-24T20:05:00,1

This is going to go as well as the Kansas experiment did.  In 5 years when rural Texans are wondering why the fuck their school has to lay off half their staff the answer will be easy.,awildstoryteller,2025-04-24T20:44:02,1

We will have idiots raising idiots because they want to keep the $ to home school their kids.  Then the public school gets screwed because they are still held accountable for the standardized testing for those homeschooled students.

It won't even get that far tbh. In a decade Texas will be populated by multiple generations who were never taught critical thinking skills in school because the state decided that might offend mommy and daddy. It's as lost as a cause can be.,Beneficial_Soup3699,2025-04-24T20:59:06,1

So many people I know that are drowning in student debt could afford houses, kids, vacations, consumer spending, stocks etc. They’re paying an insane amount for the same degrees Boomers got for a song and a firm handshake.",bubblebath_ofentropy,2025-04-24T20:51:54,1
