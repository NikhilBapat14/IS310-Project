">The conservative justice Amy Coney Barrett pushed back on the idea that the books were merely exposing children to diverse communities and ideas. >“It’s presentation of the idea as fact – that’s different, right?” Barrett asked a lawyer for the school board, Alan Schoenfeld. >“It’s saying: ‘This is the right view of the world. This is how we think about things. This is how you should think about things,’” Barrett added.  Could you not make the same argument about heteronormative material?",hitman2218,2025-04-22T19:53:30,5

It’s not even overtly religious or conservative. It’s just stuff we grew up thinking was normal.,hitman2218,2025-04-22T20:45:46,1
That doesn't make it any less discriminatory.,PhoenixTineldyer,2025-04-22T22:18:17,1
