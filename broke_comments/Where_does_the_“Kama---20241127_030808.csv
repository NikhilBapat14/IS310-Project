"The claim in the ad was so outlandish, Erin Burnett (CNN) [couldn't believe](https://youtu.be/izygFgh86ak?si=icsM0VSURcocYoih) Kamala actually said that.   Taxpayer funded trans surgeries for illegal immigrants in prison. Can you get more buzz words in a single sentence??   But what made that ad work, was the closing. ""She's for they / them. Trump is for you."" Then having Trump endorse the message... that's strong. That turn of words moved the focus from the absurd, to Trump's top campaign message: he's for you.",skins_team,2024-11-27T11:04:10,44

"So there's no actual evidence that ad swayed that many people.   In October, [a plurality of polled voters (42%)](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25252151/cnn-poll-on-2024-presidential-race.pdf) stated they had no strong opinions one way or the other on trans issues. That was after the Republican campaign placed about $100 million dollars down on vehemently anti-trans ads.  In November - after the election - voter attitudes switched to [a plurality (43%)](https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2024/11/21/dddbb/3), but only when the answer mentioned ""upholding traditional definitions of gender."" The particular problem there is I don't really like how that answer is worded - transgender people are not some kind of special third gender. They just identify as male or female. Nonetheless I think most people who answer 'yes' to that would be nominally anti-trans in some way.  Pretty much all the polling illustrating anti-trans attitudes among Independent voters comes after the election already occurred - so a early-to-late November timeframe. Prior to that, support splits relatively neatly along party lines.   I think what people are struggling with here is *ex post facto justification* for voting for Trump. A lot of Independents were clearly intending to vote for Trump the entire time, but need to vocalize some kind of justification that makes them come off as more persuadable than they actually are. I've witnessed this in-person quite a lot since the campaign kicked off - many people wanted Trump for a variety of reasons, but don't want to articulate exactly why that is, so they make up a plausible reason that they suddenly 'switched.' The reality is that research shows time and time again - American voters are not persuaded by ads. They don't watch them and don't make up their minds based on single ads. [It entirely depends on the frequency of their exposure to many, many ads, and their larger information system.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-022-01487-4) More so than that one ad, the anti-trans *campaign* run by the Republican party and their enthusiastic backers running important digital platforms such as Elon Musk affected voters over time and boosted turnout enough to get the barest points necessary for a win.   I'll say I've never actually met someone that solely voted for something based on anti-trans rights. They're almost always hiding other beliefs that they just aren't comfortable vocalizing to someone they don't think will reciprocate.  Hope that provides some clarity. Can't answer on how other ads compare; would say in 2016 we saw a very similar information environment in regard to Trump voters and digital advertising.",[deleted],2024-11-28T09:23:40,1
"The claims are so outlandish, it’s basically the joke that appears in the opening credits to Succession: [Gender fluid illegals may be entering the country “twice”](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EGErRRyUcAEx3fe.jpg:large)",typicalredditer,2024-11-27T16:20:05,9
"I can't say if the ads were effective.   I can share that I've spoken to a handful of people who voted for trump. They were not maga base voters. Each person brought up far right trans talking points as their main issue: men competing on women's teams, men using women/girls bathrooms and varying degrees of perceived indoctrination of children and teens.",Alternative_Key_1313,2024-11-27T12:55:03,12
">So there's no actual evidence that ad swayed that many people.   Yeah, I think the problem is with the advent of social media, any individual ad is not going to have sway and attention like it would in the past. Ads premiered primetime and many people saw them as there were only a few locations where people got their news and were a captive audience. That's not true anymore, so I generally think we're beyond one specific ad having any significant influence on an election.",ProLifePanda,2024-11-28T10:12:17,2
"When I heard the ad being touted as super effective, I disagreed, too. Most who might care about the T issue were likely decided voters.  However, if the ad was effective , It was effective because it highlighted and reminded people that in first few years of their reign, the Biden Harris team steam rolled ahead on matters/ topics that most citizens don’t understand ( TQIAplus, DEI) in law and policies and has in fact made their lives more difficult while also prioritizing non-US Americans and other identity politics issues over issues and real world struggles (like the economy, safety, free speech) that many were concerned with. The Dems also say they did great with economy. Well, Then they did a horrible job communicating that which is another thing the ad did well.   Dems being horrible at communicating their priorities and successes is also what the ad did well. It highlighted Harris’ crap communication in interviews and town halls. Is trans surgeries for felons a priority to the Dems? If not then why is this one of clearest stance quotes gotten from Harris during the whole campaign (that interview itself was not during the campaign but that is also part of the point) while Harris was too vague on solid action and policies and in all her interview history?   And a although, Dem voters, Dem supporters, TQI plus activists will swear up and down all day long That trans is not an issue anyone cares about, the number one thing every day people noticed and heard from others behind close doors, in anonymous spaces, was  the fear of reprisal;  therefore silence,  around any concern or topic of TQI Plus and even other social justice issues like Israel Palestine. The fear of reprisal or ostracization,  therefore silence around this issue equals self -censorship (because of fear) and citizens taking a closer look at the encroachment on foundational us US American freedoms and closer at this issue no one can talk about freely (especially if they have a dissenting opinion).",Junipure,2024-12-07T11:00:33,1
"Because it’s not literally just about that. That’s a standin argument to say “look at the kinds of outlandish stuff Kamala will say”. And the “they/them” isn’t just transgendered people. It’s more broad. When it says “Kamala is for they/them” the “they/them” is illegals, trans, migrants, coastal elites and whoever the viewer has a grievance with. Some Kamala aides also notes that the tax payer funded part was meant to convey an economic undertone.   I almost think the trans surgeries was just the ridiculous sounding ribbon with which criminals, migrants, and economic concerns were tied together rather than the central part of the ad. So saying it only happened twice or that the policy existed under Trump wasn’t actually able to neutralize the ad at all.",vsv2021,2024-11-27T17:38:32,6
"Senior members of the Kamala campaign have been giving interviews this week.   I recall one saying they prepared multiple responses, but none of them had any traction against the Trump ad.   It landed. I'm in politics and one thing I tell people all the time is no matter how much you think society moved forward on LGBTQ issues the last twenty years... they've stood still on every union work floor. Running a San Francisco progressive, black female, who said things as outlandish as this, was never going to work. My two cents.",skins_team,2024-11-27T16:39:43,10
"I think people are looking for simple, consistent answers for the way people vote, when the reality is the marginal voters that decide Presidential elections are anything but.

"It is a bit weird that people hone in on this and not anything Trump has said or actually done.   I think Harris made a mistake by running such a centrist, moderate campaign. It would never stop right-wing media or the Republican campaign from still smearing her as a progressive. Happens every cycle; they think they can move to the center and it never sticks.",[deleted],2024-11-28T09:10:47,1

If its true that her internal polling showed that she [never once lead in the battleground states](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/27/kamala-harris-advisers-internal-polling/76626278007/) then I don't think running as... anything worked.  I think its more likely that she was just a bad candidate.  I still wish in 2016 it had been Sanders/Trump in the general.  I think it would have opened up the doors to have a true debate about ideas and how to solve them.",AuditorTux,2024-11-28T09:34:33,8
"Well if the internals showed that, then that just means the strategy they went with (a very centrist campaign) wasn't working. There was no pivot point during the cycle where they tried anything different, so I don't know that I agree with the idea any other campaign strategy would have been useless. It's hard to prove a negative.  I think the fact that Plouffe came out and said this is interesting because it makes him look like an incredibly incompetent campaign adviser. ""The thing I tried didn't work so I kept doing it even though I knew it wasn't working."" Very bizarre.",[deleted],2024-11-28T09:41:34,1
"There were multiple pivots in the campaign.   At first the strategy was the Biden basement strategy. She was up in the public polls and according to reports the Obama team members said to hold still and avoid the media.   The second strategy was to distance the candidate from very unpopular things she said during the 2019 primaries. This positioned her as more moderate than the last time the nation saw her in the spotlight.   The third strategy was the Kamala team members winning their argument that she'd benefit from doing more media. During this phase she started sipping beer (Colbert and Whitmer), forcing conversation about her gun she'd totally use to defend her home, and going so hard on the border that she literally ran ads saying she would finish the wall better than Trump would.   None of this worked. Strategy 1 has only worked one time ever, for Biden during COVID. Strategy 2 is desperation. Strategy 3 exposed the real truth of this election: the more people hear Kamala, the less they like her.",skins_team,2024-11-28T11:18:02,6
"Oh I’m talking about pivots in terms of policy/platform. Not media strategy. Harris/Walz was remarkably consistent from start to finish, which was the wrong approach with the kinds of headwinds she faced.  Regardless. None of those pivots seem backed up by much fact to me. I don’t even know what ‘Biden basement’ means - strikes me as some right wing meme. Kamala did lots of media right out the gate. The second strategy seems to be what she did from the start; the third ‘strategy’ as you mentioned is more or less what she did from the start as well.    I’m concerned people are seeing the campaign only in terms of what OTHERS have written about it and not making any empirical observations themselves.",[deleted],2024-11-28T12:14:52,1
">I don’t even know what ‘Biden basement’ means  Biden's 2020 campaign was essentially videos [from his basement](https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/joe-biden-spent-much-of-the-general-election-in-his-basement-now-he-and-his-aides-ponder-a-very-public-inauguration/), released periodically by his campaign.   >Kamala did lots of media right out the gate.

Fair enough, but you might want to get familiar with what friendly media outlets have reported about the two most recent presidential campaigns (sourced by campaign insiders) to hold that particular stance on the topic.",skins_team,2024-11-28T12:26:03,3
"Well if Kamala didn't release videos from her basement I dunno what that has to do with anything. She held rallies immediately [before ](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=26a82fdb3e93f1d905f7f78ada89e2cbd26ecbd8d899f87109e47bc5f14374abJmltdHM9MTczMjc1MjAwMA&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=4&fclid=237a0706-44d0-6e04-3f0a-1243452f6f13&psq=kamala%27s+first+rally&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1FN0VHM2U3S3FwTQ&ntb=1)and after getting the nomination. She was quite visible the entire time.  >She famously  'Famously' according to who? You? By the exact article you're citing she sat down for national interviews within two weeks of Biden dropping out. That's pretty standard when a campaign is just getting off the ground. Prior to that it's not like there was a media block on covering her campaign events or rallies - there was plenty of coverage.  Look. This is not an argument, really. I don't particularly care what media outlets say, because even the ones you've posted are editorializing quite a bit (even if someone thinks they're 'friendly') in a manner that is odd to me.  There is such a thing as 'framing' versus reality and what I am picking up from a lot of people is that they are accepting a framing of the campaign in a certain way that just doesn't align with reality. They are relying on fallacies like 'common sense' or 'everyone thinks this' to validate viewpoints that don't really have any evidence to back them up. That's all.  I prefer an objective look at things - internal campaign memos, strategy documents, etcetera. Survey data and historical case studies by the experts. Primary sources like that. And those indicate the Harris campaign was, if anything, too consistent and mundane, even with the headwinds against them.",[deleted],2024-11-28T12:58:51,1
