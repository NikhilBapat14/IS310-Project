"> The EO's main target is the principle of disparate-impact liability, the idea that racism, sexism, or some other form of discrimination can occur without explicit intent.   Or more realistically, without the plaintiff *proving* explicit intent. Because unless your employer/lender/landlord/etc is stupid enough to put ""we are rejecting you because you're a woman"" in writing, that's extremely hard to prove. More often it's like ""they turned me down and wouldn't say why and then I noticed there were no other women in the building.""   (This sounds extreme but I work in workplace safety and I have been to some businesses where there were 30 men and 1 woman and she's the receptionist. I don't think there's much I can do because as a man who doesn't directly work for them, I don't exactly have standing. But this is a thing that still happens and it wasn't some kind of macho heavy lifting job either.)",pervocracy,2025-04-24T14:37:17,175

I also wonder when/if they’ll make vasectomies illegal and/or mandate that no insurance can cover the procedure. The same goes for women BC and procedures.

"Actually, for trump and these clowns, a long, brutal, methodical plod through the justice system would be *the worst* form of punishment. Subpoenas, discovery, testimony, depositions, all under oath, where they can't lie or they'll be tried for perjury.

That's these guys' worst fear.

Aside from that, however, it's difficult to argue that he hasn't spent time providing aid and comfort to Jan 6th rioters.   Trump has committed many crimes.
