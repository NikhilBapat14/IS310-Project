"> The EO's main target is the principle of disparate-impact liability, the idea that racism, sexism, or some other form of discrimination can occur without explicit intent.   Or more realistically, without the plaintiff *proving* explicit intent. Because unless your employer/lender/landlord/etc is stupid enough to put ""we are rejecting you because you're a woman"" in writing, that's extremely hard to prove. More often it's like ""they turned me down and wouldn't say why and then I noticed there were no other women in the building.""   (This sounds extreme but I work in workplace safety and I have been to some businesses where there were 30 men and 1 woman and she's the receptionist. I don't think there's much I can do because as a man who doesn't directly work for them, I don't exactly have standing. But this is a thing that still happens and it wasn't some kind of macho heavy lifting job either.)",pervocracy,2025-04-24T14:37:17,175
