And now, he doesn’t care. The rest of the Republican Party cares, though, because he is the engine that has driven the party for the past decade. Who is the Republican Party without Trump? They have surrendered their perceived advantage on the economy. Those who remember the glory days they keep referring to are passing on, leaving a generation or two who have been struggling as the middle class erodes. They are shitting on the military now with Trump and his newscaster cronies cosplaying as military friendly.   Which is why the Dems should push hard left. The far right is going to act just like the progressives in the last election, (and probably more extreme). They won’t simply vote Republican; they will only vote for a fringe lunatic candidate like Trump. His death or retirement is going to leave a black hole for the right, which will be the opportunity for the left to enact the guardrails that **should have been in place** to prevent the felon from taking office again and continuing his grift.",idoma21,2025-04-22T11:41:16,1

"My mother doesn’t see news that Fox doesn’t show her. Yesterday, she complained about the Postal Service taking a long time to deliver things. I said, “Maybe it’s your boy in the White House, since he’s in charge of the Post Office now?” She said no, it’s not him, and then she said, “He’s right, the states should handle it.”  Handle what? To the best of my knowledge, that Orange Clown hasn’t (yet) suggested that postal services be handled by the individual states (and what a stupid idea that would be), so she’s confusing abortion (I think) with postal services. Anyway, I played along and said, “So the Postal Service has been handling our mail since the inception of this country, but we should eliminate the department because *he* says it’s a good idea after 250 years of doing it federally?”  “Yes,” she said, “because we need to save the money for government.” (Again, he never actually suggested that states handle postal service duties, so she’s arguing in favor of a policy he doesn’t even support because she *thinks* he supports it.)  Obviously, she has no idea what she’s talking about, but this highlights two things for me (and this is coming from a woman who voted for him a couple of times but didn’t actually want to vote for him this last time; she just didn’t like Harris, and I believe it’s because she’s black, but my mother would never admit that; she says it’s because Harris didn’t visit the border, which we all know was a Fox News talking point during the general campaign).  1. His supporters have no clue what he’s actually up to. They believe negative press about him is all lies. My own mother—who knows I follow politics closely and has heard me complain about both parties at various times—believes I’m a lying liberal who’d deceive his own mother to… I don’t know what… convince her of things she can’t change anyway? As if that’s some kind of “win” for me; to convince mom of things that aren’t true.  2. His supporters will automatically assume his ideas are good ideas while they disregard opposing ideas as a matter of principle. They trust him (because Fox tells them to), and they don’t trust anyone else (because Fox tells them not to). No matter what they hear, Trump is good, and everyone else is bad, even if they agreed with opposing viewpoints prior to Trump’s disagreement; they will abandon their own beliefs for him.  I ended the conversation. It was Easter, I had guests, and I wasn’t in the mood. I instantly regretted even suggesting that Trump might be the cause of the Postal Service’s issues, because it does no good (unless raising my blood pressure and making me want to run out into traffic is considered a good thing). I refuse to even attempt to explain the longstanding battle between the Republican Party and the USPS or their desire to hobble it, drive it out of business, and privatize its services, because that would require her to actually believe me.  My mother is proud of me; she tells me and others often. She thinks I’m intelligent, and she knows I’ve built a nice life for myself. Hell, my whole life she has acted as though the sun rises and sets because her baby boy wills it… but Trump has replaced me, and now I’m just some ignorant fool to her… a woman who barely follows politics and has never actually known what’s going on for as long as I’ve been an adult (30 years) believes Fox News is telling her the truth and her son is either a fool or a liar.  I even made the argument in 2016 that Trump and his cronies put me and my partner (whom my mother also loves) at risk. I guess she doesn’t believe that, either, because it didn’t stop her from supporting him again in 2020, and it doesn’t stop her from calling him “my president” on fucking Easter when she’s speaking to me. I know she loves me more than anyone on Earth, but she refuses to believe me and thinks I’m just too partisan.",dmetzcher,2025-04-22T15:00:37,1

They would rather blame minorities, immigrants, gay and trans people for the problems and that will never change because their worldview is motivated by fear and hate and us-vs-them.    We could solve every major problem if 70% of the population recognized that economic inequality is the root of our problems but the powers that be are too invested and too effective at keeping us poor people divided along social and cultural lines instead of economic ones. That is actually an issue that is a problem for both major parties because both major parties are run by folks with a vested interest in maintaining a society with huge economic inequalities. The only difference is this is a discussion the left actually has but the right does not have. And until the right and the left both have this discussion and realize we need to work together to address that problem things won't change, we will be divided and conquered.

"[Here's one Board Game Publisher's take on the Tariff situation that outlines the math behind board game production](https://stonemaiergames.com/the-math-of-tariffs/) Stonemaier Gamers is one of the bigger publishers in the board game space right now. They are a little unique in that they do direct sales, but also have several titles that have crossed over to the ""mainstream"" big box retail stores, most notably the big hit Wingspan.  It boils down to there not being any specialized manufacturing in the US that could replicate the wood pieces, the plastic miniature figures, the specialize products that some games ship with (especially the recent trend of more ""Deluxe"" game productions with metal coins, specialized piece containers, high end material pieces and game boards, etc...). The rise in hobby board gaming over the past decade has come hand in hand with business relationships in China for manufacturing. And the Chinese manufacturing is a mature industry there. Basically the only thing that could be produced reliably in the US is cards. And if anyone wanted to try and spin up a board game manufacturer in the US, then the materials and the machinery required to run the shop would also be tariffed...  This is in conjunction with the trend of board game publishers funding print runs through crowdfunding platforms. This doesn't affect all publishers, but a good portion of the board game industry is funded this way. A publisher goes to kickstarter, collects funds for an advance for a print run (usually of a ""deluxe"" board game with many pieces of many different materials), usually as a passion project with no capital to help bridge any unexpected costs... like a 145% tariff on goods from China. Companies have already started folding, as they can't pay that price. There's also the issue of companies that have several crowdfunding campaigns in various stages of completion (almost like a house of cards, each subsequent campaign helping to cover the costs of the last campaign). When those cards start to topple, I think we'll see some of the bigger publishers start to fold too. (I'm thinking of companies like CMON games)  On the flip side, crowdfunding direct to consumer sales are probably the safest bet, the tariffs could be past directly to the consumer with minimal markup beyond the tariff on the wholesale price. For the bigger publishers that go the retail route, that tariff is going to have a multiplied effect, as the distributer and the retailer need to turn a profit as well.",TTUporter,2025-04-22T10:56:54,8

I'm also highly educated though, as are many of my acquaintances.  Anyway, all of this isn't to say that Americans and Canadians are the same - there are definitely very big mindset differences that will emerge from living in the richest, most militant nation in the history of the world and being its neighbor - but the things you're pointing out as weird only apply to portions of the populace, and mostly to the savages out in the rural US.

At some point, the mechanisms of decorum, fairness, and truth are beaten by people who simply choose not to hold themselves accountable to those. We will never win a fight if we don't have the same tools they have.",drdiage,2025-04-22T15:17:46,2
"> I 'seem to think' it did what it did.  Really? And what is that? In your own words, not copied and pasted. Because it definitely wouldn't help. And if you think it would, then it definitely does not say what you think it does.   >Update it for the rest. It's not that complicated.  It quite literally is that complicated. The First Amendment says that the government can't tell private cable channels what they're allowed to say on their private cable networks. So unless you have a plan to garner support to repeal the First Amendment, your idea about 'updating it for the rest' is DOA.   The only reason the government was allowed to have *any* say over broadcast channels is because the public airwave spectrum is limited, so the Supreme Court agreed that there is a public interest in some level of control there. The same cannot be said for cable TV or internet broadcasts.",Chaotic-Catastrophe,2025-04-22T15:38:16,0
"I’d be curious if there is a correlation between this and those that are heavily religious. That might be part of the unlock code. Democrats need a pro-democrat religion for the sole purpose of letting people they will burn for eternity if they vote republican, but serve them cake the rest of the time.",h3lix,2025-04-23T02:35:25,2

"I'm not understanding your First Amendment repeal requirement to update the 'fairness doctrine' assertion.The federal and state governments require or restrict speech all the time. You must post X vebage on Y products/public spaces, e.g., ""This product causes cancer."" ""All employees must wash hands."" Or you can not joke about bombs on planes in this area (TSA). The easiest vehicle is when funds are awarded in grants/contracts to private companies. Currently, Broadband and Satellite grants are being deployed throughout the US to improve internet connectivity. Grants and funding pass throughs have restrictions inside and outside the FA3 space. 21 years old and 55 mph or no fed highway funds, public funds for education requiring X teaching. Just like the recent State level porn identification requirements, and the older Telecommunications Act it is possible to moderate content and force cable and internet providers to not either be a neutral party (or a biased one) or else own the liability. Agree political speech is more difficult, but don't waste a crisis. There is an opportunity here, like in '49. Don't get me started on advocating for the Foreigners Shaping Headspace Into Scat Media Extraneous Dilution Influence Act of 2026 (F SHIT MEDIA). *FA3",StrikingRuin4,2025-04-22T18:58:24,0
