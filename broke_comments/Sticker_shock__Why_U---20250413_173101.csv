"There are multiple factors at play imo.      1) American car makers have a reputation for poor quality ... and they earned it. Are all the cars from Ford/GM/whatever dodge calls themselves these days bad? No absolutely not. Have these companies tarnished their reputation by mass producing crap vehicles? Yes. Ford should have never released the powershift transmission. Dodge/chrysler shouldn't have slapped their badges on the cheapest crap they could pass off as cars. GM.      2) Regional differences. A car designed by car designers/engineers who have spent their entire lives in the US simply might not be appetizing to people in different regions who have different needs/wants than US car buyers. I live somewhere where I could comfortably drive a suburban if I wanted to. Would I want one if I lived in an area with tighter/narrower streets than you see in most of the US? Absolutely not.     Same thing with engine displacement: if I lived in a country where the taxes were higher for higher engine displacement, I probably wouldn't want an american car. American market cars with ""small"" engines by american standards tend to still fall into higher tax brackets in terms of euro engine displacement taxes. There's a reason why companies like McLaren and Porsche and so on squeeze power out of engines less than 4L, while Ford/GM/dodge throw 5L+ and 6L+ engines around like it's nothing.      Here's some food for thought: why do companies like skoda and renault have little to no presence in the US market? Is it because they design vehicles with a particular market in mind, and that market is different than the US market?      3) Availability. People tend to buy things that are easily available to them ... big surprise I know. If I lived in Europe and my local car dealerships had lots of european cars available and few if any american cars available (perhaps for reasons covered in my first 2 points) ... I'd be buying a european car.      There's no one car that will please everyone in the world. That's why there's so many car manufacturers and so many models. The car that meets my needs/wants is different than the one that meets the needs of other people.  The car than meets your(reader of this comment) needs may very well be very different than the car I want. The cars that either of us want may be different than the car that someone in another part of the world wants. I know people that want all wheel drive or 4 wheel drive because it's beneficial for the environment they live in. I live somewhere that 2wd is fine year round. I live somewhere that higher engine displacement doesn't incur higher taxes. None of my hobbies require me to haul anything of anything significant size/weight around. I know that those statements aren't true for everyone. Some people wan AWD/4x4 because it's better for their climate, some people live in places where higher displacement means higher taxes, etc ... and they choose their cars accordingly. That's fine.",DonkeyMilker69,2025-04-13T23:15:36,71
"It doesn’t help that American cars just aren’t that competitive. Outside our trucks, what do we really sell to that market that would be competitive? The Japanese dominate the lower cost tier-and for good reason…those things are tanks",Unlucky_Buyer_2707,2025-04-13T19:16:34,76
it also helps when their cars are actually allowed to even be sold.,Stephan_Balaur,2025-04-13T18:02:54,16
They think US cars are gas guzzlers and not as reliable.   They are not technically wrong…,Iamstillhere44,2025-04-14T08:42:13,4
Their engine displacement taxes are a way to add tariffs to American vehicles without actually tariffing it.,jpj77,2025-04-14T07:39:27,3
