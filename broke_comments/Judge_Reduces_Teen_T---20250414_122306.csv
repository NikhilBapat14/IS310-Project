Oh frig right off with this shit. It wasn't self defense he murdered someone all because he got told to move and he instigated it as well.   The crowdfunding site for this bullshit should be shut down and anyone who donated to it should be put on a list as an accomplice to a criminal.

"First off he was in a team tent of the opposite school, where he wasn't welcome(or anyone other than that schools team/staff) as far as I can read. He also shouldnt have had a weapon at a school event in the first place. And yea it would be threatening, he could've easily left. As everyone around the event said he had plenty of time to leave and refused, he wanted violence if you ask me, that's not self defense.   If this were reversed and Austin did the killing, it would be a hate crime and people would be rioting in the street... Instead we pay him/his family close to half a million for murding a white boy, who BTW was a great kid(maybe an asshole but what jock isn't).",Casty_Who,2025-04-14T13:55:11,99
What are you even going on about?  Not one person confirms the killers version of the story.  He wasn't being bullied and he wasn't surrounded.  He intentionally went into the wrong tent. As in he wasn't even supposed to be there.  Also brought a knife to a track meet.  For what purpose exactly?  Do normal teens bring knives to high school sporting events?    This was cold blooded murder plain and simple and if the races were reversed there would be non stop riots.,Pinot_Greasio,2025-04-14T13:47:59,108

"> However, if I were surrounded by a group of people telling me I can‚Äôt sit somewhere and they started physically pushing me etc‚Ä¶ I would feel pretty threatened.  I think his reaction was way overboard, but does he not have a self defense argument?  For starters, he brought a weapon to a school which is already a crime.   His ‚Äúself-defense‚Äù position has virtually zero legitimacy. Self-defense requires an immediate threat of *serious* bodily injury or death. You are also not allowed to use more force that is necessary to subdue the threat. Using lethal force in response to shoving or a fist fight is an unreasonable escalation that would violate a self-defense argument.   Also, you are not allowed to instigate a confrontation and then claim self-defense. If witness accounts are to be believed then Karmelo sought that confrontation out. You are not allowed to create an unsafe situation and then claim you had to defend yourself from the situation you created",Apprehensive-Key2297,2025-04-14T14:16:48,39

Wrong. Also it wasn't self defense. It's a known fact that he provoked the victim and instigated he litetally told the victim to attack him while hiding that he had a knife. That's not self defense morally and legally under state law it's a 100% disqualification.,day25,2025-04-14T14:57:05,65

I just think a case can be made that you felt threatened after someone physically put their hands on you while they were with a group.  I wasn‚Äôt there so who knows if all the kids were acting upset and pissed about him being there, which would lead to a reasonable assumption that you may get jumped if you don‚Äôt do something to get away.

Anyone can allege self defense that doesnt mean you get higher consideration for bail. What matters is what actually happened. When the facts are clear as in this case no they don't grant bail. They grant bail based on political reasons like who did you vote for or what group are you a part of. You were wrong about what they gave Rittenhouse which actually disproves your point.
