right! if your warrant says get tom jones and  you show up and just find a random guy named steve smith you can‚Äôt arrest him. plus you have someone showing you papers and also says my attorney will be here soon.  what‚Äôs the harm to wait for the attorney to clear it up. never mind the lack of due process and you just get whisked into a plane or car to another state to make it hard to receive a fair hearing. grrr,nadine258,2025-04-16T21:08:26,2
