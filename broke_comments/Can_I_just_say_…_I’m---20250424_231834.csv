"Stop watching cable news. They‚Äôre nothing but merchants of comfort and antagonism.  Edit: Tell me how I‚Äôm wrong folks. This is literally the reason that cable news originally existed, to scare you and then make you feel better about it so you‚Äôll watch longer and see more ads.  Watch actual news devoid of opinions and spins as much as possible. Nothing else.",JennyAndTheBets1,2025-04-24T23:30:48,1

Your choice. I just know that the ‚Äústickin‚Äô it to ‚Äòem‚Äù drama is what draws viewers and perpetuates toxicity. Give me local news 10/10 times for information highlights to possibly dig into deeper later.,JennyAndTheBets1,2025-04-25T00:07:22,1
