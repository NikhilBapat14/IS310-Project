Trailer park dei that she is,Own-Resource221,2025-04-16T18:02:27,1
She’s being bribed to do DJT’s bidding through insider trading. It’s how all these incompetent people have these high positions of power and can say and do whatever they want as long as it serves their king’s desires. We need to keep pushing our congress people we elected to uphold their oath to the constitution!!!,Cat_person1981,2025-04-16T18:29:00,2

"yeah and if Trump wasn't able to block people from Twitter on their official government accounts, they should not be allowed to bar people from attending these either. Next time bring enough other citizens and excise your 2a right if it is legally permissible to do so. Make them have to answer to the general public.",Same_Net2953,2025-04-16T18:51:29,2
