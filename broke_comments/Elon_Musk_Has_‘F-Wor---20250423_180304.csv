"To be clear, Musk, who isn’t elected or even an official government employee, arbitrarily picked and installed the new head of the IRS without consultstion or permission, from anyone. Not the President, nor the Treasury Secretary whose job it is to pick the person.   Elon Musk did it. When Bessant found out, he was rightfully incensed and got the whole thing undone two days later. All of it makes Trump look even more useless than he is. Why? Musk literally carried a memo into the Oval Office that he had written, making the leadership change and simply asked Trump to sign the doc.   He did t ask any questions, none of his people had read it or knew about it.   Trump just freaking signed it and Musk got his preferred yes man as head of the IRS.",bruhaha88,2025-04-23T20:21:33,14310

"> As it would turn out, Hitler was really bad at running a government. As his own press chief Otto Dietrich later wrote in his memoir The Hitler I Knew, ""In the twelve years of his rule in Germany Hitler produced the biggest confusion in government that has ever existed in a civilized state.""   > His government was constantly in chaos, with officials having no idea what he wanted them to do, and nobody was entirely clear who was actually in charge of what. He procrastinated wildly when asked to make difficult decisions, and would often end up relying on gut feeling, leaving even close allies in the dark about his plans. His ""unreliability had those who worked with him pulling out their hair,"" as his confidant Ernst Hanfstaengl later wrote in his memoir Zwischen Weißem und Braunem Haus. This meant that rather than carrying out the duties of state, they spent most of their time in-fighting and back-stabbing each other in an attempt to either win his approval or avoid his attention altogether, depending on what mood he was in that day.   > There's a bit of an argument among historians about whether this was a deliberate ploy on Hitler's part to get his own way, or whether he was just really, really bad at being in charge of stuff. Dietrich himself came down on the side of it being a cunning tactic to sow division and chaos—and it's undeniable that he was very effective at that. But when you look at Hitler's personal habits, it's hard to shake the feeling that it was just a natural result of putting a workshy narcissist in charge of a country.   > Hitler was incredibly lazy. According to his aide Fritz Wiedemann, even when he was in Berlin he wouldn't get out of bed until after 11 a.m., and wouldn't do much before lunch other than read what the newspapers had to say about him, the press cuttings being dutifully delivered to him by Dietrich.   > He was obsessed with the media and celebrity, and often seems to have viewed himself through that lens. He once described himself as ""the greatest actor in Europe,"" and wrote to a friend, ""I believe my life is the greatest novel in world history."" In many of his personal habits he came across as strange or even childish—he would have regular naps during the day, he would bite his fingernails at the dinner table, and he had a remarkably sweet tooth that led him to eat ""prodigious amounts of cake"" and ""put so many lumps of sugar in his cup that there was hardly any room for the tea.""   > He was deeply insecure about his own lack of knowledge, preferring to either ignore information that contradicted his preconceptions, or to lash out at the expertise of others. He hated being laughed at, but enjoyed it when other people were the butt of the joke (he would perform mocking impressions of people he disliked). But he also craved the approval of those he disdained, and his mood would quickly improve if a newspaper wrote something complimentary about him.   > Little of this was especially secret or unknown at the time. It's why so many people failed to take Hitler seriously until it was too late, dismissing him as merely a ""half-mad rascal"" or a ""man with a beery vocal organ."" In a sense, they weren't wrong. In another, much more important sense, they were as wrong as it's possible to get.   > Hitler's personal failings didn't stop him having an uncanny instinct for political rhetoric that would gain mass appeal, and it turns out you don't actually need to have a particularly competent or functional government to do terrible things.",aint_exactly_plan_a,2025-04-24T06:54:08,4

">consumers fault for treating political news as entertainment.   Alternatively, I don't think many consumers treat news as entertainment the way people choose to watch reality TV or professional wrestling or sports, but instead have systemically lost the appetite and critical thinking for discerning truth and proper journalism. Corporate media and political strategists and propagandists have leaned into a steady diet of junk journalism, and Americans' short attention span goes for the clickbait resulting in the ad revenue and votes there.   Laziness, apathy, but also many struggling to just stay afloat make Americans vulnerable to manipulation. Journalism used to be about uncovering the whole truth, but now it's more about breaking a sensationalist headline first, then quickly moving on to the next sensational headline.

"> Some of it’s the consumers fault for treating political news as entertainment.   I disagree with this pretty heartily. The people didn't treat it like entertainment, it was slowly morphed into entertainment. Many don't even realize what they're consuming isn't news.   Honestly, being fed algorithms for engagement on various platforms is exploitation. And the media has been working hard to fit into algorithms and compete with algorithms. They're exploitative. They chase views because views are money. People watch because the producers of content have distilled the content down so the viewers base selves are being preyed upon. CNN and Fox News are TikTok for luddites.   I watched my grandmother fall for scam and grift after scam and grift because she had empathy and cared for others. You don't blame your grandma for being too trusting when she gets grifted. You try to find the grifter who preyed upon her trust and hold them accountable.   So much of who people are and what they believe is now shaped by apps designed to be addictive.    Addiction rewires your brain. You start thinking differently, priorities shift, and you lose yourself in addiction.   I think the reason I'm aware and don't fall in too deeply is because I have a dopamine regulation problem. So addiction doesn't work the same for me.

"Regulation for social media can’t come fast enough. Ban algorithms unless the user consents to certain algorithms that show them certain content, make social media platforms essentially publishers who are legally responsible for the content. It’s ridiculous how you can just spread lies and hate speech when back in the day newspapers and TV news and magazines etc would be held responsible for disseminating such stuff. Why is this any different? Ban the technology that creates psychological profiles from your data which can then be used to target you for scams, brainwashing and incitement to violence on behalf of certain political actors. Ban the addictive components. Ban smartphone/ social media use for anyone under 16. The empirical evidence shows that it is detrimental. Might as well give your kid a bag of cocaine to inhale while screaming at them that they’re fat and ugly.  I know it all sounds restrictive but ultimately it’s the opposite. So many people are now slaves to doom scrolling, anxiety, outrage, conspiracy theories, and so many are living in a completely made up reality—THAT is a crime against freedom in my view; how can you be free if you don’t even know reality? So many have been manipulated into supporting things that will ultimately chain them into poverty and authoritarianism—it’s just not worth it for the short amount of time that everyone will be free to spew whatever before the inevitable fascist crackdown on their actual lives occurs, facilitated by the very lies and reality warping propaganda they were ‘free’ to consume.

"You and I both know that while that's objectively and morally the correct way to do things - it is not enough to change American minds in a way that matters.

In fact - they've done nothing BUT lose, because half of america does not care if they're fed blatant lies. Nobody in the GOP cared when the pet-eating immigrants was revealed as a complete falsehood, or even when Vance said he'd keep lying about it despite that fact.  I don't have a good answer for what needs to be done, because frankly, there are no good answers. It's not like we even need to lie about the atrocities being committed, and indeed, we should not.  But America can't afford to not call out when they find a trout in the milk, and acting like you need a signed confession by Musk before making some very mild assumptions (or logical conclusions) about his transparent fascist agenda is a noble gesture that is doomed to failure.

"The US has this absolutist stance to free speech and the US is the country that is now in the grip of a fascist government.   I get that there are issues about who decides what truth is but it’s not hard to establish the truth about many things, like events or the outcome of court cases or science etc. In other countries, if you lie on the TV then people can call you out on it and contact a regulatory body who establishes the truth in a transparent manner with documentation witnesses recordings etc. Then the company that told the lie must retract the lie and sometimes face fines. It’s different everywhere and it isn’t always good enough, eg you can print a lie as a massive headline on the front page or spew it as the main feature on the news but the retraction will often come later in small print on page 7 or as a brief notice at the end of the show. But it’s better than just saying everyone is free to lie.  You cannot have absolute freedom, it is impossible because there are so many people with competing interests and desires—if you were free to murder then of course that infringes on the victims freedom. If you’re free to lie on a mass scale to the public, that infringes upon their freedom to live in the real world as it is instead of in the world according to the desires of a powerful few, which, as the US is seeing now, inevitably leads to authoritarianism and the loss of many more freedoms.",KittyGrewAMoustache,2025-04-24T07:01:22,3

Another friend grew up in a place where arranged marriages are still the majority marriage type, and clans rule everything. Yet another, grew up in unimaginable wealth as an upper caste member.
