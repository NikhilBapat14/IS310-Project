"I'm not a lawyer, but to my knowledge he and his administration can be held in contempt of court. This can come as civil or criminal contempt, and depending on which it is the punishment will vary.  In civil contempt the administration or even individual lawyers can be charged fines until the contempt is resolved, which usually happens when the party in contempt complies.  In criminal contempt, individuals in the administration from lawyers to officials can be jailed until the contempt is resolved.   The two biggest issues are the president's power to pardon and the tools courts use to enforce their orders.  Trump could pardon people held in jail, though I don't think he can help anyone being fined by the court should a judge use civil contempt rather than criminal.   The second, and bigger issue is the fact that judges rely on the US Marshals to enforce their rulings. So if a judge wanted to hold someone in criminal contempt, they would order the Marshals to make the arrest. The problem is that the Marshals report to the DOJ, and the DOJ reports to the president. This could mean that the president could call off any order given to the Marshals, thus nullifying the contempt.   All is not lost though, because judges have another tool. They could deputize non federal officers to carry out their orders and make arrests. This is also a scary situation though, because what happens when these deputized officers come face to face with federal agents with conflicting orders. Armed conflict? Who knows, this is the scary civil war scenario Trump has dragged us into.",Bantis_darys,2025-04-19T17:24:20,456

"In a political system where the party in power isn’t fascist, the president would be impeached and removed.  In our system, Trump will be allowed to operate above the law as long as his voters and his GOP congressmen allow him to.   However, if Dems win the midterms, an impeachment on this crime will be very, very painful for Trump and the Republicans. They will have to somehow figure out a way to argue that Trump is allowed to ignore the courts. They will pay a political price for that, even when they refuse to remove him in the senate .",Y0___0Y,2025-04-19T17:49:45,32

"Members of the administration can be held in contempt. While criminal contempt could include jail time, the chances of this actually being enforced on anyone who is part of the administration are low. Trump can pardon criminal contempt charges.  Civil contempt, however, is not pardonable. My understanding is that civil contempt can only result in jail to compel obedience - it isn't a punishment. More commonly, it involves rapidly escalating fines.  The most important thing to know about these is that they aren't against the government but against *individuals*. If refuse to follow a court order, even if it is because they are ordered by the president not to comply, they are *personally* charged with contempt.  It is at least *theoretically* possible that the President himself could be held in civil contempt, so long as the remedies applied for that contempt don't conflict with his ability to carry out his duties as president. This means that, at least theoretically, the President could be charged very coersive and and potentially compounding fines until he complies with the court.  Beyond this? No. There are no mechanisms to force the Executive to comply with the decisions of the courts.",cromethus,2025-04-19T18:08:57,5

">As far as I can tell with the ruling on presidential immunity there’s also no legal course to take after Trump leaves office so this can be done consequence free?  The President does not have unqualified immunity and SCOTUS left themselves the arbitrators of what constitutes official and unofficial acts.  This question has been asked a few times on this subreddit lately, and there are actually a few different overlapping themes. There is (1) what powers can SCOTUS declare itself to have over the executive, can it order officials in civil contempt? can it deputise people to enforce its orders against the President's wishes? (2) if the President orders the US Marshals to ignore SCOTUS orders, is SCOTUS powerless?   Let's assume the worst case, that the US Marshals are not going to enforce a SCOTUS order against the President and no one SCOTUS deputises will either. Let's assume there is no mechanism for SCOTUS to directly enforce its decisions. Does that mean that SCOTUS is powerless?   No. SCOTUS is also the ultimate arbitrator of whether federal officials have acted within the bounds of their office and the law when determining federal immunity to state laws and civil suits and whether criminal proceeding should be removed from state to federal court. I am not saying that SCOTUS will take advantage of this power, but they certainly have this power.  How would this work? SCOTUS would declare that an act done was outside the color of the office of the person who ordered the act. You might disagree - you might say that the illegal act looks close enough to a legal act that SCOTUS shouldn't make that extreme a finding. But SCOTUS clearly has the power to make that finding, regardless of precedent.  And if that happens, state criminal proceedings are not preempted by federal law. Federal officials that break state laws because they are obeying federal laws or pursuing Constitutional aims are protected, immune, to state criminal charges, but it is ultimately SCOTUS that can decide whether any particular act by a federal official enjoys that protection - and SCOTUS has never said the protection is unqualified.  The President also does not have the power to pardon for state offences, nor is state law enforcement, who would be enforcing state court orders, part of the federal executive and under the authority of the President.  So even if federal law enforcement will not obey federal court orders, SCOTUS is not powerless  because it has the authority to legitimate state court orders and state enforcement of state laws against federal officials.",just_helping,2025-04-20T03:27:15,3

Imagine if the courts can make a decision and then enact and enforce on its own decision, that creates an imbalance in that power.  The system is working as intended, really the next thing is for the Congress to determine if the president is acting out of accordance with his office, and if the Congress believes so they can impeach the president, but if the Congress does not go down that route, then essentially the executive branch and legislative branch is overruling the judicial branch and so in turn the judicial branch is “wrong” in this matter and so it’s power can be checked.",Important_Debate2808,2025-04-19T18:30:54,0

It’s worse. Trump and his allies have been much more openly authoritarian than any of these figures. They are eagerly embracing authoritarianism.

Orbán was once a center-right democratic politician, **but after returning to power in 2010, he weaponized the state and established an authoritarian system.** He taught Trump and the Republicans that the state can be a useful tool – by using it as a weapon for one's own political and ideological purposes.
