"This has always been my biggest gripe about anti-trans, anti-gay, and anti-women beliefs in the military.  Spent 10 years as a combat arms soldier and worked with plenty of women, gays/lesbians, and trans members.  Some were good at their jobs and some weren’t. It almost never had anything to do with their gender or sexuality (I will admit that the physical difference between men and women can cause issues but ultimately if the person can do the job then let them do the job).  What always bothered me is when I might mention that I served with and was under the command of someone who was transgender/gay/women or whatever and someone will ask what that was like.  Like, it was fine? The person was a solid commander and knew how to do their job, what else is there to say?",McMatey_Pirate,2025-04-24T12:51:51,53

"Soldier related medical help but also most trans people are taking some sort of medication to change their body’s sex hormones. Taking away that medication causes all sorts of problems because we all kinda need one of the two sex hormone to function normally.   If someone loses access to these medications and stops taking them, the body will largely resume operating like their assigned sex at birth. This is exactly the opposite of what a trans person wants so you could imagine the mental health impacts of watching your body slowly return to a state you always hated.   While I have everyone’s attention:  Access to gender affirming care is one of the most important things to fight for when it comes to trans people. If you’re an ally, watch for these people to start taking away gender affirming care for all. Passports and sports bans are survivable. Losing hormone replacement therapy is not. To us, it’s a hill worth dying on!",LilytheFire,2025-04-24T17:00:26,1

">transgendered  I appreciate your support,  but just know going forward, ""transgendered"" is not a word. It is usually only used by ignorant bigots or just uninformed people, who i like to educate.   A person is trans or transgender. They are not a trans or transgendered. They are trans or transgender.   ""Transgendered"" implies some kind of outside force or contamination. Saying someone ""is a trans"" is dehumsnization and objectification (in a de-personing, not a sexual way).  I hope this helps in future instances.",TransbianMoonGoddess,2025-04-24T16:00:49,1

"Whilst for many trans people their body will just resume operation on other hormones, I don't think it's helpful to the narrative to centre this subset of the community.  Instead, we should be centring the part of the community whose bodies *won't* just resume operation. For many of us, we *require* supplementation with either testosterone or estrogen, and will for the rest of our lives. Our bodies won't produce hormones on their own, of any kind, any longer.  If I don't have exogenous hormones of some kind, after a while my bones would begin to decay and I would go through *extreme* menopause, which is a direct cause of excess mortality and early death. This isn't 'but what about the mental health effects?', this is 'people will literally die as their bodies require this to continue living'.",Sathari3l17,2025-04-24T19:07:33,1

"Not quite. It was considered normal to call it ""The Ukraine"" according to Soviet fashion. After Ukrainian independence, Ukrainians felt that the ""The"" denigrated the country since it kind of means ""The Borderland"", implying that it was a feature of Russia, rather than its own thing.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name\_of\_Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_of_Ukraine)  So some people still call it ""The Ukraine"", either due to lack of familiarity, or in order to be intentionally politically pejorative.  ""the Canada"" and ""the Germany"" has never been a thing.  Imagine if the region of the US called ""the midwest"" declared independence, and decided that it wanted to keep the name ""midwest"", but didn't want it to be implied that it was ""the midwest"" of the US since it's no longer part of it.",izlib,2025-04-24T17:05:04,1
