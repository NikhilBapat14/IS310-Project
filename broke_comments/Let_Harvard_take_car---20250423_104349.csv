"Of course small liberal arts colleges weren't getting a ton of federal money, and of course they don't have the money to fight losing what they do have.  Which is exactly why Harvard and the other Ivys need to step up and take on the government right now.    So, without disagreeing about any of the principles here's the alternative take: **of course let Harvard use their money to run point on this fight.**    It's not as if Harvard will win this but all the other colleges still get their funding canceled.  Either the administration can cancel funds based on their whims (not laws or the constitution or anything) or they can't.   If Harvard wins, everyone wins.  If we Harvard loses (or is demoralized into not fighting) then everyone loses.    For once, their over-abundance of funds can benefit *everyone*.   To say ""no, let the government cut off their funds, because I don't think Harvard needs it"" is the same as saying ""no, let the government cut off _all of our funds_ because I don't think Harvard needs it.""   Which is classic cutting off your nose to spite your face.",IJustLoggedInToSay-,2025-04-23T10:58:26,18

Poor Harvard. What ever will they do? They only have a 53 billion dollar endowment. They can't possibly operate on a shoestring budget like that.,ki3fdab33f,2025-04-23T11:04:32,-5
Indeed! Too busy fighting and blaming each other to resist the authoritarians. How embarrassing.,Logical_Hare,2025-04-23T11:00:00,0
