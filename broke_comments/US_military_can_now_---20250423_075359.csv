Good use of tax dollars that would already be spent on maintaining those units anyways. Probably more interesting for the troops than sitting in classroom or on the range doing the same training for the millionth time.,PFirefly,2025-04-23T10:26:32,22
The main responsibility of the military is to protect the country and its citizens so I have no issue with that as long as it's the proper LEOs who process them.,Key-Monk6159,2025-04-23T14:55:16,4
Now we just need to take the ones we got and drop em out on the southern border! ü§£,jeepgrl50,2025-04-23T11:40:49,6
US military can now detain ~~illegal immigrants~~ invaders along southern border.,goat-head-man,2025-04-24T08:16:06,2

"No, generally we've avoided giving the military policing powers at home.  As long as it is adjacent to the border, I like it.  I don't want them patrolling ten miles into the US.  But holding a suspected border crosser until Border Patrol can get there and make an arrest while also being able to repel the occasional cartel member who decides to open fire is something that needed to happen a long time ago.",cathbadh,2025-04-23T17:30:16,22

Because American soldiers are to protect other countries borders. Not their own borders.,dankhorse25,2025-04-24T00:42:37,3
The military has lawyers. Set up small connex box courts. Go through due process there same day and ship them back,Lanky_Acanthaceae_34,2025-04-23T11:52:04,16
