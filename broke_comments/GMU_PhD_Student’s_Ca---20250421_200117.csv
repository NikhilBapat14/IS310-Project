What is there to debate? Credible threats to POTUS have always been met with a visit from law enforcement.,hearing_anon,2025-04-21T20:17:46,72
"All these years when subjects like Islamic terrorism and black-on-white crime were forbidden in the halls of academia....and no one dared to ""debate free speech"".",Vessarionovich,2025-04-21T20:05:08,58
"It's funny that Dems are all about ""hate speech isn't free speech!"" when you say horrendous things like men aren't women, but then it's all ""muh free speech, muh democracy!"" when we call for law enforcement to pursue literal death threats, which have literally never been covered by the first amendment.",Zaphenzo,2025-04-21T20:54:04,28
They have the freedom to say it. And also the freedom to experience the consequences of saying it.,reddit_names,2025-04-21T20:41:31,48
"This is the kind of chucklehead that would champion the BLM ""fiery but mostly peaceful protest"" but call January 6th the most violent attack on America since Pearl Harbor.   And I guarantee if someone went to him and said the war was already on and maybe someone should pose the same question about him, he would ***R_U_N*** to the authorities and beg for protection against the mean nasty extremists who are threatening his life over political differences.",TheIncredibleHork,2025-04-21T20:52:48,16

"Isn't this already illegal?  It's also interesting that he (somewhat, but not quite) quotes Robert Heinlein's *Starship Troopers*.  Robert Heinlein would ***not*** have supported this guy's agenda.  >""*When you vote, you are exercising political authority, you're using force. And force, my friends, is violence. The supreme authority from which all other authorities are derived.*""",Algum,2025-04-21T21:38:03,9

"The more realistic debate it sparks is how long will leftists hold off revolting against America? Will they wait until a democrat gets in to office, or will they not be able to control themselves during Trump's current term? With folks like this guy and David Hogg saying the quiet part out loud, it really is just a matter of time before the long dreamt of American communist revolution begins.",triggernaut,2025-04-21T20:16:42,17
I support the Left being honest about their feelings. And free speech is an American right. Keep going!,Cool_Cat_Punk,2025-04-21T21:35:34,1

Exactly.  Even debating this is overly indulgent.  This piece of shit needs about 20 secret service/FBI agents up his self-righteous pseudo-intellectual ass.,Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-04-21T21:35:03,26
"He was intentionally baiting it so he could tell people online that it wasn't literally illegal to say, even if it would naturally result in authorities showing up. It's basically a signal to other leftists to help them feel more comfortable about inciting violence online.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-21T22:06:28,17
Holocaust denial in many European countries will land you in jail.  The notorious Charlie Hebdo magazine fired a Jewish cartoonist over his drawings.

"That's the question. If the government is putting consequences on them, are they really free to say it?",Batbuckleyourpants,2025-04-21T21:44:17,10

Not if the legislative bodies have agreed that it is a crime to threaten it. Now heâ€™ll see due process where his free speech is tested against what the public deems a crime. This is the system working properly.  Nobody is entitled to calls for violence in a civilized society.,RontoWraps,2025-04-21T22:37:17,12
