"More than anything else, *it's the ages of the kids* that should be front and center of this issue. 3 to 5 year olds shouldn't be exposed to *anything* that has to do with sex/gender. Good grief, let them be kids. They have plenty of time to be adults who can form their own opinions on social issues.",social_dinosaur,2025-04-23T08:28:37,87
"this case is over ELEMENTARY SCHOOL children. hopefully regardless of how things turn out in the courts, the parents remember that their mayor/schoolboard/etc. thought this was remotely acceptable when those people seek re-election.  the fact that enough people are trying to opt out that the school calls it ""unmanageable"" says a lot about how parents view this.",reaper527,2025-04-23T09:22:22,23

">A federal appeals court reasoned that on the ‘threadbare’ facts before it, the parents had not demonstrated that exposing their children to the storybooks compelled the parents to violate their religion,”  Bullsh*t. Students are being ""exposed"" to these very controversial subjects through one view only...the affirming, progressive view. There is no room for open, honest discussion from ALL sides. Any child questioning the ""truthfulness"" or wisdom of the content in these books is to be told their comment is ""hurtful."" Students have 2 options, embrace the ideology or shut up.  [Justice Neil Gorsuch followed, noting that teacher guidance says that if a student says a boy can’t be a girl, a teacher should respond that such a comment is “hurtful,” and you shouldn’t use negative words to talk about someone’s identity.](https://www.dailysignal.com/2025/04/22/4-takeaways-as-supreme-court-hears-maryland-lgbt-school-books-case/)  This is not unbiased exposure. This is bullying children into submission.",Farmwife64,2025-04-23T14:44:39,12

"The left pressure-flips everything they do. They decided on their own that schools should work this way *at this age,* and then they've also decided that it's controversial to **oppose** these changes.  As always, the really crazy part is how little the right cares about fighting back. They act like we're doing too much when we're doing too little.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-23T09:08:56,36
That's why they *want* to indoctrinate them young... To influence their opinions as adults.,swd120,2025-04-23T09:08:51,18

The left has had control of education for far too long. Abolishing the DOE would be a great first step to start bringing curricula back to the center.,social_dinosaur,2025-04-23T09:17:23,21
