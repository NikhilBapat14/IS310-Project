"""...you had Democrats bending over backwards to say, we have to bring the temperature down...""  Seriously?  The same people who said Trump had to be ""taken out""? The one that said ""time to put Trump in the bullseye""? Maybe the ones that are silent when 55% of their constituents think assassinating Trump is acceptable.  Is it really any wonder why the left is so violent when they eat up this kind of confirmation bias trope?   The liberal left has real sanity issues.

"Oh sure it's not the corrupt media and leftist politicians calling Trump and his supporters Nazi's, a threat to democracy and other such nonsense.    It's not violent leftist losers firebombing Tesla dealerships, scratching Nazi symbols, and pulling Grandma's out of their Teslas.   It's the bad orange man.  Pure projection per usual with these ghouls.",Pinot_Greasio,2025-04-15T08:36:08,37

"I still don't get why someone who hates Trump would take the words he says to heart and use them to commit violence. I mean, wouldn't it make more sense if it was us committing the violence? I mean, his words of ""violence"" shouldn't encourage democrats to be violent. It makes no sense in my mind",Commercial_Hedgehog1,2025-04-15T13:02:52,1
"\>after the attempted assassination of then-candidate Donald Trump “you had Democrats bending over backwards to say, we have to take the temperature down, we have to bring the temperature down, when they weren’t even the people that ratcheted the temperature up.”  Challenge to leftists: Please document those cases when Dems were ""bending over backwards to say we have to take the temperature down""...........?",Vessarionovich,2025-04-15T18:57:32,3

Justifying an overreaction because of an overreaction to Trump is hardly a good defense.,Shadeylark,2025-04-15T11:19:07,-1
Nobody’s asking prominent Democrats if they denounce terror like the Tesla riots.  But they’ll go endlessly against Trump whether he’s against Arson.,j3remy2007,2025-04-15T09:17:18,45
"They ""brought the temperature down"" on the Nazi crap for about 10 minutes after the attack on Trump. Wasn't even 24 hours before they were back to stoking the flames hoping someone would stop him.",Rush2201,2025-04-15T14:08:15,11

Did you see the poll about shooting the President? Were they conducting polls about that during Biden? ,Blahblahnownow,2025-04-15T10:32:37,29

"The media will never ask Democrats questions like that. They'd be put on the spot and have to pick a side. If Dems chose sanity they'd isolate their violent base, acknowledge rational conservatism, and lose the capacity to scare their voters with lies about Trump.  Nope. Never happen",social_dinosaur,2025-04-15T09:38:31,22
Actually they have been asked but the Democrat always pivots to some screed about how hard it is or how scared people are.,New_Ant_7190,2025-04-15T11:16:26,4
