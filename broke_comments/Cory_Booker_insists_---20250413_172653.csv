"IDK about the President, but I'd bet every penny i have that someone in the administration saw his plan to place absurd levels of tariffs and sold everything they had, then, when they heard he was going to pause most of them, hurried up and bought everything they could.

"I do think stocks were moving really oddly that morning after markets melted down in the overnight session. A meaningful amount of market participants seem to have known knew action was coming. Jumping to assume Trump personally did it is quite a leap. Either someone leaked or the move was telegraphed somehow. There are many benign ways that could happen but also non benign ways. But it wasn‚Äôt a close kept secret that something might be happening, the market stabilized after it looked like a total meltdown was incoming. The natural course without that would‚Äôve been a 5-10% wipe out before the tariff announcement. A lot of institutional investors were clued in.",Unlucky-Prize,2025-04-13T18:24:04,102
