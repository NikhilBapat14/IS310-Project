"IDK about the President, but I'd bet every penny i have that someone in the administration saw his plan to place absurd levels of tariffs and sold everything they had, then, when they heard he was going to pause most of them, hurried up and bought everything they could.  And that's not a reflection on Trump, it's the reality of politics.",cathbadh,2025-04-13T19:54:55,152
Market manipulation - 100%  Insider trading - ehhhh  And he probably has enough plausible deniability to get out of any charges. He’s not dumb.,IhaveAthingForYou2,2025-04-13T18:53:12,206
"I do think stocks were moving really oddly that morning after markets melted down in the overnight session. A meaningful amount of market participants seem to have known knew action was coming. Jumping to assume Trump personally did it is quite a leap. Either someone leaked or the move was telegraphed somehow. There are many benign ways that could happen but also non benign ways. But it wasn’t a close kept secret that something might be happening, the market stabilized after it looked like a total meltdown was incoming. The natural course without that would’ve been a 5-10% wipe out before the tariff announcement. A lot of institutional investors were clued in.",Unlucky-Prize,2025-04-13T18:24:04,102

"People in glass houses shouldn't throw rocks.  From his book:  ""New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker wrote in the early 1990s – while a student at Stanford – about an incident on New Year’s Eve 1984 (when he was 15) in which he groped a female friend’s breast after the two of them had kissed.  “With the ‘Top Gun’ slogan ringing in my head, I slowly reached for her breast,” Booker wrote of that night. “After having my hand pushed away once, I reached my ‘mark.’” The point of Booker’s column was how that moment, and his work on the issue after, had changed him – and his views on women, consent and assault – forever. “It was a wake-up call,” Booker wrote in his Stanford column. “I will never be the same.”""  [Former Booker aide allegedly directed campaign fundraising through city’s watershed - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/states/new-jersey/story/2019/08/29/former-booker-aide-allegedly-directed-campaign-fundraising-through-citys-watershed-1158303)",ApricotNo2918,2025-04-13T18:25:27,-20

"If you went into this thinking the tariffs were a permanent part of economic policy the only thing I can say is that investing is not for you. As literally hundreds of popular right wing thinkers have argued since the start of this fiasco, the purpose of the tariffs are to drive political change in other nations. We can argue about what those objectives were or if he achieved them or even if using tariffs in this way is a strategically sound pursuit of the administration.

"That’s missing the lede. Even as mid term policy they create big problems that are very hard to plan around.   In the short term, cost to hedge has skyrocketed across many asset classes including currencies and stuff is moving fast in response. Economies and growth operate on predictable conditions. When you are investing someone else’s retirement you have to be prudent and you are seeing the result of that. This approach to negotiations is opting everyone into a bombastic real estate deal feel and that’s going to have large real consequences on the economy if it continues. It’s delaying all sorts of private investment even more than this market disruption.",Unlucky-Prize,2025-04-13T19:01:09,40
