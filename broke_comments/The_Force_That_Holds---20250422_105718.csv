"Contempt.  Contempt for the poor, contempt for migrants, contempt for trans people and other members of the LGBTQ+ community, contempt for women, contempt for Muslims, contempt for the black community and other people of color, contempt for intellectuals - the list goes on.

"Jonathan Chait: “As young children understand when they learn the meaning of words, almost anything *might* happen. Trump might put Joe Biden’s face on Mount Rushmore. That’s about as likely to happen as him signing into law a hike in the top income-tax rate.  “It’s true that a Trump-administration staffer has floated a proposal to do so, and the fact that the president said he was open to it—as he says of nearly every idea lobbed his way—is inherently, if marginally, newsworthy. But the important context missing from the coverage that followed is that Republican politicians promise to raise taxes on the rich routinely. Trump, in fact, said many times during the 2016 campaign that he would raise taxes on people like himself.  “This was reported as a novel break from party orthodoxy at the time. But previous leading Republicans had made similar promises. In 2012, Mitt Romney claimed, ‘I will not reduce the taxes paid by high-income Americans.’ George W. Bush campaigned for his tax cuts in 2001 by citing a single mother earning $22,000 a year as his prototypical beneficiary and suggesting that he intended to level the playing field. (‘Somebody struggling to get ahead, somebody working the hardest job in America, pays a higher marginal rate than successful folks, Wall Street bankers. And that’s not right. And that’s not fair.’)  “The common thread in all of these statements, including Trump’s, is that they were misleading. Republican politicians seem to understand that reducing taxes for the affluent is unpopular. Their traditional way of overcoming the drag it creates is to obscure their intentions while attempting to win back votes by changing the subject to other topics, such as foreign policy and social issues.  “... The Republican Party very often promises to do something different from what it used to do. But Republicans in the past promised the same thing.  “Some analysts have speculated that the party’s stance really has changed this time, because Republicans have grown more reliant on working-class voters and less reliant on affluent ones. But the GOP obsession with cutting taxes for the rich was never a response to the demands of average Republican voters, very few of whom had any stake in the tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy that obsessed the party’s policy makers.  “What has genuinely changed is the addition of a new element to the Republican coalition. The party now includes a national-conservative faction, led by Vice President J. D. Vance. According to the *Wall Street Journal* opinion writer Kimberly Strassel, the tax leak came from a former Vance staffer. Compared with traditional conservatives, many natcons seem to care more about winning power in order to crush their enemies than to advance specific policy ends. For that reason, they might be more open to raising taxes on the rich: Why risk losing elections over an unpopular policy that isn’t absolutely necessary for their primary goal of owning the libs?
