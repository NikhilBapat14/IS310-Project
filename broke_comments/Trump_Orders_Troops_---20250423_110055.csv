Eff this. Not another freaking Middle East forever war. Trump was supposed to be the one to STOP this crap!,Zaphenzo,2025-04-23T11:11:21,229
"This is a reinforcement to support current ongoing operation in the region, not a deployment to begin a new campaign. The point is to finish what we started, not carry on forever.",According-Activity87,2025-04-23T12:23:33,34
Born too early to fight in the middle east.  Born too late to fight in the middle east.  Born just in time to fight in the middle east.  I just hope the next generation handles it better than mine did.,Shadeylark,2025-04-24T11:04:26,1
There is an added element here that no one is talking about and that has nothing to do with the Houthis. Trump is building up forces in the region (and bolstering Israeli defenses) as psychological pressure on the Iranians to reach a nuclear deal. Trump is definitely sending a message.,Vessarionovich,2025-04-23T13:41:46,-5
Bro did NOT read the article,TheYoungLung,2025-04-23T18:45:14,10
">These forces include capabilities for air and missile defense of Israel and of locations hosting United States forces as well as fighter, support, and reconnaissance aircraft to enable strikes on Houthi targets.  Calm down, he's not deploying major ground forces. This is just about getting the resources there to finish what we started with tactical strikes.",According-Activity87,2025-04-23T12:18:07,24
"Hard to when WE are the ones getting *attacked*. In any other situation, I agree with you.",TheThunderOfYourLife,2025-04-23T15:38:59,15
"There's a good case to do it, the Houthis are threatening shipping lanes, its creating an actual impact on the US (and European) economy, and no one likes them.  Imo Europe (and even China) should get off their asses on this one too.",hiricinee,2025-04-23T12:15:49,11
He has a soft spot for Europe. We have to wait for Vance to get anything done with that.,kaytin911,2025-04-23T12:15:26,-43
"Oh absolutely, some of this is to bring pressure on Iran, It's a great point to bring up.",According-Activity87,2025-04-23T14:29:04,3
"Pretty sure that's how Vietnam started.  How long till we manufacture a gulf of the red sea incident ala tonkin?  I don't think Trump wants what comes next, but I think there are enough neocons around still that do.",Shadeylark,2025-04-24T11:06:04,1
"Yep, piracy is simply not tolerated, nothing new here.",According-Activity87,2025-04-23T12:20:55,20
"He's more critical of Europe than any president I can think of in my lifetime. Maintaining shipping lanes is critical for the US, not just Europe.",According-Activity87,2025-04-23T12:19:40,37
We're not manufacturing anything here. The Houthis are pirates who need to be dealt with the secure trade routes. None of this resembles a set up for the Tonkin Incident.,According-Activity87,2025-04-24T13:39:50,0
He doesn't lick their ass like the left but he does have a soft spot for Europe.,kaytin911,2025-04-23T13:19:19,-23
"I don't agree, I appreciate Vance's stance too, but I feel both are pretty tough on Europe in regard to them taking advantage of US.",According-Activity87,2025-04-23T13:23:05,1
I think Vance grew up in the bigger aftermath and consequences of America being part of Eurocentrism. I understand what you are saying but Trump is very soft on Europe. He's harder on them than the Eurocrats.   An example would be the tariffs. There is no doubt that Europe should have been the first target of tariffs. They make money through luxury goods that won't affect most Americans and they are terrible trading partners while pretending they are the best. They should have been brought to heel first and separately. Trump's idea of tariffing through trade deficits instead of unfair barriers also favors Europe specifically.,kaytin911,2025-04-23T13:58:19,-12
Eurocrats didn't like that. Vance can't come soon enough.,kaytin911,2025-04-23T15:34:14,3
"I feel like Vance's time forward may be a contributing factor there. You get to see more how Europe barely has any skin in the game when deployed. It's more of a gesture than real support.  Trump isn't just applying Tariffs solely based on trade deficits though. I posted theÂ official release here regarding how they where calculated a while back, they expanded the page significantly since then.",According-Activity87,2025-04-23T15:51:18,2
