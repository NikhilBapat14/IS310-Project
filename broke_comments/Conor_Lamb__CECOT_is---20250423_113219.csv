"It's worse than that, it's a death camp. Still...makes me mad that Fetterman isn't speaking out about this, and Lamb (who seemed to be more conservative) is.",Prudent-Blueberry660,2025-04-23T12:17:53,21
Lamb was the better choice but people got caught up in Fettermans “I dress like my constituents” shtick,c45_2zz,2025-04-23T12:51:38,6
"I mean it wasn't only that. I've followed Fetterman's career since he was mayor of Braddock, and it seemed like he would be a legit progressive voice for us. It's just very disappointing how he has turned out, but I'm not sure how much of that can be attributed to his stroke.",Prudent-Blueberry660,2025-04-23T12:55:10,15
"Yea there's a lot of revisionism going on now that Fetterman has disappointed. If Lamb had won, we'd be hearing the same ""what could've been"" about Fetterman.  Lamb ran a shitty primary campaign in 2022 and was not popular, same old ""I'm electable, both the establishment and Republicans like me"" corporate Dem stuff and was being called ""the next Joe Manchin"". He then was out there condemning other Democrats for being ""socialists"" and his biggest donor was an anti-union firm. He also had a bad PR incident I remember with some voters asking him questions and him getting bent out of shape. I'm trying to look for that source.  That said, if he's taking this opportunity to adjust himself and read the room, then I welcome him back into the mix. I'm just annoyed by a lot of people suddenly acting like Lamb was robbed of the Senate seat or something.  Edit: [An article about his campaign](https://www.phillymag.com/news/2022/04/12/conor-lamb-republican/). With a quote from Elizabeth Warren calling one of his ads ""disgusting""  [He also claimed an endorsement](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pennsylvania/s/9ulInnafYa) from a progressive committee, who then denied they ever endorsed him.",ImLikeReallySmart,2025-04-23T13:31:11,7
