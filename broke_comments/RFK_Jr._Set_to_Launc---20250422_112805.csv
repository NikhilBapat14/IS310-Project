"RFK is choosing to think of autism as consisting of Level 3 individuals only.  The actual majority of people with autism are Level 1 (formerly Aspergers). People that live almost normal lives. Many of whom may go through their entire lives without diagnosis. People who work, raise families, pay taxes. People born with a different brain structure with pros and cons. People that are now being labelled as a ""horrible epidemic"".   In the US, currently around 3% of schoolchildren are diagnosed with some level of autism. The adults was cited by the CDC as around 2% in 2017. This rate is of course lower because identification and diagnosis in schools has become much better in recent years. It doesn't mean that something has happened to our kids, it means that we're much better at identifying it in the early years when it's more noticeable. And ALL of this is over 3% of the population. Maybe slightly worse than the 1% transgender population that gets too much attention and hostile legislation too.  Autism is primarily due to genetics. Science already has a pretty good idea on this. But people don't want to accept this because it would mean it's not brain damage, just genetic variation. There is so much stigma that people don't even want to think that THEY could be on the autism spectrum too. There are probably cases that can be linked to birth damage or outside toxins, or they could cause brain damage that mimics autism. It's not a condition that you can necessarily get an MRI for. It's diagnosed from the symptoms.  I doubt RFK will bring in existing genetic studies, like SPARK. Often adults are only diagnosed when their children/grandchildren are. If you think back, most of us have had relative(s) with neurodivergent traits, but it was just considered eccentricity. Same as ADHD was just kids that didn't behave for millennia. Kids that didn't ""live up to their potential"".   The Wakefield vaccine/autism study was faked. The reason people suspect a causal link is because most traits of autism start to appear about the time that children receive the majority of their vaccines. That's it. Correlation, not causation. Multiple studies have proven no link in the decades since, but the damage was done. So much money wasted.  And now a registry that probably violates medical privacy. I hope the ACLU and other groups fight this as much as they can legally. There are SO many people with autism that choose not to be diagnosed or receive accommodations because of the stigma. And for this reason. What can they do if they appear on the list. What's next? Job discrimination? Health insurance discrimination?",jjmoreta,2025-04-22T12:42:16,69

">Kennedy has drawn criticism from mainstream medical researchers by calling autism “[preventable](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/rfk-jr-autism.html)” and made the [outlandish claim](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj0z9nmzvdlo) that he can find a cure for the condition by September.     Translation: I already know I want to blame all vaccines for autism but I'm saying September because I want to make it look like I'm doing research.  This dingus feeds on conspiracy theories. He isn't mentally equipped to understand that correlation does not mean causation. One reason more people are diagnosed with autism these days is that well...more people are diagnosed with autism. More people are being seen and evaluated by doctors for the condition. Like many neurodivergent conditions it has been under-diagnosed for a long, long time.  Meanwhile RFK's diagnosis of asshole is well established.

This sounds exactly like the first concentration camps that Nazi Germany had as well, taking Dachau as an example. The prisoners sent here included political adversaries, such as communists or trade unionists, homosexuals, and resistance fighters. They kept these people there until they finished their ""re-education,"" agreeing to cooperate with the Nazi's, some, such as clergy or Jehovah's Witnesses, were forced to renounce their faith and pledge loyalty to Hitler before being released.

"Please remember Aktion T4:  > Aktion T4 was a campaign of mass murder by involuntary euthanasia which targeted people with disabilities in Nazi Germany. The term was first used in post-war trials against doctors who had been involved in the killings. The name T4 is an abbreviation of Tiergartenstraße 4, a street address of the Chancellery department set up in early 1940, in the Berlin borough of Tiergarten, which recruited and paid personnel associated with Aktion T4. Certain German physicians were authorised to select patients ""deemed incurably sick, after most critical medical examination"" and then administer to them a ""mercy death"". In October 1939, Adolf Hitler signed a ""euthanasia note"", backdated to 1 September 1939, which authorised his physician Karl Brandt and Reichsleiter Philipp Bouhler to begin the killing.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aktion_T4",CrimsonBrit,2025-04-22T18:37:01,4

"[Your Full Name] [Your Street Address] [City, State, ZIP Code] [Email Address] [Phone Number] [Date]   The Honorable [Senator’s Full Name] [Senator’s Office Address] [City, State, ZIP Code]   Dear Senator [Last Name],   I am writing to you not just as a concerned constituent, but as an American witnessing a critical unraveling of our democratic norms, laws, and institutions. At this moment, the usual boundaries of governance—policy debates, procedural checks, institutional courtesies—are being willfully ignored or weaponized by a regime that does not recognize the rule of law or the legitimacy of constitutional constraint. This is not politics as usual. This is a crisis.   When those in power defy the very structures that give them legitimacy, the response from Congress cannot be one of business-as-usual. This moment demands more than words, more than symbolic resistance. It demands that those elected to defend the Constitution rise to meet the urgency of the threat we now face.   If the legislative levers of Congress are now insufficient to stop this slide into authoritarianism—whether through obstruction, executive overreach, or judicial complicity—then the people must be called to act. That call must come from you and others with a platform, the moral courage, and the constitutional duty to sound the alarm.   Use your megaphone. Speak to the nation. Make it unambiguously clear that what is happening is a coordinated attack on democracy—and that it will not be tolerated. It is time to organize a nationwide response that matches the scale of this emergency.   A general strike is no longer a radical idea; it is a rational defense of a system under siege. We cannot be expected to continue contributing to a society that enables or tolerates the dismantling of our rights, freedoms, and the very rule of law.   History will remember what you did in this moment. I urge you: Do not be complicit through silence. Be the voice that helps galvanize the people. Be the leader who does not wait for a safe path, but who forges one for the preservation of our democracy.   In hope and resolve,   [Your Name]",Helpiamilliterate,2025-04-22T13:56:48,3

"Autism and vaccines. The truth (from a biologist). Once upon a time a greedy man wanted to make more money from his version of the triple vaccine. His company gave the vaccine in different injections, hence why he was being out competed.   So what this greedy little man did was pay of a study to falsify evidence to show the triple vaccine (his competitor) caused autism whereas his was safe.  Cut to today, we have done countless trials and studies to demonstrate he was wrong, and he was even prosecuted I believe. Yet no one remembers that.   Today the cases of children dying from diseases that are preventable from vaccines are rocketing. Thousands of innocents are dying because of this man. Most of the diseases vaccines prevent are also untreatable and deadly. Hence why it’s so important.  There is also both wrong with being autistic.

"I have two profoundly autistic children. There is no hiding it. It is obvious to anyone who meets them there's a disability, even if they don't know the name.    Most people never cared about disabled people. They are seen as worthless and taking resources from more deserving people. This administration will only make that stigma more overt.    Because the majority of people and families won't be impacted. Just make everyone else believe autistic people are taking from them, and they'll just about drive disabled people to the camps themselves.    I urged some of our fellow parents to start getting passports. It'll be hard to settle anywhere long term, but getting out is the first step. I can't tell you how many told me to ""drop the dramatics"" or that this wasn't a problem at all because they believe RFK Jr. will find a cause.    Even with the gutting of all the agencies that WERE researching autism... And all the agencies autistic people rely on to live.    It'll come swiftly, without much resistance. People believe it can't happen here. They believe the surface level bullshit they're told, that they're the good guys, they wouldn't possibly deport or kill millions to save millions.    Your life is only as valuable as the taxes you generate. ",Jumpy_Presence_7029,2025-04-22T17:41:31,3

It's like he's never understood the contribution autistic people have made over time before it had that word attached to it. Most of the greatest inventors, artists, and scholars throughout history we're always described as a little bit different, odd, quirky. Sound familiar?

Secondly and I know this is an old used trope but this is exactly what authoritarian regimes do to start categorizing "" less desirables "", ""genetically flawed"" etc . Pick a term, any term but generally this is what starts the process.  This is exactly what nazi Germany did before they started eradicating people.

"Can someone explain if this is a HIPAA violation? If it isn’t one, how/why does it not constitute as one?  ETA another comment I just made in a separate sub after looking into it:   HIPAA establishes national standards to protect individuals’ medical records and other personal health information (PHI). It applies to “covered entities” (healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses) and their “business associates” who handle PHI. Under HIPAA, PHI can be used or disclosed without individual authorization for specific purposes, including:​  -Public Health Activities: Such as preventing or controlling disease (RFK Jr. is framing autism as a disease he would like to prevent, so I’m guessing this is his justification)  -Health Oversight Activities: Including audits, investigations, and inspections.  -Research: Provided certain conditions are met, such as obtaining Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval *or* patient authorization.​ (emphasis on “or”. There are other ways he can get approval without gaining a patients explicit authorization)   If the data collection aligns with these permitted uses and follows the required safeguards, it may not constitute a HIPAA violation.​   By no means am I agreeing with this initiative or the stated intentions of RFK Jr., because it’s clear he has a gross misunderstanding of what autism is and how it impacts individuals, but I fear that this process will be lawful given the current legal framework. I believe the data collected would still have to be void of certain identifiers to be legal, such as the names of the people who’s medical info will be reviewed, so I’m trying to calm myself down and stay hopeful that they at least adhere to that standard… but I have severe doubts about that, or at least that the information will be handled correctly and not maintained/stored in a manner that would be easily compromised by outside actors.   I understand that these particular provisions in HIPAA are set in place with good intentions, like studying viruses, diseases, etc., but it’s alarming and disheartening to see it potentially being used with RFK Jrs. goals in mind and given his past statements about mental health research and mental health treatment.",TheFunUsernamesRGone,2025-04-22T13:50:47,2

This is dangerously close to the deep misunderstandings of genetics that led to the rise of eugenics in Nazi Germany. By nature there are differences in genes and chromosomes and the idea of fitness within an environment depends more on the environment than the genes. They will condemn autism as a malady and the autistic in society will suffer because of this. There is an opening here that could lead to condemning other types of “differences” and slowly you will have a bastardized form of eugenics.

"Subject: I Strongly Oppose RFK Jr.’s Plan to Create a Registry of Autistic Individuals  Dear Senator [Last Name],  I am writing as a concerned constituent and as a parent of a child on the autism spectrum to express my deep alarm and unequivocal opposition to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s reported plan to create a registry to track autistic individuals in the United States.  Such a proposal is not only invasive and dehumanizing—it is profoundly dangerous. History has shown us the perils of government-led efforts to “register” populations based on medical, psychological, or neurological diagnoses. It opens the door to discrimination, stigmatization, and potentially even persecution. There is no scientific, medical, or ethical justification for compiling a federal list of autistic people.  My child, like so many others on the spectrum, deserves dignity, privacy, and the full protection of their civil liberties—not to be cataloged by a government database rooted in conspiracy thinking and outdated, harmful narratives about neurodiversity.  I urge you in the strongest possible terms to publicly denounce this proposal and to take legislative action, if necessary, to ensure that no such registry is ever created. Our nation must stand for inclusion, acceptance, and evidence-based policy—not fear-mongering or pseudoscience.  Thank you for your time and your commitment to protecting the rights of all Americans. I look forward to your response and to seeing you take a clear stand against this dangerous idea.

Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.""  And I'll just drop this here...   ""Between 1939 and 1945, Nazi doctors, under the guise of medical advancement, killed 300,000 disabled children and adults. Throughout German cities and townships, disabled “patients” were identified by clinicians, psychiatrists and social workers, and required to register with Nazi officials. Diagnostic records characterized them as “useless eaters,” “lives unworthy of living” and “burdens upon themselves and the nation’s resources.” They were loaded into vans with black-painted windows—nicknamed “death buses” by local children—and transported to the killing centers, countryside hospitals and institutions just outside of picturesque cities such as Dresden and Potsdam. In Berlin, “death committees” of physicians determined whether disabled people should be released, or, if their documents were marked with an ominous red cross, taken to their deaths.  The killings began with disabled children as young as three, many of whom were starved to death in hospital beds or killed with lethal overdoses. As a direct pre-cursor to the Holocaust death camp murders, adults were herded into crowded air-tight chambers; those who relied on wheelchairs or crutches were carried inside by orderlies. Heavy metal doors slammed behind them, and the chambers flooded with poison gas. Afterward, some dead bodies were carted to a nearby crematorium; others were singled out by medical staff to perform autopsies for research.""

What does Tim Snyder say? *Do not obey in advance.*   Early intervention and early access to high quality support, therapy and programs is absolutely crucial to get good outcomes for people on the autism spectrum, so everything should be done to help people get a diagnosis, not the opposite.   Anything Americans can do to stuff up their numbers, must be done.   How we do this in Australia is that schools need to provide the government with a numerical set of numbers each year.

Several years before the Nazis devised a “final solution” for Europe’s Jews, they had already begun sorting their citizens by ability and claiming the Reich had no place for people who were different. Nazi doctors and psychiatrists led the charge, endeavoring to mold certain “autistic” children into productive citizens while sending others to be murdered at Special Children’s Wards throughout the Reich.  https://mjhnyc.org/blog/autism-and-disability-in-nazi-vienna/",CrimsonBrit,2025-04-22T18:32:56,2

"> In mid-1939, Hitler authorised the creation of the Reich Committee for the Scientific Registering of Serious Hereditary and Congenital Illnesses (Reichsausschuss zur wissenschaftlichen Erfassung erb- und anlagebedingter schwerer Leiden) led by his physician, Karl Brandt, administered by Herbert Linden of the Interior Ministry, leader of German Red Cross Reichsarzt SS und Polizei Ernst-Robert Grawitz and SS-Oberführer Viktor Brack. Brandt and Bouhler were authorised to approve applications to kill children in relevant circumstances, though Bouhler left the details to subordinates such as Brack and SA-Oberführer Werner Blankenburg.  > Extermination centres were established at six existing psychiatric hospitals: Bernburg, Brandenburg, Grafeneck, Hadamar, Hartheim, and Sonnenstein. One thousand children under the age of 17 were killed at the institutions Am Spiegelgrund and Gugging in Austria. They played a crucial role in developments leading to the Holocaust. As a related aspect of the ""medical"" and scientific basis of this programme, the Nazi doctors took thousands of brains from 'euthanasia' victims for research.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aktion_T4#Killing_of_children",Griffolion,2025-04-22T13:00:04,1

T4 “Euthanasia” Program (1939–1945): People with physical and mental disabilities were also registered under this secretive program. It began with a questionnaire sent to hospitals and institutions to identify individuals with severe disabilities. Those selected were later murdered under the guise of medical care.   3.

"Ok what is actually happening with this? I’m genuinely confused.   When they say “eradicate autism” to me that doesn’t make me believe they’re gonna murder every autistic person, to me it means that they want to prevent people from developing it in the first place. It sounds like he’s putting resources into researching the environmental causes of autism, so we can eliminate them. So he needs to find out who has autism and what their medical history is like in order to understand what factors contribute to the development of autism.  I’m not saying I agree with him 100%, but I also don’t think he’s that much in the wrong. I will say that what he said during the his speech about autism ruining families and how autistic people will never be able to play sports or even use the bathroom unassisted was awful, but it was taken out of context. He later corrected himself, claiming that he was speaking about specifically non verbal cases of autism.  I’m trying to get both sides to this story.

They're attempting to reframe innate neurodevelopmental conditions as *socially manufactured*.  They then sidestep the moral obligation to accommodate them. It’s a capitalist sleight of hand—if disability is seen as *circumstantial, not structural* then they can justify forcing people back to work by denying the legitimacy of their impairments.  In a productivity-obsessed system, people who can’t conform to normative work structures are seen as inefficiencies. Reframing disability as a fixable, social issue allows policymakers to justify rolling back protections, supports, or even diagnoses, because “it’s not real,” or “it can be overcome.”  Fuck these assholes with a pinecone.",drbirtles,2025-04-23T09:31:20,1

Remember when your grandpa sat in the same chair, watched the same program and had the same bologna sandwich every day? He hated crowds, loud noises and bright lights? Yo granddaddy was autistic.  Fun fact!: The more advocacy you have in a particular field, the more people will study that field, and hence understand neurological symptoms. Oh wow! Autism ISN’T JUST for little white boys! Who knew?!?   Here’s the REAL issue: we KNOW there are more autistic people in the world than just your undiagnosed granddaddy. It’s not an epidemic, it’s just SO HARD TO MASK when the US is going to shit. Our neurological system is being FLOODED with information to simply survive, and survive with little to no support… While allistics can distract, we can’t function, and I KNOW yall are all stressed the hell out as well.  There aren’t more of us, we just can’t keep up with a failing, collapsing, apocalyptic system.  You all want us dead anyway…. Unless you see us on NetFlix dating.

If RFK claims it's for research, then all info he'd receive from Covered Entities would have to be de-identified and anonymized before being released to him/the govt.

"In fairness, the article should mention that there are tons of disease registries already out there and this one sounds just like them. Disease registries are just databases that are essential for all kinds of medical research, which the New Republic does not acknowledge in the article. Some of the existing registries were created using information provided voluntarily by patients, true, but others used sets of existing medical records. The key is that the data are stripped of personally identifiable information and only then dumped into a database that is opened to researchers, or even the general public.  It absolutely does matter what information is made public, but this article does not mention any controversial data types, and the mere fact that medical records are used to create a disease registry does not necessarily mean that something evil is happening. The New Republic's author should have pointed all this out, otherwise people were likely to react just like they are now reacting, so the article either represents the intentional use of  scare tactics or the author is ignorant of the normal processes for creating a registry.

In a productivity-obsessed system, people who can’t conform to normative work structures are seen as inefficiencies.

It takes longer for them to understand these nuances.   In the past it was easy for them to understand that doing something your parents didn't like meant you got hit. Causes so many more problems down the road, but the kid behaves when they're young and get much better at masking.  This leads to them never going to the doctor because that would shame their parents and they never get diagnosed.

Call the office, ask questions, and tell them what you want: any permission to share the information to be revoked immediately or knowing what steps you'd need to take to do so.  \* Think about your children's school: do they know of your child's diagnosis?  How do they share information at the county/district/state level and can you opt out or revoke previous consent?    \* Think about your health insurance: contact them and again, revoke permission to share your medical information for research.

I have not yet ventured into this so I have no idea what to expect here.  \* If you as an adult have autism, did you tell your employer?

"Ironically, this is why autism diagnoses have spiked over the past thirty years. It used to be believed that autism was the result of emotional neglect. Psychiatrists didn’t want to tell distraught parents that they didn’t love their children properly. As such, autism was far more likely to be diagnosed as schizophrenia. However, as it became more clear that autism had an innate cause the stigma of the diagnosis disappeared and doctors were less reluctant to recognize it for what it was.",SlightlySychotic,2025-04-22T14:19:42,1

"I'd encourage this, plus organizing with anyone else you know who's in the same boat. I'm still hopeful and relatively confident that this won't all end in a worst case scenario (I'd be far more concerned if there was a clear platform they were all working towards, but from the past few months it's clear that it's disparate groups all trying to push their own sometimes contradictory agendas while the main charismatic leader is concerned solely with himself and his image. Overall the picture is much less threatening than if this were a unified front with clear goals) but it never ever hurts to be prepared.   Make friends, learn to shoot, have clear plans for stuff (""if X happens, we do Y"") and get into shape. If this DOES devolve into outright Nazi shit either under this government (which, again, I think the odds of that are fairly low) or a future one, it's a hell of a lot harder to oppress a competently armed and organized citizenry. The people who are geared up to do this sort of thing do not like to be shot at. If they're losing 2 or 3 Nazis each time they try to grab someone for the camps, that makes them much less likely to be willing to do that.   These aren't the real Nazis from the 1930s and '40s, where a 30 or 40-something year old officer or soldier had personal experience fighting in the trenches of WWI. These are soft people who haven't ever been exposed to serious violence, especially directed at themselves. The cops at Uvalde weren't Nazis, but they're a good example of how risk-adverse even trained police officers are: they wouldn't run into a building to save children who were actively being shot by a single man, does anyone really think that even the fashiest modern fascist is going to run into a building of multiple armed and ready people to throw an autistic kid into a camp?   An armed and organized populace is also one of the best checks against civilian paramilitary groups (think KKK) who may have the tacit approval of the government but not their outright support.

"Rfk is being an idiot. And to be extremely clear, just cause he's an idiot doesn't mean he is harmless.

This is a very simplified example but it is one that you could potentially find.   With that said.

There is always a list for everything, but it's always been opt in and the drug companies ususally pay for it.

"It's political capital rather than monetary profit, but by doing this he looks effective to the people who have opted in to the worldview.  They'll follow that warm glow of surety anywhere, even when he and his fellow horrors push things that would otherwise have them balk.

The margin on vaccines, especially childhood vaccines, is razor-thin and only held up by government entities and nonprofits.  Plus they won't have have legal risk for selling them, particularly important during RFK Jr. and Trump's reign.  So they may not profit, but they'll take the lessened liability.

"Well, there was a situation in Australia where increased sunscreen use actually did lead to more skin cancer. People thought that they could stay out in the sun all day because they had sunscreen on, where before, they'd cover up or go inside during the worst hours of the day. Covering up or being indoors is always way better than sunscreen for skin cancer risk--and that's made worse by people not always applying sunscreen evenly or frequently or using a high-enough SPF. So in that case, there was a correlation, but not causation, of course.   Semi-similarly, menthol cigarettes are worse for you than regular, even though they're all bad, of course. The menthol has a numbing effect on the throat, so the person feels less irritation from smoking and is likely to inhale more deeply, hold it longer, smoke more...whatever. So it alters behavior, which leads to a higher risk.  Not similarly, there was also a case where they developed a new screening tool for a kind of GI cancer that led to more deaths, weirdly, rather than fewer. It turned out that there was an aggressive kind and a slow-growing kind, and loads of people had died *with* (not *of*) the slow-growing kind with no one knowing about it, since the disease tended to affect older people to begin with. But when screening revealed all these cases, they treated them all, not realizing that they differed, and sadly, the treatment for these kind of things is dangerous, especially in older people and people with other health issues.",macphile,2025-04-22T14:50:08,18

"As someone with ADHD, I would at least talk to the doctor about your concerns about the possible issues with an official diagnosis, but that you still want to know what to do to handle the situation.   I know before getting diagnosed as a kid, it was incredibly frustrating because I knew I could do stuff in school, I just couldn't get myself to actually do it. My grades suffered, teachers treated me like I was lazy and dumb, and it just wore on me until my mom and I were trying to study math one night and I got so frustrated I couldn't do it as easily as her or everyone else and threw my book out of the kitchen and broke down crying. Instead of getting mad she decided to get me tested and we figured out I had ADHD.   On the other hand, my friend's brother in law had a mother who found out he was autistic but didn't tell him or do anything to work with him, leaving him to grow up not knowing he was autistic. She didn't want him to ""feel different or get treated differently"" which I understand, but the problem is that he's already different. He just didn't know why or ever learn to properly live with his autism and it's still fucking life up for him now.   I don't know where I'd be without my diagnosis (and medication, but I don't know if that's a concern with autism) but given how hard it still was to get through school with the various accommodations, my medication and our understanding of what was going on, I don't see it having ended particularly well.",aaronwhite1786,2025-04-22T14:33:03,2

A blood test is not needed to get a diagnosis. It is an information gathering exercise, which the government cannot necessarily monitor.   What you can do with a diagnosis, if indeed you get one, is to tell your daughter's school, which will be very helpful to them in structuring a program for her. Just don't share the paperwork - show them, but don't let them copy it or hold it.   That is what I would do.   Early intervention is absolutely crucial in getting good outcomes later on.

"Not trying to scare you (because I know a diagnosis is necessary for government programs), but an autism diagnosis means she will be permanently excluded from military service, may permanently bar her from considering an aviation career, and could potentially exclude her (illegally) from other employment. People really don't like mental disabilities because it's a liability, and (unlike breaking your leg or getting the flu) consider any diagnosis permanent.  An anecdote — to apply for a government job, I had to explain (with graphs/medication/notes/evidence) and attempt to ""prove"" my anxiety diagnosis from 15 years ago wasn't a current issue to several government doctors/investigators. Needless to say, it makes the whole polygraph/interview experience a lot more unpleasant and lengthy. Anxiety is often temporary, so I can't imagine how difficult a syndrome like autism would be to explain.  I know a lot of people hate the military and would never consider it, but it can be a really great experience for some people, can completely pay for college, and opens a lot of doors to federal employment.

This order highlighted the participation of midwives. They were paid a small sum for each infant they reported. Parents were encouraged to surrender their children with disabilities to the care of state-run residential clinics. There, medical staff secretly murdered the children by starvation or lethal injection.  As German policymakers shifted the country’s economy onto a war footing, they began to view people with disabilities as a financial, as well as genetic, burden. The so-called “racial hygiene” policies of Nazi Germany took a radical turn. Portrayed falsely in propaganda as “mercy deaths,” the secret, so-called [“euthansia” program](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/narrative/4032) soon expanded to include adults with disabilities as well. ",WesternFungi,2025-04-22T16:48:37,2

"The answer lies in the definition of ""disease.""   At the most basic level, a ""disease"" is a mechanical difference from the typical. You have an infection. Your heart is weak. Your liver is damaged. Your brain is injured. So on and so forth. Some of these are pretty clear cut: something is not working correctly.  There's a tricky word though: ""correctly"". When you're looking at an actual mechanical issue, the lines are pretty clear. When you're looking at behavioral issues, though, it gets fuzzier. It's harder to say that a particular way of perceiving and interacting with the world is ""correct"" or ""incorrect.""  There are cases of extreme autism and ADHD where it falls pretty clearly into ""something's wrong"" and the DSM actually accounts for this. Diagnostics with the DSM generally require that the person meet the criteria and that *they impact the person's ability to function.*  Not everyone with autism is unable to function.

"because it ignores specific harm being done to autistic people by over generalizing. yes neurodiverse people are generally under attack but acting like a specific attack directed against autistic people, many of whom also have adhd, is generalizable is not really appropriate.

We can appropriately discuss specific harm and responses to what is happening right now without hypothesizing about what could happen to people with adhd. i think that people often assume that all neurodivergence can be discussed under the same umbrella but this has often served to undercut the experiences of specific population which contributes to a broader erasure of autistic needs and experiences",Zekey6669,2025-04-22T18:16:38,0

"It's one of those things that's more understandable to feel the need to track, but there are a number of issues with the way we're doing it.    Start with the sex offender charge, it can be a surprisingly low bar. Some examples other folks brought up - pissing on the side of the road. Yeah, it's not ideal, but like... I've been there before. A lot of folks have.    The other issues include the fact that it's..kind of a permanent brand. This isn't exclusive to the sex offender registry, but any kind of 'permanent record' means that anybody on that list is effectively unemployable and marked for life. So, we have low bar to get the label, and a permanent, life-long 'for all intents and purposes' social pariah status. On top of whatever consequences they had decided in court.    Additionally, not all crimes are equal. I personally know some folks who ended up on that list because the person they were with lied about their age. Well, legally, they're now a statutory rapist. And they're branded with that for life, because they didn't feel the need to try to be like ""no, show me your ID"", which yeah that's something I'd do now, but back when I was 19 or 20? It wouldn't have occurred to me.    And then you have straight up false convictions. Happens in every legal system and I don't have many ideas on how to resolve that.    So... so far, we have a combination of it being a relatively low bar to be branded for life and have nearly all future employment options stripped from you, high chances of fucking your entire life, forever, even if you were falsely convicted, even if you were arguably a victim.    And to top it off, the legal definition of 'sexual offense' can change. In fact, members of our current presidential administration believe that anybody who is outwardly LGBT+ in any way (they get to decide what counts - maybe something as trivial as a hug, a kiss, holding hands, or wearing a rainbow accessory) can be deemed as a sexual offense. It used to be this way. LGBT+ folks were thrown in jail for the crime of existing just a few decades ago. It can easily come back, and everyone's gonna be on that list.    Also fun fact did you know there's a growing call to put sex offenders to death by the current ruling party? Some have offered just sending all 'sex offenders' to the prisons in El Salvador.",WickedTemp,2025-04-22T12:44:45,1

"> Apparently Germans in Nazi Germany willingly surrendered their family members to be euthanized because of patriotism etc.  Afair, they didn't know their kids were going to be euthanized in the beginning.   It started off as a program to ""cure"" disabled people and that is how they convinced families to send their kids to these centers. Many were euthanized the day they arrived at these ""treatment"" centers and then officials gave updates to their families as if their kids were still alive, even going so far as to forge postcards written by the kids.   Eventually they would notify the families their kids died from various things. People eventually got suspicious when no kids were returning or they were listed as having died from something they couldn't die from (like someone without an appendix can't die from appendicitis).   In response to the outrage, the Nazis just moved the treatment centers out of the country, but kept them running and euthanizing.

"I'm not sure what you mean. Thousands of lawsuits have been filed, protests have occurred attracting hundreds of thousands to millions, universities are now striking back, the press freely reports every new development with growing alarm and there have been constant New York Times op-eds about how the US is sliding into autocracy. Trump's approval rating is underwater. I myself have attended protests along with 100k+ others in my state.  What more do you want us to do? I don't know what country you're referring to but if you have studied history you will know that just obviously sliding into autocracy is not enough to spark action on a level needed to end a government. There needs to be something that causes a legitimacy crisis, a protestor being murdered, an economic recession, an obvious and theatrical betrayal of the people like Yanukovych in Ukraine.  Like you realize autocracy does not equal people rising up. This has almost never been the case. I mean OK you have stuff like Yoon in Korea but that's a bizarre exception, that was more like he lost his mind and suddenly declared himself dictator without any preparation, not a broader takeover. There needs to be something so egregious it causes a total loss of faith. Trust me unrest will rise once the economy enters a recession in 2026 as a result of Trump's economic policies.  Edit: I also strongly agree with your edit to this comment, this is why I'm not afraid. Trump is extremely weak and despised by large parts of the population. Once Americans realize government requires the consent of the governed they'll act. A lot of them are just too, uh, I mean uneducated -- I'm sorry, just being blunt. There are a lot of Americans who actually don't understand the concept of popular sovereignty and think if they can no longer vote and legal methods have been exhausted it's over.

The biggest industry now in rural areas is prisons. I am going to change that. I'm going to make it so people can go, if you're convicted of a drug offense, or if you have a drug problem, you can go to one of these places for free. They're going to grow their own food, organic food, high-quality food because a lot of the behavioral issues are food-related. A lot of the illnesses are food-related. There won't be any cellphones there. There won't be any screens. We're going to reparent people, restore this connection to community. We have a whole generation of kids who are dispossessed, they're alienated, they're marginalized. Their suicide rates are exploding. … Last year, 107,000 American kids died from drug overdoses, namely fentanyl and other opiates.  > […]  > You got a whole generation of kids who is damaged. I'm going to create these wellness farms where they can go to get off of illegal drugs, off of opiates, but also legal drugs, other psychiatric drugs, if they want to, to get off of SSRIs, to get off of benzos, to get off of Adderall, and to spend time as much time as they need — three or four years if they need it — to learn to get reparented, to reconnect with communities, to understand how to talk to people. There'll be job training, particularly in the trades.  In my opinion it makes the ICE raids look a bit worse even. It's not just the petty xenophobia of a single man, Trump, driving the mass deportations and ICE raids but part of a much larger and better orchestrated plan. RFK was talking about putting people with ADHD, autism, anxiety and depression in work camps a solid MONTH before Trump introduced [""Mass Deportations Now!""](https://apnews.com/article/trump-mass-deportations-latino-voters-ec64f85e3633c9c7a8a247eaf9feb64f) as the new cornerstone his campaign in mid-August.

"See this makes more sense. They're not going to take away white rich kids who get their diagnosis because their parents can actually afford it. Its never about the diagnosis or the medications, specially with stimulants that improve performance in anyone who takes them and make big dollars for pharma companies.  Its pretense to take children away. Listen to your local elders, indigenous folks, learn about how they faced it and what they've had to struggle with to get their children and lives back. Its already happening to people pinged for fent use despite it being used in epidurals in birth, and no other long term use of it was found. They come for the lowest of the low first, and work their way up demographic by demonised demographic to get the human resources they want.  Autism is first because the 'useful' ones can mask to survive and that just exposes the 'unuseful' ones for eugenical sorting. Next will be ones super obvious with no cure such as those with Downs or Cerebal Palsey. The ones after that will be those on specialist medications that are harder to manage and cost more, such as cystic fibrosis or even cancers. They cut the funding to study those so its clear they're happy for them to suffer and die instead, they see no use in figuring out how to help them.   IMO, ADHD is more easily treated than any other neuro developmental condition.

"There’s a hypothesis to explain why ADHD exists in our society. It’s because ADHD’ers have unique traits that throughout human history has been very beneficial, especially in hunter-gatherer societies.   Distractibility is an asset in a more primitive society where you need to watch out for predators and prey, which we excel at. We offer creative and out of the box thinking. We’re explorers and entrepreneurs because we’re adventurous and our thoughts are constantly running and making connections. Also we are excellent in emergencies. That’s why we excel at careers like ER physician, EMS, firefighters, etc. Our ADHD minds gets activated in high-stress, high-pressure, fast-paced situations. That’s why it’s easier to complete a project in a short amount of time when we’ve procrastinated. We need this pressure to activate.   Now the reason it’s a disability in our modern society is because of the way our lives are structured. Working 9-5 in an office is too boring for the ADHD mind, that’s why it wanders.

Protect against any reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of the information and unauthorized uses or disclosures of the information.  It kind of does.  While the HHS is considered a “covered entity” under HIPAA, it’s still subject to the rules and regulations as such and also required to medical information rules under the National Mental Health Act of 1946, as well as individual state restrictions that may be more stringent (unless it contradicts HIPAA).

">As if Hitler came to power and immediately announced he was snuffing out all the Jewish people, effective immediately.  I mean, Hitler announced his intentions for the jews long before coming into power.  He wrote a book about it.  >They’ll say this can’t be anything like Nazis because Jews aren’t being specifically targeted. Or because the US is allied with Israel. And they’ll look at you like you’re stupid, because obviously it can’t be anything like the Holocaust if they’re not gassing Jewish people.  I think people are going to dismiss you for drawing half-baked parallels, and because no other demographic is being systematically eradicated either.  The brain is naturally attuned to recognize (or create) patterns where they don't exist  For instance, the Nazis used trains to facilitate genocide.  Therefore, if the US builds more rail lines, it must be precursor to genocide.  Yes I've heard right-wingers say this with a straight face.    And nutters all over the internet have drawn similar parallels with every other administration.  It's pretty easy if you try!    A government collecting public data on the number of people with health issues or disabilities isn't something the nazis invented, every developed nation with a halfway-decent healthcare system does it.  Like, RFK can and will harm a lot of people without it remotely approaching genocide!  It's okay to be anxious about scenarios less severe than the Holocaust!",pantsfish,2025-04-22T15:26:01,-1

We as a species have a very delicate history with the concept of a disease. For example, prior to 1973, homosexuality used to be classified as a disease. ""Hysteria"" was a ""disease"" used to dismiss women's health concerns. Even left-handedness used to be considered an illness. The things we categorize as diseases have as much to say about society as they do the mechanical differences.  I don't think it's unreasonable to make those distinctions clear.

"It's not a ""disorder/disease"", it's classified as neurological developmental disorder.  And honestly, depending on the severity, it can range from being detrimental to  even being beneficial.  It runs in my family. My son and I both have it, but we're high-functioning enough that we get a lot of the benefits, and the down sides are mostly just not understanding neurotypical social cues, expectations and communication styles.  For example, the first person I hired in my company was a ""customer support"" person so I didn't have to deal with customers - a hilariously autistic business move to minimize communication and interactions with my own customers.  It's worked great.  The fun part about being autistic and growing older is that you tend to ""find your people"" - most of my close social group are either autistic or ADHD (or both), so the neurotypical social difficulties are attenuated.",kodemizer,2025-04-22T22:20:53,2

"I would disagree to some extent; are those factors changing the kid? Probably not (we should know more in the next several years as our tech and tests for detecting autism in the womb improve). It is most likely genetic but lots of people without autism get kids with autism. There are a lot of culprits likely including things like diabetes in the mother, prenatel care, and age of the mother when having the child has long been associated with increased risk. Environmental factors play a huge role in the health of a fetus. There are a ton of culprits and environmental ones are definitely a factor but usually not the for the reason the RFK Jr types think (they want a simple ""child gets X, turns autistic) when it is more like a combination of genetic, health factors of the mother (underweight, overweight, age, diabetes, etc) including environmental factors that exacerbate some of those and exposures (air pollution has long been known to contribute to premature births which also have a higher risk of autism).  Also, there are some things like lead exposure that can increase the risk of a child developing autism (whether from in the womb or in early childhood).  The issue is we could reduce some of these factors but the vaccines cause autism types dont want to hear that since it doesn't fit their narrative of it being a ""disease"" and have an easy solution rather than a difficult one that only solves part of the issue since you are still going to have the genetic ones and the fact we test for it so much more and assign much more to the scale.",edgarapplepoe,2025-04-22T15:08:41,2

"Time to start getting creative with the DSM. Instead of diagnosing kids with autism write down a different code for the primary diagnosis that will get them the same medication and support. Anxiety and depression (with a nod and a wink) can be prescribed the same medications.  This isn't a new approach. In the old days when being homosexual was in the uncomfortable position of being illegal in many places and also a diagnosis under the DSM-1 (and until 1968 in the DSM-2) ethical psychologists would often write the ""official"" diagnosis as anxiety or depression (and to be fair being homosexual in places where it was criminal was pretty anxiety-provoking and caused a fair amount of depression), with a nod and a wink to a sympathetic psychiatrist to prescribe the right medication.   The net result was that the patient got the medication and therapy they needed while keeping it off any official record.  This isn't the first time this sort of stuff has happened. Expect a massive wave of miracle ""cures"" of autism as psychologists adjust the official diagnosis while keeping the client on precisely the same medication, just under a different diagnosis.  The problem is that RFK Jr. has already announced that he's going after anxiety and depression next. If you're a psychologist of any kind it's time to leave the USA, because RFK Jr. is going to slowly persecute anyone who has any psychological problems whatsoever, and I think it's a fair bet that physically challenged people are next on his radar.

Ms Roe really didn't like that, it's kindof a huge invasion of personal privacy, so she sued. The Supreme court decided that, yes, the 4th amendment's protection of your privacy should include details like your medical history and things of that nature, meaning that anywhere that restricted abortion on a grounds other than strict medical needs was unconstitutional.",gmano,2025-04-22T18:09:57,15

"Roe v Wade was about the right to privacy, that's the basis on which they determined that abortions before fetal viability can't be restricted -- because it's between a uterine-bearing person and their doctor, and no one else (before viability, the fetus and the carrier are for all intents and purposes the same being).  More technically, it established the idea of *substantive due process*, or basically, rights that are implied by the constitution. So things like the right to not be forced to house soldiers, freedom of religion, freedom of association, freedom from unreasonable search and seizure, and so one have a common denominator -- the right to privacy. The right is effectively there, even if it's not actually listed in so many words.  What's even worse is that Dobbs threw the entire concept into question, which has effects far beyond the right to privacy.  Did you know that the constitution doesn't actually (explicitly) guarantee the right to vote? Sure, it talks about voting and elections all over the place, but nowhere does it guarantee it to people at large, and in fact one of the amendments even says that when the ""right"" (read: eligibility, because constitutionally, rights are (supposed to be) inalienable) to vote is taken away. The closest thing to a guaranteeing of the right is the 26th amendment, which states that it cannot be denied because of age. Compare that to things like the 2nd, which uses ""shall not be abridged."" Period. The end.  Yet we have an understanding that voting is, in fact, a *right*. Why? Because of Roe.  Go read Thomas's concurrence to the Dobbs decision. He even enumerates just a handful of the multitudes of rights that are now in jeopardy because of it.",TentacledKangaroo,2025-04-22T17:48:47,16

"Fascism isn’t really a form of government like democracy or monarchy, it's better understood as an ideological shift that transforms how a government operates without necessarily changing its structure. What fascism does is take whatever system is already in place and reshape it to serve its goals. It doesn’t care if it’s a monarchy, a republic, or something else, it just uses the tools available to concentrate power and push its ultranationalist, authoritarian worldview.  It’s more about ideology than structure. Fascism centers on things like extreme nationalism, the glorification of a mythic past, suppression of dissent, and rejection of liberalism and socialism. These aren't structural blueprints for a government, they’re beliefs and values that influence how a government behaves. So instead of being its own form of government, fascism acts more like a parasite on existing ones, changing them from the inside.  It also serves an apologetic function,it gives a justification or excuse for seizing power and silencing opposition. It promises order, strength, and renewal in times of crisis, which makes it appealing to people who feel threatened or disillusioned.That’s why fascist movements often gain traction in chaotic times.   Mussolini kept the Italian monarchy intact and Hitler came to power through the democratic Weimar Republic system,same for Francisco Franco, They didn’t invent new government forms, they hijacked existing ones and turned them into authoritarian regimes fueled by fascist ideology. So calling fascism a “form of government” kind of misses the point. It’s more accurate to see it as a dangerous ideological transformation that uses whatever government exists to achieve its goals.",8bitmorals,2025-04-23T10:58:23,1

Trump has sent an innocent man to what is effectively a death camp, but *luckily* he was transferred out of there after intense pressure from his senator. Kudos to the senator there by the way. Going to El Salvador and risking it was a baller move. When confronted with the lack of due process, Trump shrugged his shoulders and said ""can't give due process to everyone.""  In a *normal* administration, this wouldn't raise too many eyebrows as long as it is done for research around prevalance of autistic traits in the population. But this administration isn't normal, so I can understand people being *fucking terrified*. When your president says ""cannot afford due process to everyone"" and your health secretary says ""autistic people do not contribute to society at all"" (contrary to all evidence), the next sentence you read shouldn't be ""said secretary will now make a list...""",BCMakoto,2025-04-22T15:59:09,5

"> Australia had one mass shooting and it changed the way you view guns. In the United States we have an avg of 2 mass shootings everyday.  Our relationship with guns is definitely different, and I think it’s because gun ownership was not constitutionally protected. We also didn’t have the same number of semi/fully automatic weapons so perpetrating a mass shooting was much harder. That made it more shocking. I was alive when that massacre happened and there were a lot of people who were angry about losing their guns but they made no trouble. There are rumours that some caches of illegal weapons exist but so far no one has used them.   And yes, I know how different the relationship between Americans and their guns is. We’ve been immersed in US culture for a long time. The MAGAs are brainwashed. It’s a cult. People in cults have given up their very lives, so some MAGAs handing over their weapons isn’t too much of a stretch of the imagination.

"This is gonna be very long; forgive me but it’s my childhood school experience and how i perceived myself because of going so long undiagnosed.   Elementary school: missing the stereotypical hyperactivity. too smart for grades to be an indicator. smart enough to complete all hw in/before class so would not indicate at home. every teacher tells me and parents “he’s so gifted but flies through everything making careless errors and is so disorganized” - Conclusion: just a smart kid who gets bored    Middle/High school: still smart enough to learn by just what is done in class, most homework assignments still able to be done at school right before time, “start” to procrastinate meaning you realize assignments are starting to become more involved and it is getting to where  it can’t only be done in school yet you still try but begin feeling like this is normal i mean everyone procrastinates right? Conclusion: boy do i have a procrastination problem, good thing i’m still smart enough to ace tests without needing to study    Last two years of high school: really started to fall apart. doing so well in every class that is still structured for the work and learning to be mainly done in class. first “college level” class in HS where the grade comes almost exclusively from work done at home, D-. I went from A’s in every class my entire life straight to a D-. through this, realize i’m struggling with maybe more than just a little procrastination. see a doctor, diagnosed with depression, put on antidepressants, sent on my way. same story with senior year except cracks are showing even more now that nearly every class is preparing me for the structure of college. but i got my answer from the doctor a year ago so surely i just need to let the medicine take its course or something. Conclusion: man was that rough, at least i caught my depression and treated it or it woulda been even worse, right? (i will say, i was definitely dealing with depression at the time too)   Freshman year of college: go in bright and doe-eyed. finally can put all my struggles of HS in the past with a fresh start. no longer feel depressed, no more meds, plan to be organized, stay on top of things, not skip classes; go in with all the hopes of being a productive student. with the excitement of everything new, i’m able to almost convince myself it’s working. but then the cracks start showing again. go to class, but don’t pay attention or take notes (tell myself i’ll be better off watching the video lecture myself). do homework but not actually “do” it myself to learn, just to get it done. realize these aren’t healthy habits but no matter how many times you tell yourself to do the studious thing, you don’t. the more the year goes on, more pressure builds and more and more executive functioning is required.   everything’s going to shit. you’re barely breathing grades-wise. unfortunately, no matter how hard you tried to quickly get assignments done just to finish them, some slipped through. you feel the mass amount of work you have to do almost literally building inside of you, yet you sit there and watch your 5th 1980s psychological thriller of the week bc for some reason you just can’t get enough of them but there hasn’t been a single second during any of those movies that you were not dreading the fact that you should be doing work.  finally, for some reason someone mentions you should look into ADHD. well that can’t be me i used to get all A’s, sit perfectly quiet, and always take my turn. those were all things the kids with REAL ADHD could never do. look into it some.   Conclusion: first psychiatrist you see checks your tests results and instantly pulls out her med sheet lmao.   all this to say, it was/is so easy for people who do not suffer from the hyperactivity aspect to go completely unnoticed for years. i remember feeling so stupid when the psychiatrist told me straight up, like it was so obvious, but it was only obvious then because everything that seemed random and not related before finally made so much sense. anyways yea wall of text over",JustHereSoImNotFined,2025-04-22T17:17:30,73

"I hadn’t heard of it being debunked, but I don’t think it’s fictional. And not having significant results does not mean a hypothesis is debunked, it means you didn’t prove your hypothesis. Plus my post is my own thoughts that I’ve formed over years of research.   Besides, I can see support for the things I mentioned IRL. And most of the things I meantioned are straight up facts. People with ADHD are more creative, think outside of the box, are more curious and adventurous (due to impulsivity). [Many entrepreneurs have ADHD.](https://www.additudemag.com/entrepreneurship-adhd-business-research-traits-stories/amp/) Many professionals recommend careers that are fast-paced and high-stress as more suitable for people with ADHD. We do function better under pressure. I also have my personal experience of many, many nights pulling all-nighters to finish a project or study for an exam. (Who am I kidding, I started the project the night before)  These are genuine strengths and not wishful thinking to make myself feel valid. Not that I need a reason to feel valid. And just like personalities, I also have many weaknesses that come with having ADHD. So I accept it as a whole, the good and the bad. This is who I am. No need to go around trying to invalidate me, I’m aware of what my reality is. Growing up with a developmental disorder is very difficult and isolating. I’ve spent half a lifetime discovering myself, I didn’t happen upon the first “feel-good” explanation. And I’m proud of it.",Mu5hroomHead,2025-04-22T16:50:16,7

"RFK Jr. doesn’t understand, because he’s never had ADHD, and sure as hell has never devoted any significant time to understanding the disease or its effect on people.  Give us a specific task at work, like ‘organize this’ or ‘create this report’, and we’ll spend 6 days procrastinating, getting distracted, and enduring analysis paralysis, only to turn in a mediocre-end result on day 7.  Put us in an internment camp, and we will have a clearly established organizational hierarchy, secret codes and communication channels, a roadmap of psychological tactics to use for subverting our captors, and have started secretly creating physical and biologic weapons for revolt, and we’ll have done this by the first afternoon.  Many people with ADHD have a few things in common:  - intense fear of underachievement and inferiority complex (owing to ‘gifted kid’ burnout and high bar for potential that is never met)  - a distinct lack of external motivation (it does not matter what you say or do, if we do not find value in it for ourselves, we will not do it.)  - deep emotional empathy (high level of sensitivity rejection, extreme social pattern matching recognition)  - God complex (it’s paradoxically how most of us cope with the inferiority complex, by believing that we can quite literally do anything, that it drowns out the negative thoughts under the surface. This is how we end up not turning in important assignments but are fluent in Mandarin despite never visiting China, or can design a 3D printer from scratch despite never taking an engineering course. It’s the only way we can redeem ourselves internally, ‘well I fucked up that assignment, but it was probably stupid assignment, I didn’t need it anyways considering I have all these cool talents instead to get by in life’)  By putting ADHD people in an internment camp, you are giving them a stage, not a prison. You’re allowing them to prove every person who ever doubted them wrong by becoming the face of the resistance. You’re taking a generation of children who are now in their 20’s and 30’s, who were raised on Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, Game of Thrones, 1984, Lord of the Flies, Hunger Games, and Stephen King, and giving them the ability to be the protagonist of their own story. They aren’t going to accept those conditions as a prison-like environment. They are going to hyper-focus on making the guard’s lives miserable. The new random talent they learn won’t just be breaking out, it will be doing it *in style*. It will be doing it *while having fun*.   Shit, you think we care about bodily harm in these camps? Half of us were esteemed athletes because excessive movement was all we were good at growing up, and the other half were so depressed we cut ourselves for fun habitually.   You think we’ll care about rationing food? We’ve been used to going to bed for years from taking stimulant medication thinking ‘did I remember to eat today?’  You think you know what it will take to take to control us? You’ll have a stable of guards born out of the status-quo, who know nothing but beating, tasing, shooting, wrestling. Our collective knowledge will outweigh yours 10,000:1, easily.  You think we won’t be able to organize? We’re a group of people who have always lived on the outside, never quite fitting in. Putting us all in a single environment together is healing a large part of our psyche’s and giving us collective motivation.  You think you can round us up in the first place? We’ve spent decades in front of monitors playing war simulators as video games, because the instant dopamine hits are one of the only things that calms us.  There’s a reason we don’t excel in ‘normal’ environments. You find us working as paramedics, as firefighters, as bartenders, as athletes, as FEMA responders, as air traffic controllers, as fighter pilots.   We can’t function in normal everyday environments, because our brain is not evolved to do so. It is evolved for rapid fight-or-flight scenarios, constantly scanning, constantly jumping from threat to threat, resource to resource, we evolved specifically to thrive in chaotic scenarios.   By rounding us up and putting us in internment camps, you are putting us back into our natural element. No corporate social structure, no rules or decorum, no expectations. Only chaos and survival. We are better built for that than your guards will ever be.   You think handcuffs, straitjackets, steel bars, barbed wire, armed guards will stop us? We already know that most of them use universal handcuff keys you can order online (and we will gladly smuggle them in. You think we don’t know how to operate drones?) We’ll drop them in from a mile away in packages of 50 that break on contact with the ground, so unless your camp has anti-air measures you’re fucked from that standpoint. You think we can’t do the same for wire cutters, or vials of acid that will eat through steel? You think we’re scared of bullets? We know that hitting a moving target at more than 20 yards is extremely difficult in the best of circumstances, let alone when they are trying to fight back and you’re dodging projectiles yourself. You think we don’t know that rope, zip ties, and straight jackets can all be escaped from relatively easily with the right technique? You think we don’t know exactly what materials are conductive, magnetic, flammable, hackable, erodable?  The only way they can make this work is if they put all of us in CECOT style maximum security prisons. Anything less, and we’re running the place within a week. We were born into a world that didn’t care for us, and it has hardened us ever since. Go ahead, try your best to break us down. There’s nothing you can do or say that will pierce us. We are some of the most mentally hardened individuals on earth; every single one of us knows that we the potential to be great, and we live our entire lives from the backseat trying to steer ourselves to do what we know we are capable of, only to fall flat and fail again, and again, and again.    We already live our lives in a mental prison, that we have to break out of every single day just to function. Putting us in a physical one isn’t containment for us. It’s a gamified escape room with an implicit high score for number of guards killed and time to escape.",techdaddykraken,2025-04-22T15:53:20,38

"Let me state your position back to you—because whether or not you realize it, the logic leads to a place that’s fundamentally anti-science.    You’re not saying science is bad. But you are saying that certain knowledge—like a comprehensive autism registry—should never be pursued, because if a future administration you view as fascist gains power, they might misuse it.    Let’s play that out: if AOC is president in 2028 and builds this registry, you’d probably support it. But if Ivanka Trump wins in 2032, and you believe she’s a fascist, then you’d argue the research should never have been done—because the findings are now dangerous. So by your logic, science should only happen if your team stays in power forever.    And layered into that is another assumption: that **career NIH researchers, independent review boards, and peer scientists wouldn’t be able to act ethically, independently, or resist distortion under bad leadership**. That’s a remarkable level of institutional distrust—for someone claiming to defend science.    So it’s not about research quality. It’s about political control. What you’ve built is a worldview where **truth itself is conditional**, and knowledge creation is too risky unless your political side is in charge.    Even if your intentions are good, the result is clear: you’re not protecting science—you’re preemptively **killing lines of inquiry** because you don’t trust the public, the system, or the future.

"Anecdotal sure, but my favorite job of all time was being a waitress in a busy restaurant. Sure, my body hurt by the end of shift, some people are absolute tools, and I had my share of crying in the walk in, but it flew by.

It felt good to juggle the orders, the tables, and the work with other staff, and I’m convinced it was like working out a muscle in my brain that is hard to target.

"Okay, but any version of events where they unify and aggravate the ADHD segment of the population would probably be a piss poor call.  Someone commented about how ADHD actually affects your world perspective and it might seem exaggerated but it's actually not.  Research into the condition has been suggesting that it's not so much of a disability as it is an evolutionary trait to have a people in your group population who are going to be good to have around in cases of major threat or disaster.  You say ""us"" so I assume you have it, so you'll know that it's not that we have an actual deficit in our ability to pay attention, it's that we have a deficit in the ability to turn our brains off and just do mind numbing routine tasks.  Which modern society values a lot, so much so that it sets that as the standard for ""normal"", but y'know it honestly shouldn't be seen as some big virtue. I know the Money class likes to have workers that plod along doing whatever they're told and don't complain, but that's a virtue in a plow horse, that doesn't mean it's actually good to try to force humans to be a fancier version of that.  Anyway the thinking is that ADHD was the adaptation that meant that SOME members of the tribal group were constantly vigilant, constantly trying to figure out how to solve actual complex problems that might come up, constantly ready to do something about it when disaster struck.  We've replaced that in modern society with police/firefighters/paramedics and so on but turns out a great many of them are ADHD individuals because we're drawn to that kind of situation, or like me, particularly, I work with animals but my ability to deal with all hell breaking loose at any given moment in animal world is what makes me good at it.  The dog tries to attack me I don't flinch back I reflexively GO STRAIGHT IN THERE TO GET HOLD OF THE DOG.  They started with fight or flight, then recently added freeze, but I think there should be one more that specifically applies to ADHD neurodivergence which is ""FIX"".  Like right now there's about a million boring regular life things I should be attending to but I am having real issues with hyperfocus on what's going down in the USA. I'm not afraid or doomscrolling, I'm analyzing the situation looking for a resolution and what the other poster said about our God complex where we think we're up to the task of dealing with INSANELY disproportional odds is very real.  Pragmatically I know that there's ""not much I can do"" but *in my heart I feel like I should be doing it anyway.*  ADHD individuals tend to exhibit extreme empathy and concern for the group well being as well.  Un-medicating and then targeting the ADHD population, and there are a significant number of us it's divergent but not uncommon, would probably be a super bad idea.  We're not aggressive but we're *conniving,* ""fear"" is something we have related to protecting other living things not ourselves for the most part, we definitely are pretty close to 100% on the ""feral"" spectrum, and if SHTF we don't think we ACT. Problem solving? We aren't just outside the box, we don't even see a box.  Having a huge shitload of us getting spicy with the situation all at the same time would likely be reminiscent of the Rorschach-in-prison scene from ""The Watchmen"".

Cheap costs don’t matter much when your reach is a significant portion of the population and almost every millennial who grew up in the 90s when it was basically just prescribed to every kid who had any bit of energy above the median for their age group. It currently has something like an annual market size of $23 billion a year and is expected to continue to increase over the next decade. They aren’t going to just give that up, there are 7 big pharma companies who produce it and as you even mentioned it’s dirt cheap from a production standpoint, has a reliable and increasing demand amongst adults, and is basically a license to print money and funds a lot of the experimental medications that pharmaceutical companies make.   Trust me on this lol I used to work for IQVIA and later Aetna/CVS, it’s a very profitable and successful product in the industry. That and there are so many other similar alternatives that it really isn’t feasible on banning Adderall without then banning a bunch of other medications that will be used as substitutes except those other medications have a wider range of uses so it would have a bunch of unnecessary negative externalities accompanying its ban.",dareftw,2025-04-23T12:06:08,2

The narrow window we did have had to be spent on getting the ACA through, which was itself extremely tough due to blue dog dems being a legit problem.  At every point, there was either a GOP president, a red house, or less than 60 Dem senators, with a rare exception of the period where Obamacare passed in 2009. And because we let Ted Kennedy's seat flip in MA of all palces after his death in early 2010, we blew that too. That was an easy race that never should've been lost after Obama gained record turnout, but hey, it turns out young activist progressive leftists don't actually vote when it matters a lot of the time because it doesn't get as much online clout, so it's easy to let important races get lost this way when bashing the Dems is more fun.  The voters have not given the Dems the power needed to codify these things ever since the Reagan revolution. Look up the makup of congress. There were always serious legislative barriers in place. The next closest we had was 57 senators in 1992, and that number dropped by 8 within 2 years, flipping the senate red.  And the filibuster has needed 60 members to end it since 1975.

The first projects received funding in 2002. Some highlights from that research are described below.  **Air pollution** – Researchers found early-life exposure to air pollution may be a risk factor for autism.  **Prenatal conditions and maternal factors** – Problems with a mother’s immune system, certain metabolic conditions, or inflammation during pregnancy may be linked with higher rates of autism diagnosis for her children.  **Metals, pesticides, and other contaminants** – Prenatal and early childhood exposure to heavy metals, like mercury, lead, or arsenic; altered levels of essential metals like zinc or manganese; pesticides; and other contaminants cause concern.",edgarapplepoe,2025-04-22T16:04:35,6
