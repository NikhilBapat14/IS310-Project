"From the Harvard Crimson:  https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/4/15/barron-harvard-palestine-trump-comply/  They shouldn’t be particularly trusted.  >   The verdict is in: Harvard will not complywith the Trump administration’s demands to end diversity, equity, and inclusion programming and further restrict campus protest. If only the University had not been carrying out a parallel campaign — of silencing dissent, prosecuting protest, and abandoning academic freedom — for the past eighteen months, maybe then the verdict would be worth celebrating; maybe then the promises from Massachusetts Hallwould not ring so hollow. Indeed, in all but name — and before being officially asked to do so — University President Alan M. Garber ’76 has already actualized many of the Trump administration’s wishes for the University. In less than one month, Harvard has pausedan academic partnership with Birzeit University after a months-long smear campaign against the West Bank institution; fired the leadership of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies in apparent response to allegations of imbalanced programming on Palestine; suspended the Religion, Conflict, and Peace Initiative at the Harvard Divinity School amidst accusations of antisemitism; let go of RCPI’s Associate Director, a Palestinian American professor; and, placed the Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee on probation without clear basis.",Kelor,2025-04-23T16:56:34,1
"Yes, but some *want to* *comply* with the Orange Clown. From the article:  >Even now, some of Harvard’s most influential donors, including Mr. Paulson and William A. Ackman, the chief executive of the hedge fund Pershing Square, believe it is a mistake to fight with the president, according to people who have been briefed on their opinions. Those people and others who spoke for this story did so on the condition of anonymity to talk about discussions that were supposed to remain private.  That's Wall St pariah and MAGA darling Bill Ackman, the hedge fund manager that got Claudine Gay fired from Harvard.",thisoneismineallmine,2025-04-23T08:19:16,7
