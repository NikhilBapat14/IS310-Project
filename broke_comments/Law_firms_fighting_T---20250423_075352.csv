"When the lawyers start lawyering this hard, you know the executive orders are less “presidential power” and more “autocrat speedrun.” Good to see the Constitution lawyering up too.",This_Sign_1133,2025-04-23T07:59:27,111

He can't get shit thru his own Congress hence all of those EOs. Even his own are getting a bit jittery the closer the mid-terms come.,SingleRefrigerator45,2025-04-23T08:27:46,29
"That’s all gonna come down to how the executive orders were worded. It can be blocked if it appears intentional. It’s clearly retaliation, it’s Trump for crying out loud, but executive orders can be worded to go around that argument unfortunately.",gygbrown,2025-04-23T07:59:27,14
"Imagine how much the shareholder is going to have to demand to account for these very dangerous precedents and the risk of uncertainties caused by them!   At any time, this administration could just pass a very goofy and very illegal executive order and then tell his very radical attorney general not to allow it. And this administration has a long-standing track record of doing very goofy things like 245% tariffs or approving the conducting of military operations over these trendy cellphone apps. And everyone has seen what they want to do with Greenland and they want these mercury back in the waterways and maybe they have had too much of it already and that's why they're doing these very unstable things that are very bad for individual interests.",postsshortcomments,2025-04-23T08:49:27,4
