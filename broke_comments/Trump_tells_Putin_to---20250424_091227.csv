"One day Trump's ego might shirvel back enough to allow him to realize he is being played by Putin every day.  Until then, this is the crap we have to deal with worldwide.",LaMarr-Bruister,2025-04-24T09:14:31,5

The end to the war should be coming any minute since trump promised to end it on day one. Sure has been a long day one.,LW_GLAZER,2025-04-24T09:22:43,2
"Putin to Trump ""You have no cards""",zoziw,2025-04-24T09:37:59,2
Trump has no leverage.    Putin is willing to sacrifice the soldiers and now that the US is withholding weapons aid it's only a matter of time before they win the war.    What incentive does Putin have to negotiate?,Searchlights,2025-04-24T09:49:49,2

Trump thought they were friends and is now realizing that Putin just used this incompetent blob to further Russia's interests.,coffee_mikado,2025-04-24T10:20:30,2
"We (most not all) are kinda getting played too. The same morons that we're cheering him on for  being an asshole to the Ukrainian president will point at this and say ""See he's being tough on Russia"".",Bruce-7891,2025-04-24T09:18:24,2
It is one long day if you look at it from the point of view that congress voted to make the remainder of this session as a single day.,pokeshack,2025-04-24T10:22:57,1
"It's strange, but the MAGA crowd will rationalize anything Trump does.  He is a womanizing bully that rose to prominence on his fathers coattails and has bankrupted 6 businesses and conned countless people everywhere, yet MAGA thinks he is the only one who ""gets it"".  What the fuck",LaMarr-Bruister,2025-04-24T09:19:54,4
"I think the vast majority of men in this country rate manliness by how rich you are, and how boisterous you are. Doesn't matter how you got your money, it doesn't matter how smart you are, doesn't matter how you treat other people or how you behave.",Bruce-7891,2025-04-24T09:43:28,3
"I have an uncle who mooched off my grandpa until his late thirties, the got married to someone who made a decent income and has mooched off of her for the past 30 years (not sure what she sees in him), yet he is always 100% somehow the victim of every self inflicted problem he has. And of course he hates the welfare nation. And of course he is MAGA.  He's not everything bad that Trump is, but in his eyes I think Trump is the successful version of himself.",roboscott3000,2025-04-24T09:55:55,2

"Sadly, I think you are spot on.",LaMarr-Bruister,2025-04-24T10:00:42,1
I suspect you are correct and Trump is what the MAGA crowd wishes they could be.,LaMarr-Bruister,2025-04-24T10:01:05,1
