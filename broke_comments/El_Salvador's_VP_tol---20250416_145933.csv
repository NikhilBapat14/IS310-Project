"The efforts of Van Hollen are admirable in their attempts to do something within the legal measure of action but it also just feels like the same result as Gotham City trying to solve its problems in the same way. We have plenty of James Gordons in our world. People that are willing to do the right thing, to do the legal thing. But when things so stacked against you, when what your facing against is so against the very power that you hold...  What we really need are the ""Batmans"" of the world.   To quote the Dark Knight Rises itself.  *""There's a point. Far out there. When the structures fail you. When the rules aren't weapons anymore, they're shackles, letting the bad get ahead. Maybe one day you'll have such a moment of crisis. And in that moment, I hope you have a friend like I did. To plunge their hands into the filth so you can keep yours clean.""*",Dapper_Eggplant,2025-04-16T15:29:28,15
"It is with deep reservation that I PAID my taxes yesterday and it sickens me to fathom that my fucking money is being used to fund actions which undermine the Constitution and blatantly disregard the Bill of Rights and the rule of law.  Sickening.  Absolute.  Clearly the Republican Administration is not honoring the oath taken on January 20, 2025 by the Republican serving - albeit questionably - as President.   Grounds for removal have never been so obvious.",Top_World_4921,2025-04-16T15:40:22,20

"The Trump administration has defied a court order and is committing a heinous crime against this man and the others who have had no due process.  They have all been sent to a death camp by the United States.  This is a another SHAMEFUL, HORRIBLE part of our country's history that no whitewashing will erase.",CouchCorrespondent,2025-04-16T15:23:04,3
"The other part of this is that he quoted Buckles in saying that they cant smuggle him into the US.  Which basically made me realize that its a roundabout way (likely to prevent pissibg trump off but also to beat around the bush so they dont run afoul of a future anti-Trump pres) of saying that Trumps admin is basically refusing to take him back. They wouldnt have to ""smuggle"" him if Trump sent a plane or if they could put him on a repatriation flight.   Now remember, the court said that the Trump admin is obligated to ""facilitate"" his return, which they are interpreting as sending a plane to pick him up. If Buckles and his VP are saying that they have to smuggle him, then that means the admin is very obviously in contempt and refusing to even send the plane.",chaos0xomega,2025-04-16T15:55:46,3

"Now that there is an institution like Harvard committed to opposition, that's a beacon of hope, but we need more of them. Every person in this country needs to take some time and seriously reflect on what will they'll be willing to do as this cabal becomes more lawless and anti-democratic. This administration is currently defying a Supreme Court because this mealy-mouthed Court refuses to state in plain, specific language what must be done. They seem committed to always giving Trump wiggle room or more power. Once the Court gets specific and this administration ignore them, what will you be willing to do?              We can no longer think of ourselves as a ""resistance""; we should now be the unabashed opposition. Peaceful protest should always be the goal, but we also have to determine how we can become disruptors. How can we punish the more powerful who remain silent or even complicit in the face of the rise of Trump's fascism? How do we punish those who've been named as part of the team of destruction that's raged through the government? They should be named everyday until they're as well known as Elon Musk. They shouldn't be doxxed, or threatened, but they should be known: https://web.archive.org/web/20250228000358/https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/27/us/politics/doge-staff-list.html                   Another thing to keep in mind is those in Trump's Cabinet people must steal enough so they never have to work again, or they have to stay in office under the Dear Leader forever because after this, they have nowhere to go in politics, or most of polite society. There's no more political career for Marco Rubio or the former members of the House who joined Trump's Cabinet, they're all-in. At some point, most of us are going to have to be all-in. What will it take for you? And you don't have to say, but you should have in mind what you're going to be willing to do if that time comes.",appmanga,2025-04-16T16:26:03,2

So a U.S. Senator went in an official capacity to find the whereabouts of his constituent. Said Senator was given verbal confession from the President of El Salvador that El Salvador is being paid by the U.S. President to human traffick a person that The U.S. Supreme Court must be returned to the U.S. (or elsewhere if you're a ring-wing nut).  Can this be used as testimony for human rights violations against El Salvador? It's not like Congress would depose the Senator for testimony for impeachment of Trump and Co.,SlimShakey29,2025-04-16T17:41:37,9

"Unfortunately, a single Senator or Congressional delegation can't actually order another government to do anything.  What they can do is go on fact-finding missions and get direct answers in a way that a Judge can't.  Because of Van Hollen's visit, I expect we'll get confirmation of answers like:  * Why are you holding him? - Because the US is paying us.  * Can we talk with him? - You may not.  * What crime is he charged with? - None.  * Has the US Embassy reached out about releasing him? - They have not.  All of which further reinforces that Trump administration officials are in contempt of court.  The government of El Salvador doesn't really care about holding this guy and would return him if the US government asked... but nobody has taken even the most basic steps to ask.",Xytak,2025-04-16T16:25:40,12
