"I wonder how many conflicts of interest laws that will break. As if it even matters.      >...[the US] IS THRIVING AND MAKING A FORTUNE!     Who is, Trump, and where? Seriously, who the fuck is thriving and making a fortune? Your family? Your billionaire cronies? Who for crap's sake!?! I think the president has had a complete and utter break with reality. It's as if he doesn't think anyone, who doesn't make at least a million year, even exists. We are nothing to him. Peasants who drain the government coffers. Lives unworthy of life because we weren't born into opulence.     I bet the Russian Trump Tower will be literally gilded from top to bottom and only affordable to the wealthiest of the wealthy. They are shoving in our faces what it's like to be grotesquely rich.  I hope whoever may speak at the Pope's funeral reiterates what the pontiff said in his Easter message and makes Trump squirm in his seat. Then Trump can bad mouth them like he did the Rev.Buddle who spoke at Carter's funeral.",invalidpassword,2025-04-22T05:24:28,12
