"They know they will be decimated in 2026.  They have already defied court orders (even from the Supreme Court).  My money is on Trump declaring some kind of drummed up ‚Äúemergency order‚Äù as an excuse to ‚Äúpostpone‚Äù the Midterms.  If the Dems are smart, they should be preparing for that possibility.  Trump never plans to leave office. This isn‚Äôt hyperbole. His actions in his first 100 days has all the hallmarks of dictatorship.  Most chillingly, Stephen Miller, Russell Vought, and many other architects of Project 2025 are embedded in the government. The FBI and the Justice Dept. are being purged and repopulated by MAGA loyalists. Schedule F will allow all government departments to be ‚Äúcleansed‚Äù of non-partisan civil servants and replaced by MAGA.  The framework of an authoritarian regime is being quickly constructed.

"Trump making third term noises may just be a ploy to keep MAGA focused on Trump. It keeps other major candidates from starting up 2028 campaigns. As soon as there are other 2028 Republican candidates out there raising money and talking to donors. Trump becomes a lame duck.

"Similar here. I've got a ton of student loans and I'm a teacher, so I was counting on the PSLF, which I would qualify for in August. I told my dad that Trump wanted to kill the Department of Education and that would end student loan forgiveness and he was all, ""He can't do that, so he won't."" Now the SAVE plan is going to be gone, and a bill was proposed that would kill student loan forgiveness entirely. I told my dad he voted against me achieving the American dream, I'll be in debt my entire life, never buy a house, and he's all, ""Well, I'll pray for you more."" Yeah, or you could have voted for the person who wanted to give first time home buyers a $25,000 down payment assistance and would keep student loan forgiveness going, but nope, she's a woman who laughs sometimes, and we can't have that.",Foobiscuit11,2025-04-20T20:07:22,25

"The eagle has a small crown with 7 stars (which does have some biblical symbolism).  The image has a missing star on the top line, which separates the first 5 from next 8, and on the 2nd line there are 11 stars.

I'd not be surprised if it were intended as some coded biblical reference to the idea that the Trump is the 2nd coming in Revelation.  Or it could just be AI generated BS and not some biblical or other reference.  The whole thing is about as creepy and weird as the idea of a Trump 3rd term.",MyStoopidStuff,2025-04-21T21:53:34,1
