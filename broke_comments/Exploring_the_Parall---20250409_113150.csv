"Hawley Smoot was an unbelievably stupid policy and exacerbated the Great Depression. And such “foot shooting” has parallels to today.  But it isn’t quite a 1:1 analogy because it didn’t cause the depression. Hawley-smoot was imposed in 1930 *after* the stock market crash. The Depression was caused by the crash, poor monetary policy, the gold standard and bank panics. Smoot Hawley came in a few months later and delivered the last knockout blow. It would be analogous to Obama in 2008 deciding “tariff the world” was a good idea right after the mortgage bond market went tits up.",BrainDamage2029,2025-04-09T21:39:21,39
Pretty sure the uncertainty and economic slide is all part of the plan. The great depression fueled fascism movements across the world. After all its hard to blame others when things are going well,AA_energizer,2025-04-10T17:38:11,7
"More like 1970s style stagflation with global decoupling, but the fiscal and debt crisis will lead to having to back down most China tariffs.   USA will lose reverse currency status and lifestyles of people living on debt in for painful!",angrybirdseller,2025-04-10T20:54:38,5
"This is a very different American economy in a very different world. Everyone knows that the Great Depression was brought on by the 1929 stock market crash and further decline due to the immense lending by the private banks to just about anyone who wanted to join the bull market. Banks had huge defaults on loans. So many businesses went bankrupt and some banks closed.. The flow of money for goods and services dried up. The Smooth Hawley tariffs exacerbated an economic catastrophe. Unemployment went through the roof. The main commonality is that business and investment confidence is going down.So many American businesses are reliant on imports for their existence. Surely inflation will rise. You only need appreciation for basic economic principles to understand the dilemma facing America. How can anyone in business plan for an unknown future of unknown demand for increasing expensive goods?  The other difficulty is that established markets will be lost, so that already the instability caused might not be able to be reversed. This is because the 90 day ceasefire for tariffs has not stopped China from entering the tariffs war with gusto. China has become such a integral trading partner for so many countries, not least America. Uncertainty depresses markets. Americaln diplomatic relations are so dependant on the perception of reliability of markets and investment, that we are now entering unknown territory. Best of luck America.",Alert_Captain3469,2025-04-17T10:18:06,1
"This post already old, gonna have to move faster than this. Things changing hourly, which is the plan. There is nothing sustainable about the pre-existing status quo. It was moving the United Stated solely in the direction of obsolescence as our previously “leadership” lack fortitude to do anything but appease everyone else ( non-Americans)",SylvanDsX,2025-04-09T20:28:34,-16
Yeah Hawley-Smoot was basically the government/economy shooting itself in the foot *after* getting shot in the chest. The Trump tariffs are like trying to cure erectile dysfunction by shooting yourself directly in the dick.,blaqsupaman,2025-04-09T22:07:43,17
"The timing is true, yet I have often seen people point at thr tariffs. Thr discussion usually goes that the tariffs were a couple years in coming. Investors knew they were in tge works, that they would probably pass, and predicted what would happen. Now the markets in the late 1920s were a house of cards just waiting for any doubts to cause it to come crashing down. But their fears of tariffs causing economic slow downs no matter what were right on the money.",SnooCalculations2363,2025-04-10T09:59:47,3

"Tariffs are fair game in measured and calculated areas to protect some critical interests in your industries, or to sustain food autonomy etc. The WTO used to be an arbiter for that stuff (had its own faults but that’s another debate). Sweeping and sudden tariff hysteria we just saw with Trump ? That crashes investment, bonds, trust, consumers… because it simply is a massive tax hike.",Brisbanoch30k,2025-04-10T15:07:25,8

"I'd say though the world in 1920s was in a fundamentally different philosophical mindset of ""Great Country/Empire"" theory. Protectionist economic policy was intrinsically tied into colonialism, empire building, economic arms race, and actual arms race. The idea that your country needed to industrialize and out economically produce your rivals so they could spread and survive. Britain included it in its quasi anthem: *Britannia, rule the waves!/ Britons never, never, never will be slaves.* ""We don't survive unless we have unquestioned naval supremacy and we won't get that without the local economic power to build such a fleet. And you see this attitude across Europe and the US too with their different sectors. They felt they needed to protect their local industries and industrial base at all costs. We know now that doesn't really work (you rob peter to pay Paul and chokepoint your raw material supply). But again, these things are tied into each other. Colonialism? Yeah you're country doesn't have enough rubber to meet production? You seize land that has rubber.   Id say the difference today is the only people who actually think and believe in this obsolete mindset is Donald J Trump and a small group of Yes men around him. With the rest of the globe only considering tariffs on a retaliatory basis in order to prevent tariffs and make sure the ones that DJT put on are short lived. Hawley-Smoot set off a wave of protectionist tariffs everyone was putting on everyone else. Its telling the response to Trump across Europe and the rest of the globe is to retaliate against the US.....but look at free trade agreements amongst themselves.",BrainDamage2029,2025-04-10T10:35:35,4
"I will agree that Trumps modeus operendi during his administrations has always been ""Rush forward with such mind blowing craziness that no one can react fast enough to stop it..."" 2016-2020 was a daily news bombing of just unbelievable stuff that should only happen in elementary school. We could not fathom how it could get worse, but it has.",SnooCalculations2363,2025-04-10T09:55:45,2
