Swatting should absolutely be a felony. It’s attempted murder by proxy.,Achmetan,2025-04-18T21:23:11,41
It is a felony. People have been sentenced to federal prison for up to 20 years in the past.,Batbuckleyourpants,2025-04-18T21:44:55,30
"I believe that some people saw Austin being stabbed and thought that maybe he put his hands on the kid, but clearly what really happened was the black kid stabbed him.",OzoneLaters,2025-04-19T00:06:42,19

"Exactly.  When the black kid stabbed him it is likely that Austin tried to block the knife but missed, making it look to some people like “he touched the black kid”.  Duh.  This guy is no victim. I have heard of Rosa Parks but there is no such thing as Razor Parks.",OzoneLaters,2025-04-19T09:45:31,5
