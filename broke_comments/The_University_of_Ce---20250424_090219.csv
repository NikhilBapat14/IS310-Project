"I know MAGA is delusional, so I really don't know...but I would imagine that doing shit like this isn't great optics and doesn't help the next MAGA candidate win Florida.  But like I said I don't know...they'll probably win by more next election.",wirsteve,2025-04-24T09:06:51,7

Wow campus police are collaborating with ICE. Universities are actively working to deport their own students.  This seems to go against the sort of environment Universities are supposed to provide and also seems incredibly foolish. International students are profitable. Convincing them to stay away will hurt the entire university funding model.    https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/florida-universities-signing-287-g-ice-agreement-a-list-22927663,BeowulfShaeffer,2025-04-24T09:44:41,2
"Poor optics for anyone who cares about the rule of law, international relations, attracting a pool of scientific and creative talent towards American research and industry, etc....   That all seems on brand for MAGA ideologues! More red meat to chew on while everything backslides.",omnomnominal,2025-04-24T11:27:53,2
The problems is they have full controls of both parties. I had wanted to starve them to force them to cut more stuff out and start lowering tuition costs but nope.,Humble-Emphasis5982,2025-04-24T11:43:14,1
