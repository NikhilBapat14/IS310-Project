Unconstitutional as fuck.,Rider-VPG,2025-04-19T10:13:58,81
"Blatently uncomstitutional, several of the things they are banning with this were already overturned by SCOTUS.",ultrainstict,2025-04-19T09:22:50,98
"From his campaign ads.  ""My opponent is accusing me of promoting a radical Leftist gun control agenda. That is a lie. I like hunting, and respect the long tradition of Colorado citizens of owning guns.""  Voting for Democrat?  Not even ONCE.",me_too_999,2025-04-19T11:15:21,87
"So glad the GOP cares about the 2A and has expanded, or even talked about expanding, gun rights in this country while they have a majority.",Chris0nllyn,2025-04-19T09:04:34,44
The Democrats keep pushing their agenda wherever they still have power.  It doesn't matter what's happening federally.  They really are the enemy of the American people.,JediGeek,2025-04-19T09:20:51,63
"""Starting in August 2026, the manufacture, sale and purchase of certain semiautomatic firearms that can accept detachable ammunition magazines will be outlawed in Colorado.   That will include AR-15 and AK-47 rifles, as well as a long list of their popular variants. Senate Bill 3 will also affect tactical shotguns and a small number of handguns.  The banned weapons would only be available for purchase to anyone who is otherwise allowed to purchase a gun if they have a magazine with a maximum capacity of 15 rounds that is welded, epoxied or soldered on. Right now, those kinds of weapons are rarely made.   The bill also immediately bans so-called rapid-fire trigger devices, like bump stocks, which can make a semiautomatic weapon fire at a rate similar to that of an automatic gun.""",Ironman650,2025-04-19T08:25:59,31

"It's really starting to suck being a Conservative in Colorado.  It'd be hell to try to rebuild my business somewhere else, though. Plus my whole family is here :-/  Really need more Conservatives to move BACK here so we can overwhelm those damned idiots in Denver and Boulder. I know Florida and all is tempting... but this place used to be red, too, dang it.",Swiftbow1,2025-04-20T03:24:34,3
A little surprised Polis did this. He’s one of the more idealogical flexible and ultimately pragmatic Democrat governors.,Unlucky-Prize,2025-04-19T12:44:10,0
"Many IL citizens agree that it will be in front of SCOTUS, but (as they found out with PICA) not much action will happen.",bjohn15151515,2025-04-22T21:38:45,1

They try to go around democracy and the constitution every day. Because they can't get their mass immigration agenda passed by congress they use the executive to ignore the law and then the judicial to stop any hope of fixing it. All of that without passing any new law.,kaytin911,2025-04-19T11:40:50,2

 Because that’ll for sure stop the bad guys from getting guns and bring down murder rates. It’s worked before…..right? Right guys??? /s,ITrCool,2025-04-19T08:46:11,34
"Is the August 2026 date normal or timed so when it is overturned as unconstitutional, it can be used as a political point during the midterms?",pcm2a,2025-04-19T10:40:32,10
"I think they might not be able to challenge it until it goes into effect and has actually prevented someone from being able to buy a gun. I'm kinda wondering if I can drive to Colorado to buy a long gun that's legal where I live (aka all of them), get denied, and hop on the class action.",Mountain_Man_88,2025-04-19T09:58:09,18
The guys doing all the killing aren't buying their weapons legally.,WishboneEnough3160,2025-04-19T10:33:40,13
