"Remember that Government is just people. (the people who are in government,. are citizens just like anyone else).   As someone who's worked in small city governments for the past 20 years or so,... for all the faults of Government internal processes,..the 1 thing we run up against the most often is:  * Everyone wants something different. (IE - You can't please everyone or every interest group)   You see it all the time in many different topic areas:  * People want better cellular service.. but nobody wants cell-towers in their neighborhood.   * An area of land becomes available.. all of a sudden you've got 2 to 5 different ""citizen interest groups"" arguing about what should go on that land (some want Housing, some want Natural areas, some want a new Stadium,. etc etc)   * Look at some areas of the country that have ""U+2"" type laws (where a House cannot have to many people living in it). Younger groups like Students etc often want ""U+2"" repealed because it makes it hard to live independently if you can't afford housing on your own. But many older folks like ""U+2"" because it stops ""college frat party house"" type situations from getting out of hand.   Everybody wants newer and better stuff,. but nobody wants it to sacrifice anything to get it.  EDIT for clarity,.... to tie this into the question of ""logic over greed"".. I was just trying to make the point that sometimes the ""logical solution"" may not be achievable, especially because Humans are not always logical. Even if it's something that on the surface seems easy like ""Our city has grown so much that we need to add a 2nd Water Sanitation plant"". OK,. that seems pretty straight forward,. unless or until you start trying to figure out where to build it and how to allocate budget money to it. Then things start to get much more difficult. Might take 10 years to get that built. Then because it took so long, you have people complaining asking why it took so long. A lot of times in Government,. no matter what the Government ends up achieving,.. you'll still have some slice of the demographic somewhere that's unhappy with what you did.",jmnugent,2025-04-09T15:50:32,30

"The technocratic discussions always miss something fundamental about politics: Technocrats are generally good at determining how to reach a goal, but they're not experts in *what goals to achieve,* nor how to balance competing interests.  For instance, Google Maps is expert at telling you how to get from A to B. But it doesn't know anything about what B ought to be. It can tell you the best time to leave to minimize traffic, but can't balance things like if you'd like to sleep later, or arrive with more time at your destination. It doesn't know how many stops the passengers will want to make, how to decide if a certain detour to another spot is worthwhile, or whether you should take the scenic route.  The executive agencies have generally been pretty good on executing policy, but they're not the experts on what the policy ought to be. That's the politicians' job.",bl1y,2025-04-09T16:08:15,20

"Maybe I am too idealistic here, but a thorough and intentional comprehensive plan process seems like an important place to start? That coupled with transparent and proactive communication from local government.   I live in a rural area in upstate central NY, specifically in the only city in my county (though that designation is precarious given population size). I’m involved in the very early stages of a comprehensive planning process for the nearby town. In just about a month, we were able to get close to 300 survey responses (for reference population of town is 1459). Meanwhile, the city is in severe fiscal distress and there’s quite a bit of uncertainty and concern, with city government being anything but communicative about how we will come out of it.    It’s important to note that the town and city are deeply intertwined. So what happens in one influences the other and vice versa. Local government of the town appears to be more open to community input, while the city is unequivocally not.   I’m walking a very fine line here but I’m building momentum with the town via the comp plan, while organizing community members in the city to become better educated about the fiscal situation and more collaborative about what we want to see. Of course city government in place now may not listen or care, but we are building toward a city council election in November and thinking proactively about the kind of administration we want to see in two years when the mayoral race happens.   The road is long and I’m not sure it answers OPs question directly. TL;DR - meaningful, intentional, community engagement in planning.",RhymesWithAccordion,2025-04-12T05:41:55,2
"I don’t think you can build a completely “logic-over-greed” government from scratch—power always finds a way in. But I \*do\* think we can add rot-resistant elements into our current structure. Not a total rewrite—just smart retrofits that make it harder for bad actors to do damage quietly.  Here’s where I’d start:  \- \*\*Campaign finance transparency and strict limits.\*\* End dark money. [Transparency International](https://knowledgehub.transparency.org/assets/uploads/helpdesk/Limits-on-political-donations_global-practice-and-effectiveness_final.pdf) has found that countries with tighter limits and mandatory disclosures around political donations see less corruption and greater public trust.  \- \*\*Public financing of elections.\*\* Stop making politicians dependent on donors. The [Brennan Center for Justice](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/more-combating-corruption-other-benefits-public-financing) shows that public financing systems—like NYC’s matching funds program—help reduce the influence of wealthy donors, promote more diverse candidates, and improve voter confidence.  \- \*\*Mandatory conflict of interest disclosures.\*\* No more backdoor enrichment. The [Open Government Partnership](https://www.opengovpartnership.org/open-gov-guide/anti-corruption-political-finance/) emphasizes that mandatory, public conflict-of-interest disclosures are a key tool in preventing self-dealing and maintaining institutional legitimacy.  \- \*\*Real whistleblower protections.\*\* Plus fully independent Inspectors General. According to the [Open Government Partnership](https://www.opengovpartnership.org/open-gov-guide/anti-corruption-political-finance/), whistleblower protections and strong, politically insulated oversight bodies are among the most effective mechanisms for uncovering and deterring corruption.",Kei_the_gamer,2025-04-12T08:12:08,2

"The second suggestion is basically China IMO. Whatever else you can say about them, the people running the show there are generally smart, educated, experienced, and reached positions of power by rising through the ranks and proving themselves at lower levels first.  I’m not saying it’s better or greed-free, but I do think it’s generally less greedy/corrupt these days than most Western countries (or at least the U.S.) and definitely does not suffer from the short-termism problems.  I mean this is a country that has very few qualms about locking up or even executing political and business elites if they try to game the system. The state has actual control there. Whether the Party uses it for the general social good (as they claim) or their own power (as critics claim) is a matter of debate.  I think China ultimately raises the classic question of stability versus freedom. I wouldn’t necessarily want to live under a system like that myself, especially as a generally free-thinking Jewish person (those two traits tend to correlate with support for free, open, tolerant societies).  But sometimes when I look at the the specific flaws of the system we live under in the West - rampant corruption legalized through lobbying, revolving doors, and insider trading; crippling policy instability caused by short election cycles; total government impotency in actually reigning in the excesses of the elite - I do feel a little jealous of the positive aspects of Chinese governance.",seen-in-the-skylight,2025-04-09T17:12:31,2

"All government types not based on subjugation are plausible arrangements that work. The problem is people get involved and eventually incompetence or malice will corrupt the system. There’s no reason a dictator cannot be benevolent nor a king a graceful ruler.  There are highly centralized governments and highly decentralized governments. The broad difference between them is how quickly they can react. The more centralized, the fast it can move. That means toward both good or bad though, it’s all about who’s running it.  Democracy, as we understand it in America is somewhere on the decentralized end of the scale, in my opinion. Thus, we turn the ship pretty slowly. The issue is that we’ve allowed the ship to turn toward corruption for decades… that’ll be hard to overcome given our current system.  So how do we inject logic? We need to start cultivating an environment that incentivizes it. That’ll take many very smart people a very long time to accomplish. I hope we can do it, but I have doubts.

">Decentralized governance to reduce manipulation opportunities.  Yes. Increase the size of congress.  >Technocratic oversight where experts guide policy based on evidence.  Obviously having experts running things is beneficial. I'm not sure how we could mandate it though. Would we require certain degrees? How would we ensure that these programs were granting program seats and grades without discrimination?  >Digital democracy platforms for citizen involvement in real-time policymaking.  This conflicts with your last statement. Do we want experts making decisions or do we want joe schmo? Generally I think most of the government decisions made require real knowledge and experience.

"Citizens wanting that.  Government is only as good as those it governs.  You can't legislate morality.  Decentralization then abandons the economical advantages of scale - each locality would have to finance their own cancer research, e.g.  MANY things like that just aren't feasible without a centralized organization of some kind.  It also tends to create larger differences between ""localities,"" or whatever you want to call them.  One of the things a centralized government does is smooth a lot of that out for a more consistent outcome nation-wide.  Our Executive branch has served as the technocratic oversight.  But there is nothing anyone can do when expertise is ignored in favor of hate, greed, and power.  The reason we have a representative government is because citizens do not have the time or expertise to weigh in on everything - that's what we pay our congress and executive branch for.  Or, used to.  Ask 100n people their opinions, and you'll get 200 opinions.  I have learned this by way of agency rule-making via federal register noticing and responding to each and every public comment.........lol  I am all for education reforms along the lines of what you suggest, but we would need a centralized governing body to ensure that happens.  Ensure funding.  Then, qualified teachers to ensure it's taught and taught accurately and consistently.  Starts getting sticky in the details.  How do you teach critical thinking to a religious zealot, e.g.?  I think the biggest lesson BY FAR from the last decade or two, is that we need to get money the hell out of our politics.  I would argue a subsidized campaign of limited time - I think the UK has a system like this.  Term limits, but longer terms.  Get rid of the damn electoral college.  STRICT separation of church and state - codify it.  I have long argued that some sort of framework for legislation be developed - something like LEAN SixSigma, with tollgates to ensure data-driven decisions.  Have an independent agency or office facilitate that process.  This could limit the impact of lobbyists significantly.  I propose a demerit system for elected officials lying.  Add a rule to each congress that any elected official publicly repeating inaccurate information anywhere anytime during that congress/term/year whatever, without publicly correcting it themselves w/in say 48 hours of them being informed of their inaccurate statement, will result in them being publicly corrected and get them a demerit.   5 demerits gets you censured. 7 gets you removed from your committee assignments/requires additional signatures to approve your decisions or something, and 10 gets you fired.  Period.  Maybe demerit appeals would be handled by a randomly selected anonymous group of federal judges or something?  Facts are determined to be facts when overwhelming evidence supports/proves it, and it is accepted as such by the vast majority of people knowledgeable in such matters or something - point is, define a standard by which everyone agrees to in order to determine what a fact is.    Otherwise it must be repeated as a ""theory,"" ""guess,"" or religious belief - NOT as a fact. Anything else has to be categorized accurately as well. Maybe apply the same standards the Bar applies to it's attorney members in court regarding characterizing things there?

"Anyone can do the “politician’s job”, even technocrats. There are no inherent qualifications or intellectual requirements to be a politician other than obtaining a certain amount of votes. I’m sure technical experts are perfectly capable of conducting thorough research on a matter, say toxic chemicals within the water supply, and determining that policy should dictate that it’s not okay for people to drink toxic chemicals in the water supply. Ergo, efforts should be taken to minimize or eliminate the chemical from the water supply.  That said, I don’t think the issue with technocratic systems is that they are unable to do the “politician’s job” of deciding what policies to implement and adhere to. I think that the system can become too narrowly focused on objectivity to the detriment of the human factor (like understanding the need to balance competing interests that are guided by personal principles and beliefs).

Used correctly, they help ensure extraordinary measures don’t quietly become permanent policy—a concern well-documented by legal scholars and civil liberties groups.  \- \*\*Constitutional right to information access.\*\* The people can’t hold power accountable in the dark. The [Open Government Partnership](https://www.opengovpartnership.org/open-gov-guide/anti-corruption-political-finance/) lists access-to-information laws as a foundational pillar of transparency, with real-world success in exposing misuse of funds and government abuse.  \- \*\*A national participation platform.\*\* Not to govern, but to push priorities into public view. [Taiwan’s vTaiwan project](https://vtaiwan.tw/) has become a global case study in digital democracy—successfully engaging citizens in real policy deliberation while preventing polarization and decision paralysis.  \- \*\*Term limits for Congress.\*\* Career politicians \*become\* the system. While not universally adopted, term limits have been shown in U.S. state legislatures to increase turnover and reduce entrenched power structures. Support for congressional limits remains strong among voters and reform groups.  \- \*\*No lifetime appointments.\*\* 18-year, staggered terms for federal judges. Lifetime seats were designed for a very different political era. Today, they’ve turned into long-term partisan battles with massive stakes. Fixed terms would reduce strategic retirements, ease confirmation wars, and ensure a more predictable rotation of justices. The [Brennan Center for Justice](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/why-term-limits-supreme-court-justices-make-sense) argues that staggered 18-year terms for Supreme Court justices would help restore public trust and lower the political temperature around judicial appointments.  \- \*\*Mandate civics, media literacy, and systems thinking in schools.\*\* Build long-term democratic resilience. The [Open Government Partnership](https://www.opengovpartnership.org/open-gov-guide/anti-corruption-political-finance/) argues that civic education is key to empowering citizens to critically engage with public institutions and hold them accountable.  \- \*\*Decentralize where it makes sense, but with strong federal minimums for equity and rights.\*\* The best federal systems balance local autonomy with national standards. Research on intergovernmental systems shows that decentralization \*with guardrails\* encourages innovation without sacrificing equity or oversight.  \- \*\*Make every vote count.\*\* Ranked choice or something similar—first-past-the-post is outdated. Groups like [FairVote](https://fairvote.org/rcv-benefits/) and data from Maine and NYC show ranked-choice voting reduces negative campaigning, increases majority support, and gives voters more real choice.  \- \*\*Lock-in protections against self-dealing.\*\* Reforms like these should not be reversible by a simple majority of Congress. Instead, their removal would require both a supermajority vote \*and\* direct approval from the voting public—ideally through referenda. This kind of structure already exists in several democracies: for example, [Iceland’s 2011 constitutional draft](https://www.icelandreview.com/news/icelanders-vote-yes-on-new-constitution/) included public approval for future changes, and many U.S. state constitutions require voter approval to modify ethics or campaign finance laws. The principle is simple: \*\*Congress shouldn’t be allowed to quietly undo anti-corruption laws behind closed doors\*\*. If you're voting to remove guardrails, the people should get a veto.  These aren’t really silver bullets. But layered together? I think they’d make it harder for rot to spread—and a hell of a lot easier for regular people to hold power accountable. I’ve tried to link to the studies or examples I know about, but it’s probably not exhaustive. Also, sorry it’s so long—I already tend to over-type, and this is probably my least succinct post to date.",Kei_the_gamer,2025-04-12T08:13:07,1
"To implement this would mean to get kids and parents excited about school, especially math(calculus and higher) and science. I think it’s feasible, implementation is the hard part but I’m just one guy if the government pours resources into it shouldn’t be hard. Also this would be for the next generation or the one after, and due to our biology most people can’t think beyond a couple years. It takes a vast knowledge of world history and human progress to understand things on a grander scale. That’s why I think math and science might be a good starting off point to get people to look at larger time scales or models, you acquire those skills within the mentioned fields then transfer them over when looking at history, then apply that knowledge to the current situation",Intelligent-Sound-85,2025-04-09T15:27:20,3
"Our constitution was written back in the days of knee breeches and mercury-based facial powder for men.  It's not only dated, it was a kludge to begin with.  To the extent that the US functions as a country, it functions more in spite of the constitution than because of it.  I'd advocate for an all new one, and lately a lot of Europeans are saying that we ought to, but we should be careful what we wish for:  with how divided and vehement the electorate is, chances are we'd grind out something even worse.",ColossusOfChoads,2025-04-10T04:53:02,4

The way it’s set up now encourages greed—as written the only federal officials that the populace voted for were representatives. When that was changed to add senators and POTUS/VPOTUS is when the idiocy started.     IE the claim of the Senate as a Millionaire’s Club falls flat when you look at the numbers—the number of millionaires present *rapidly* increased after they were elected via popular vote.,DanforthWhitcomb_,2025-04-09T16:31:16,-1

Greedy people will learn to slip the harness no matter what system you design. The only way to make a system that is immune to corruption is to make a system that takes human judgment out of the equation all together. Automate all governance under a one world government. But even them you would also need that AI to have the monopoly on force in order to enforce its governance. But then at that point human beings no longer have autonomy as a civilization.    So the answer is that the only way to prevent corruption is to remove human will. ,NepheliLouxWarrior,2025-04-09T18:12:26,0

"The AI we have today would not be capable of doing the things you’re talking about on such the massive scale we’d need it for (with the AI we have today, simply programming it to make wise decisions doesn’t mean it would make wise decisions). And the kind of AI we’d need for that—AGI, capable of a greater ability to understand and apply knowledge not just carry out narrow tasks—is the same kind of AI people are afraid of developing.   But yes, if we were to develop such an AI, it would be capable of making such decisions. But then you’d still run into the same issue of revolving around the prioritization of data and objectivity over the subjective beliefs of everyday people.  You could design safeguards like the one you mentioned (can’t cause harm to humans). However, if this advanced AGI is given the duty to administrate and govern, it could easily interpret that command differently from its human designers.",Princeps_Aurelianus,2025-04-11T12:44:50,2
