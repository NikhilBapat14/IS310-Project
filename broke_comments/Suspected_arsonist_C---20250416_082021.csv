"When this story broke, Reddit used its always stellar intuition to deduce that this guy was a Trump supporter. Top comments in every thread were suggesting sending this gentleman to El Salvador.  Is the energy from Redditors still there for that?",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-16T13:09:11,3
">Balmer was out on bail for a simple assault charge at the time of the attack — accused of stomping on his 10-year-old son’s broken leg and battering his estranged wife, according to a police report.  Surprise surprise, soft on crime Democrats let this psycho out of jail. Maybe they’ll learn their lesson. Most likely not",BlackScienceManTyson,2025-04-17T04:02:00,5

Yeah I noticed that too. Not that far off from Kilmar Abrego Garcia now that it just came out that he used to [beat his wife](https://nypost.com/2025/04/16/us-news/alleged-ms-13-member-kilmar-abrego-garcia-who-was-deported-by-trump-admin-accused-of-physically-abusing-wife-in-2021/).

Pretty much confirmed when mainstream outlets didn't post about a deranged republican doing it. Just like when there is an attack of some sort and they don't mention the suspect's race. It's pretty sad when you can learn as much about a story by what they *don't* say.,Rush2201,2025-04-16T18:02:11,2
