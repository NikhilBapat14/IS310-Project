"Unfortunately this will make the “governments of the world are trying to replace masculine white men” philosobro crowd work even harder to convince people that scientists and doctors and historians and economists and secularist progressive evolutionists are up against the ropes so now the establishment acandemic Bolshevists are providing a counter narrative to alt right reality which is the pure reality.  Y’all don’t know how hard Peterson and Rogan and Tate and Prager and Shapiro and a whole slew of judeochristian Westerner civilization apologists have screwed us by courting the incredulous.  It’s a very lucrative grift, but it’s a very dangerous one too.",LuvKrahft,2025-04-24T10:52:27,10

"Maybe they could try educating some pediatricians a bit more on the efficacy and safety of the covid vaccines.  I have had two pediatricians, one in MI and the other in FL, tell a family member and friend that their kids did not need the covid vaccines bc it's not that bad in kids.  This is after one of these kids had a loss of taste and smell with covid, which means they had brain damage. And, apparently the whole herd immunity thing where they are less likely to infect Grandma and the immune-compromised doesn't count with covid, just the flu?  Bc both recommended the flu shot.  The doctor in FL even went so far as to tell the parent the mRNA vaccine could cause heart area inflammation while all meta analysis studies have shown the risk to teenage and young men for this is higher while actually getting covid than an mRNA shot.  Another meta analysis had even just come out last summer when he stated this.  He did not bring up Novavax as an alternative, either.  And GP's are woefully underprescribing Novavax for people at high-risk.  Studies have come out that have shown this.  I have one friend with 5 comorbidities whose doctor did not prescribe it when they were sick bc ""it was too new.""  But back during Delta when the same friend's husband was sick, this doctor gave him Ivermectin, which had been conclusively proven to not work by that time.  The information that front-line doctors both have and share about Covid is woefully bad.  It is only going to get worse as the Guardian reported off a Politico article the other day that Bobby , Jr. had not made a decision as to whether to keep covid vaccines on the recommended childhood vaccine list.  That guy has such a hard on against covid vaccines, it is remarkable.  If mRNA's make anyone uncomfortable, just get Novavax.",koi-lotus-water-pond,2025-04-24T12:46:58,1
