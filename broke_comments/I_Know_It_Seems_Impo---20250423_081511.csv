"Generations vary from family to family. Some families that have a tendency to have kids young and would have to go back a greater number of generations in their family to talk to somebody with those kinds of memories. My family is different because, at least in recent generations, we've gotten married later in life. I'm one of the older millennials, and my grandparents were born in the 1910s. Different families can also have different life expectancies.  Some families are prone to certain conditions, like heart disease or cancer, or have heavy drinking and smoking habits that shorten their lives, and they consider themselves lucky if they live to their 60s or 70s. My family members often live to about 80 or 90 something.  It can change the things you hear from people with living memory. It also depends on the relationships involved. Some people have better relationships with family members than others, some are more present in the lives of younger generations, some are completely absent, and other people aren't very talkative about the past, especially if it was a bad experience for them. There can be a lot of factors involved.  You'd think that, even if people didn't hear this stuff from grandparents, they'd get it in schools or from books or something, but some people are almost completely impervious to these influences.

"> The FDA is a good and worthwhile thing. It's just also worth remembering how badly labor was treated back then (and still to this day)  On a side note, one of the consequences of the food safety, and labor regulations of the early 20th century there was a period of time around the middle of it when meatpacking work was considered a solid middle class job with pay, benefits, and union protections comparable to other manufacturing industry work. Then the 1980s hit and we rolled shit back to what it was way back when with a labor force of questionable skills, and legality, 0 benefits, shit pay, and child labor being utilized...   Oh, and we've also consolidated industry, and markets in a way that things like local butchershops are a thing of the past, and practically every cut of meat comes form one of a handful of plant owned by like two corporations. Something which also harms ranchers, and other producers too as those large operators set the price they want to pay be it directly, or through middlemen... and also set the prices at the store because there is no national scale competition to undercut them.
