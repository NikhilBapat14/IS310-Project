Talk about offering a bandaid for a gaping chest wound …  The issue is that we’re stuck in an economy that all but requires us to have both parents working now. Fix the economy so that you can realistically live comfortably with a single income and this issue goes away overnight.,deadzip10,2025-04-23T00:11:15,475
"$5k would be nice - but it’s not a long term solution. The immediate shock of a labor & delivery bill is one thing, then there’s the actual cost over 18-20 years of raising children. You have businesses that are not very family friendly now in terms of work/life balance. Childcare is a complete rip off for what you pay for it. ",getupkid1986,2025-04-22T22:35:09,255
"Birth rates are declining globally, actually. Russia and China both are experiencing the same issue. Both face SEVERE population implosions in the coming years due to massive generational gaps and imbalances.  This is definitely a global issue.",ITrCool,2025-04-23T07:09:34,23
Why not just up increase the availability/size of childcare tax credits?,therin_88,2025-04-23T02:33:59,46
I can't belive he's considering this. It's a terrible idea. Imagine the people who would do this for money.,tuvda,2025-04-23T11:18:14,17
Another handout? Is the plan to out lib the libs now?   What if the Federal Government just didn't spend over $100k per year per taxpayer?,AccidentProneSam,2025-04-22T22:34:40,209
Could just pay for the delivery and recovery. Probably more expensive but hey it would actually make child birth a little less painful. Not free healthcare but at least would insure that people wouldn't abuse the system and it wouldn't pay bad parents to have more children. You know just like that other system that incentivises having children and gets abused and the kids end up the worst for it.,Katzchen12,2025-04-22T22:21:01,68

"$5,000 isn't going to do anything but incentivize the lowest common denominators of society, and welfare spending will go up as a result.  I'm not sure what the solution is, but there are a lot of issues causing people to not have kids anymore. Feminism convinced women to pursue a career instead of a family, people can't be bothered with the burden of a child, several factors have turned sex into a commodity and a tool of hedonism, and our poor collective health makes it so many who want to conceive unable. The root cause of much of it is selfishness. I mean, do what you want with your life, far be it from me to be the authority on it. But many would rather have money, free time, and be able to do whatever they please. They aren't here for anything bigger than themselves.",the_house_from_up,2025-04-22T23:58:11,64
"Pretty weak gesture in my opinion. How about eliminating no-fault divorce for starters? Or, I don't know, making it possible for the one-income family to be able to afford a home again. Those two things alone would put a major dent into the birthrate.",TheConvincingSavant,2025-04-23T10:09:44,6
Better than many other ways we spend money. I also don't think we can deregulate/tax-cut our way out of the birth rate issue.,6WorkAccount9,2025-04-22T22:05:47,-28
I’m actually fine with this as long as we ban anyone from receiving that money if they’ve ever been on welfare. We have even welfare queens and lazy millennials/gen z already ruining the country. Only people who can PROVIDE should be incentivized.,BecauseTheTruthHurts,2025-04-23T01:02:37,-46

"So many employers are hostile to mothers needing time to care for a sick child, nevermind pregnancy and lack of maternity leave. The job market is tough enough these days so it adds insult to injury.",Dry-Imagination7793,2025-04-23T06:23:29,73
Entire hospital stay for my wife was $200. I don’t know what kind of jobs y’all have with terrible insurance but find a new one. My insurance isn’t great btw it’s mediocre at best.,Cbpowned,2025-04-23T09:35:23,-2

Strange how when women entered the workforce wages went down; it’s almost like when you double the labor pool it increases supply.,Cbpowned,2025-04-23T09:34:31,-9
"You promote a healthy economy. At the moment, the US economy doesn’t produce things. You hear admissions of this all the time when they talk about the US having “evolved” into a service economy. The middle class in this country was created by our manufacturing sector and functionally destroyed as the manufacturing sector was destroyed. The tariffs are actually just about the only way to fix this but it will involve a lot of short maybe even medium term pain to fix this. At the same time, you have to stop printing money and running deficits (which is just another form of printing money at this point). Over time, you’ll actually see deflation occur and as that happens, you’ll naturally see purchasing power return to the dollar and by extension the functional ability to live on a single income gradually return. I would add that it would help a lot if somewhere in there we returned to the gold or even a silver standard but that’s a longer conversation. I do want to emphasize this is a very simplified version of this explanation and there’s a ton of reasoning behind all of this that simply doesn’t lend itself to an Internet forum like Reddit but this is the broad strokes.",deadzip10,2025-04-23T07:06:25,-23
Really we would need to effectively ban women from the workforce again going back to like the 50s.  The problem is 2 people will always earn more than 1 person on average so even if we could drastically lower the cost of living (nuclear power would help a lot) people will still be strongly encouraged to have both parents working to afford a better nicer life over single income families which will tend to be outcompeted and priced out as the rat race carries on.,s1lentchaos,2025-04-23T07:59:03,-28

"I’ve had Blue Cross Blue Shield and now Cigna. I wasn’t informed by Blue Cross Blue Shield that they had to be informed within 90 days that my wife gave birth (even though they were receiving tons of claims for pregnancy check-ups). Since I didn’t do that on my last child, they tried to stick us with $3k bill for the entire post-natal care. This was 7 years ago and I didn’t pay a dime. ",getupkid1986,2025-04-23T09:51:46,8

Yeah but when you cut the labor pool in half you also cut productivity and GDP,MacadamiaMinded,2025-04-23T17:33:21,9
"That’s a supply side solution (that will never happen) a better approach would be a demand side solution. Increase the demand for workers, this is a solution that could actually be implemented with policy. Bring back manufacturing for one. Cut h1b visas way down. Do everything you can to incentivize and in some cases require companies to hire American, and most importantly, support and encourage small business instead of punishing them.",ColumbusJewBlackets,2025-04-23T08:28:22,4
"Most people spend every penny they earn.  We can increase their standard of living by driving up wages and lower the cost of living, but people will still choose to have 2 incomes because that can be used to raise their standard of living further than 1 income.  People on average will choose the nicer house, car, and pile of crap every single time over just living with less.  Pandoras box of living with dual incomes has been opened, and there's not really anything practical we can do to stop it.",s1lentchaos,2025-04-23T08:37:20,7
