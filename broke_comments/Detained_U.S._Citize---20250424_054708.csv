"“Ultimately, while Hermosillo managed to secure his release, his account is a horror story of how quickly someone can be detained on the suspicion of being an undocumented immigrant, and how the government will even lie to keep someone in detention. The Trump administration is staunchly resisting any kind of legal safeguard to protect the rights of immigrants or those mistakenly detained, blatantly denying people the right of due process.”",SmartWonderWoman,2025-04-24T07:23:56,325

"I'm going to file this under ""Be careful who you elect because others will emulate their behavior.""  I'll assume that most folks that frequent this sub have some level of education in politics or political science and are already aware of the well-known fact that people in a democracy tend to emulate the behavior of their chosen leaders.  It's why we have long thought that integrity and honesty, regardless of specific political or social beliefs, are very important when choosing leaders.  Based on the propensity of our current President to play fast and loose with truth and facts, and the talent for hyperbolic spin by the MAGA propaganda machine that informs him, it should be no surprise that those who are doing his bidding have adopted the same morality, that of ""I'm doing the Presidents work so it's ok to lie, in fact it's patriotic as I execute OUR mission.""  So, kids, once again we are reminded to be careful what you vote for because the consequences reach far beyond just that office.  Of course, all the informed and educated folks here most likely already know that we are living in a time when politics is boiled down to just one or two issues that have nothing to do with the future of mankind or the country, just that one thing that sounds ""icky"" or fits some preconceived notion in the voter's head.",oldbastardbob,2025-04-24T12:29:32,3

If there was no due process, then he would have been like that other guy and got put on a plane and deported to wherever...he didn't, he was released after proving he wasn't illegal.

"It’s simple—but not always that simple.  Whether or not you have to engage with the police depends on where you are—**public** space or **private property** (like your home). If you're out walking and it’s a *consensual encounter*, just keep walking. Don’t acknowledge them, don’t engage.  # What is a consensual encounter?  It’s when the police approach and ask you questions without detaining you. At this point, they’re likely fishing for **reasonable suspicion** to justify a detention. You are under **no legal obligation** to talk or stay. But if they decide to detain you as you walk away—**start recording immediately** or ask someone nearby to record. As soon as possible, **invoke your Fifth Amendment rights** on camera: Do **not** answer any of their questions after that. Just keep repeating your rights calmly if needed.  You **can** still ask a few basic questions:  * ""Am I being detained?"" * ""Am I free to go?"" * ""What is your reasonable suspicion?"" * ""Can I speak to a supervisor?""  Also, try to get:  * Officer names * Badge numbers * Their department  All of this helps if you need to file a complaint or take legal action later.  # How do you know if you’re detained?  **Ask.** Some officers won’t answer directly—don’t let them play that game. Ask clearly. If they dodge the question, say out loud: Since I'm not detained per my question not being answered, I'm walking away. Then walk away **without breaking any laws** (don’t give them a reason to detain you, like jaywalking). If you’re able to leave, consider filing a complaint with their department—and talk to a lawyer if you suspect a civil rights violation.  And always remember:  1. If police are at your door and you didn't call them - Don't answer or open the door! (They need a search warrant (for your home), exigent circumstances, or your consent for entry) 2. Cops need a \*search\* warrant to enter your home, not an arrest warrant. 3. Cops can request ID, but you don't have to give it 4. Cops need 'reasonable suspicion' to detain you    1.

">  Is there any consequence for police lying on arrest documentation? Do they not have body cams to verify the claim?  Yes, there is supposed to be, but the problem with the concept is that the people in charge of enforcing the laws, are very familiar with the exact nature of the laws and skirt them very effectively. The classic ""Foot in the door"" situation is a good example.  Between qualified immunity and their knowledge on the exact nature of the laws governing their actions, cops are very easily able to avoid effectively any reasonable regulation. Also they just turn the body cams off and claim ""It malfunctioned"". Or the tape gets corrupted/disappears.   ACAB might be the wrong way to put the sentiment, but the sentiment itself is founded in irrefutable reality.

My dad is smart, when he wants to be, but he would just turn his brain off and parrot Fox News since I was a kid (I'm mid 30's if that sets the timeline).   It took a few months of him and my mom splitting time between Fox News and MSNBC/CNN before they stopped watching Fox News. My dad realized that Fox News won't report negative things about Republicans except to try and spin the wrongdoing as some righteous person being persecuted. They never dig into the merits of an allegation against that person. The ""other side"" media reports on negatives of their own ""team"", will cover the merits of the allegation, and historical cases of that type of allegation as well.  My dad still doesn't watch Fox News and its like 5 years later now. All it took was convincing him to compare reporting on a specific incident he cared about from at least 2 different opposing ""legacy"" media sources. I framed it like he should be consuming opposing media as well so he could see how they frame the issue and compare it to his preferred media.  Side Note: My dad, who didn't even own a gun until like 12 years ago, was a single issue voter that wanted to ""protect gun rights"" for my entire life. After he switched off Fox for the last time, he told me he realized that as a disabled veteran that lives in a red state and has zero criminal history, he didn't actually have to worry about protecting his gun rights like he thought he did. He still makes fun of some democratic politicians for weird gun restriction bills like the one that was working its way through the Colorado legislature recently though.",Enabling_Turtle,2025-04-24T10:10:27,7

"Yes and no. ICE as a federal law enforcement agency is pretty bizarre. It's responsible for a bunch of different things that normally would be handled by different agencies. Historically, (as much as that can be said for an agency that was only stood up in 2003) the HSI (Homeland Security Investigations) directorate within ICE was considered to be pretty good. They are a collection of special agents focusing on transnational crime and did a lot of the stuff that people think the FBI does. Think terrorism, espionage, human trafficking, narco terrorism and counter cartel, things requiring complex and competent investigations that are actually critical to national security.  The other major directorate within ICE is the ERO (Enforcement and Removal Operations) and they have always rightfully been controversial. They aren't special agents, personnel are considered federal police. They don't investigate, they enforce. When people get mad at ICE, usually it's for something terrible that the ERO did. One of their primary duties is to show up to jails whenever someone is arrested and it's found that they have active warrants overseas or are in the United States without proper documentation. They ride in in full battle rattle, take a bunch of tasteless photos of them posing with whoever they pick up, and then escort them to a detention center, point of entry, or a plane ect till they can be sent back to their home countries. And of course they would be used for various immigration raids. So they were never really great and always involved a degree of moral flexibility but under a competently run administration that isn't actively hateful they had their place. The first Trump administration drastically expanded their role and started using them (and the CBP, which has many of the same issues as ERO and at one point was officially described as the most corrupt federal law enforcement agency in the United States) as anonymous federal shock troops.  Currently, federal law enforcement government-wide has been absolutely gutted. The Trump administration has cleaned house and has gotten rid of anyone they think could be a hindrance to their fascist policies. Offices dedicated to all those essential national security investigations are gone. And the few GS-1811 series criminal investigators (special agents) remaining are being used for this haphazard roundups of anyone that Trump administration doesn't like. Which is why you're seeing HSI, DEA, and FBI guys on these ERO raids. They're the only people left after everyone else got fired for doing their jobs. The Trump administration has made enforcement and removal the primary focus of federal law enforcement at the expense of everything else and doesn't care how cruel, how improper, how unprofessional or more importantly how illegal their actions are. They celebrate the cruelty.",Overly_Long_Reviews,2025-04-24T11:44:06,8

"Its been going on for many decades, just adapted to the modern era  Murdered KGB Propagandist defector Yuri Bezmenov in 1984 -  ""Ideological subversion is the process which is legitimate overt and open, you can see it with your own eyes. All you can do, all American media needs to do is to unplug their bananas from their ears, open up their eyes and they can see. There is no mystery. It has nothing to do with espionage. I know that espionage and intelligence gathering looks more romantic, it sells more to the audience through the advertising, probably. That's why your Hollywood producers are so crazy about James Bond type of thrillers. But in reality, the main emphasis of the KGB is not in the area of intelligence at all.   According to my opinion and the opinion of many defectors of my caliber, only about fifteen percent of time, money and manpower is spent on espionage as such. The other eighty-five percent is a slow process which we call either ideological subversion or active measures, or psychological warfare. What it basically means is, to change the perception of reality, of every American, to such an extent that despite an abundance of information no one is able to come to sensible conclusions in the interest of defending themselves, their family, their community and their country.  It's a great brainwashing process which goes very slow and is divided into four basic stages. The first one being demoralization. It takes from fifteen to twenty years to demoralize a nation. Why that many years? Because this is the minimum number of years required to educate on generation of students in the country of your enemy, exposed to the ideology of the enemy. In other words, Marxism, Leninism ideology is being pumped into the soft heads of at least three generations of American students, without being challenged or contra-balanced by the basic values of Americanism, American patriotism.  Most of the activity of the department was to compile huge amount, volume of information on individuals who were instrumental in creating public opinion. Publishers, editors, journalists, actors, educationalists, professors of political science, members of Parliament, representatives of business circles. Most of these people were divided roughly in two groups. Those who were told the Soviet foreign policy, they would be promoted to the positions of power through media and public opinion manipulation. Those who refuse the Soviet influence in their country would be character assassinated, or executed physically contra-revolution. Same was as in a small town named HEWA in South Vietnam. Several thousand so of Vietnamese were executed in one night when the city was captured by Vietcong for only two days. And American CIA could never figure out, how could possibly Communists know each individual, where he lives, where to get him, and would be arrested in one night, basically in some four hours before dawn, put on a van, taken out of the city limits and shot.  They serve purpose only at the stage of destabilization  of a nation. For example, your leftists in the United States, all these professors and all these beautiful civil rights defender, they are instrumental in the process of the subversion, only to destabilize a nation. When their job is completed, they are not needed anymore. They know too much. Some of them, when they get disillusioned, when they see that Marxist Leninist has come to power obviously they get offended. They think that they will come to power. That will never happen of course. They will be lined up against the wall and shot.""  https://youtu.be/yErKTVdETpw?si=9avnIWRQBcMXn6dQ",PLeuralNasticity,2025-04-24T10:15:31,1

"Yup.  During the last presidential election and over here during our latest federal election (Germany) I've noticed a really interesting trend. It's not unusual that accounts have cross-subreddit engagement (i.e. I have many gaming interests, work for a British company remotely and travel a lot so having some feelers across a few countries I do business in is good). But that's usually a constant. I'll have a few more posts in politics, then some on the German subreddit, then some in gaming. Also usually intermediate (i.e. make a lot of posts for a week, then take a few days off etc.) Pretty random stuff. Also, some long posts, some short quips, maybe some conflicting views occasionally. So an overall very *humanized* pattern, I'd argue.  But during the elections, I noticed a *ton* of accounts <1 year old that *suddenly* became very active in political subreddits after 4-6 month breaks that were *all* unequivocally supporting the GOP/Trump/anti-immigration/right-wing content. They used to post for 3-4 months on fairly niche gaming subreddits (usually very old online games/classic versions of online games and other smaller subreddits) and wrote the most *basic* one sentence takes they could. Basically the ""water makes things wet""-level one-sentence takes of whatever game it was. Then they were quiet for months, and *suddenly* came back to post strangely right, conservative articles and argue in comment sections.  I found dozens of these accounts.
