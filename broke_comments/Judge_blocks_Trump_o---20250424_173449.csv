"From reading some of these posts, it sounds like the judge reversed based on separation of powers, which is the right thing to do.    This judge may agree with the EO but can’t condone how it usurps authority delegated to Congress.",Snarti,2025-04-24T21:42:19,31
What prevents another judge from issuing the opposite ruling?,pcm2a,2025-04-24T18:15:23,74

"How does this not make total sense to everyone? Why on earth would or should a non citizen be allowed to vote on anything in this country? What other country anywhere in the world allows non citizens to vote in their elections? Hell, what entity anywhere allows random people not involved or invested in said entity to vote on their matters? Show me a Union that allows random folks to walk in off the street and vote for union officers or on matters that affect that union.",Tasty_Explanation_20,2025-04-24T18:21:59,35
I feared this was gonna happen. Corrupt judges using the constitution to try and stall the democratically elected president into doing exactly what the people voted for him to do. Corruption is rooted very deep in this country,ThatGuy7698,2025-04-24T18:04:49,24
These activist judges are really pissing me off. They are ruling against everything we fucking voted Trump in to do.,Wolf687,2025-04-24T19:03:50,8

"I always laugh when liberals say ""it's already illegal for illegal aliens to vote!"". Yeah lol. It's also illegal for them to jump the border but they do it anyway. The problem we have is, we have too many loopholes in the voting system. The fact that we have AI, it's 2025, but illegal aliens are still physically able to walk in and vote if they want to. And the fact that that's even physically possible is my issue. In 2025 the voting system should be so locked up That it's literally impossible for anyone to vote that shouldn't vote. And liberals do not want that.",BossJackson222,2025-04-24T22:33:58,3

"If it’s a judge at the same level, it doesn’t do anything. You just appeal to a higher court. If the higher court upholds the ruling, shit out of luck.",RontoWraps,2025-04-24T19:52:43,26

"The judge was not ruling on the merit of the law. She ruled, correctly, that the states and Congress are responsible for federal elections. Not the president.   What you should be mad at is Congress not doing their jobs. Trump fired off an EO that was unconstitutional. Demand Congress start passing laws. End of story.   This isn’t some case of a rogue judge. She’s right on this one.",EliteJassassin101,2025-04-24T21:55:59,31
"Well the judge blocked *portions* of the EO on basis that Congress regulates federal elections and not the executive branch. Constitutionally, this is correct. IMO. If we want this to happen, Congress needs to get off their asses and do the work. And then Trump will sign it into law. There should not be shortcuts in our constitutional process. That will inevitably lead to tyranny by one side, or the other. Our nation was set up by the idea that the people would govern the land by electing Congress. They should stop being lazy, or more accurately letting Trump take all of the work, and heat, of government while damn well knowing that they’re causing gridlock and profiting off of insider knowledge like the bunch of swamp monsters they are.",RontoWraps,2025-04-24T20:01:57,61
