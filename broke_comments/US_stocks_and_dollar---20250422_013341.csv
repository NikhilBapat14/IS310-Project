"If Trump really wanted lower interest rates, all he had to do was absolutely nothing for his first 100 days instead of only inflationary policies during the period.",Weak-Regular7772,2025-04-22T01:35:39,121
The Trump touch. He’s still got it.,Beforemath,2025-04-22T01:36:23,25
Never a good idea to attack your money guy. He is one of the most important people to listen to. Politicians talk rhetoric while the money guy keeps voters at least reasonably happy.,OldSchoolBubba,2025-04-22T01:39:13,15

Lord knows it couldn't be due to anything Trump has done. Who's to blame when he fires Powell and the financial sector continues to decline in historical numbers?,invalidpassword,2025-04-22T02:53:18,9
I’m guessing some of Trump’s buddies needed to grab another chunk of shares for cheap. All be sorted tomorrow.,AcceptableSwim8334,2025-04-22T03:07:52,5

No it’s not dons fault. It’s was that nasty crooked sleepy old Joe Biden. It was all his fault . Definitely not trusty trump .,i-read-it-again,2025-04-22T06:38:06,2

You're assuming that the man who doesn't understand tariffs understands the concept of interest rates,Mein_Bergkamp,2025-04-22T01:36:28,59

"Well yeah you got people trying to buy the dip, causing it to go up again. Wouldn’t surprise me if we saw it drop again when the American markets open.",Demonking3343,2025-04-22T03:54:17,6
I'm really not.  I don't think he gets any of this on any level.   He's just trying to run a playbook that doesn't work because every other country in the world can read it too AND requires the Fed to ignore a staggering amount of inflationary policy to lower interest rates for a recession that both hasn't happened yet and is entirely self-inflicted.,Weak-Regular7772,2025-04-22T01:48:07,17
"He doesn't understand anything. His every move is based on things other Presidents accomplished, and he just thinks ""Oh I'll do that"" I noticed there was no talk of taking over Canada or Greenland until there was some blurb on the news about the anniversary of Hawaii or maybe Alaska becoming a state, then suddenly, we need to bring in another state. Tariffs, he heard about them initially raising money and didn't bother to learn any further. What this imbecile doesn't recognize is that intelligence played a role. All those proceeding him had a plan, some of those worked out, some didn't. For every other President, from Kennedy to Taft to even Nixon knew the office was more important than a period of ""look at me, how great I am"" opportunity.",citymousecountyhouse,2025-04-22T02:07:22,9
"One thing I know trump understands is proving his toughness by doubling down. I hope he fires Powell, the markets tank further, and he “stabilizes” them by replacing Powell with Peter Navarro.   That would be highly entertaining and exactly what MAGA deserves.",mole_that_got_whackd,2025-04-22T03:02:17,4
"The interest rate is the percentage of people who are interested in him, right? So higher is better! /s",Arseparagus,2025-04-22T02:59:38,3

I am absolutely not a knowledgeable person in any way on this subject. But is this what is called a Dead Cat Bounce?,MyNinjaH8sU,2025-04-22T05:48:41,3
"He's cosplaying, he's not governing. He is a narcissistic sociopath concerned with looking like he's in charge and doing something. Remember that video of him in a big truck cab? It was like a little boy playing construction guy. That's all this is - playing at governance, driven by hate and greed.",ScoutsterReturns,2025-04-22T02:06:01,22
"The man hasn't had to learn to do anything other than accept bribes, handouts and daddy's money.  As far as he's concerned anything that goes wrong now will be all right when he just gets Deutsche Bank/Russia/Saudi/The EU/Mexico/Ukraine/China to give him the money he needs to sort it out.",Mein_Bergkamp,2025-04-22T02:02:21,7
"You forget that he has adivsors and vested interests.  Elon for instance seems to be very much attempting to create what his [grandfather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_N._Haldeman) (lovely chap...) was after with the technocracy movement he was part of and which wanted a North America that looked like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technocracy_movement#/media/File:BRM4117-Technate-of-America-1940_lowres2-3000x2088.jpg).  I'm also utterly certain that he was letting his inner circle of backers know when he was going to mess about with tariffs so they could make a killing on the stock market and that he honestly believes that tariffs are basically protection money that he can demand as the biggest bully on the block.  >For every other President, from Kennedy to Taft to even Nixon knew the office was more important than a period of ""look at me, how great I am"" opportunity.  His entire life has been about him and what he wants and instead of being left a laughing stock Hollywood actually decided to make his delusions a reality TV series and create an entire mythology around him that he has zero reason to disbelieve. He thinks everyhting he does works out for him because everything he's ever done has done and he's too stupid to notice when he's being used.",Mein_Bergkamp,2025-04-22T02:14:58,6
Wait til he finds about how George Washington was granted the rank “general of the armies of the United States” by congress and decides he wants the same or higher ,Western-Low4883,2025-04-22T02:35:56,2
"A lot of people (also, not sure if I would call them people?) have been prepping this country for a Trump scenario.   See: Sarah Palin. Trump is just Sarah Palin 2.0  We’ve been scheduled for destruction for quite some time.",NegotiationExtra8240,2025-04-22T22:04:52,1
"April 9th would’ve been more like a dead cat bounce, you’ll see the downtrend and a sharp, sudden “bounce” (hence the name), followed by a continued downtrend. What’s happening with the constant losses and gains is just volatility due to uncertainty in the market because Trump loves to constantly throw whatever random, awful idea he has at the economy",Ok_Character_5532,2025-04-22T06:15:19,4

"The man is the living embodiement of absolutely everything that is wrong with the privileged billionaire/multi millionaire club and the absolute worship they enjoy from a vast section of the US populace and media.  He should be triggering some sort of revolution against him, some massive overhaul of the system but sadly the Democrats seem to be run on the same principles, just more competently.",Mein_Bergkamp,2025-04-22T03:41:54,1
