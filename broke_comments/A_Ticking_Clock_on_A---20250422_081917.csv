"*Look around, take stock of where you are, and know this: Today, right now—and I mean right this second—you have the most power you’ll ever have in the current fight against authoritarianism in America. If this sounds dramatic to you, it should. Over the past five months, in many hours of many conversations with multiple people who have lived under dictators and autocrats, one message came through loud and clear: America, you are running out of time.*  *People sometimes call the descent into authoritarianism a “slide,” but that makes it sound gradual and gentle. Maria Ressa, the journalist who earned the Nobel Peace Prize for her attempts to save freedom of expression in the Philippines, told me that what she experienced during the presidency of Rodrigo Duterte is now, with startling speed and remarkable similarity, playing out in the United States under Donald Trump. Her country’s democratic struggles are highly instructive. And her message to me was this: Authoritarian leaders topple democracy faster than you can imagine. If you wait to speak out against them, you have already lost.*",Competitive_Ad291,2025-04-22T08:28:52,11

"It’s not at all clear how to have an impact as an American. I love my country and it’s been devastating to watch the laws and principles by which we live eroded by people without respect, without morals, without integrity. To me, it’s not an issue of “libs” or “maga” or opinion polls or political theater or stock prices…it’s about belief in our remarkable constitution and the laws we live by. How do we protect that? How can an ordinary person who is not a politician, a journalist, someone of any power and authority act in defense of the systems we rely on? This article is absolutely correct, but it is naive. Or, maybe too idealistic. We had a chance to act in the last election and we, as a people, failed to understand the danger. Now we pay the price. All that is left is hope that we will have another fair-enough election. If that is not available, there will be violence on all sides and it is scary as hell. It isn’t too late, maybe, but for most of us there is not much “acting” available. I will protect the people I love, I will speak when I can, I will hope that people with power will act bravely and I will do my level best to keep my eyes open, my heart clear for the moment any opportunity to restore our nation to sanity arises. It’s not being silent, it’s accepting that sometimes there is no way out but through.",Artistic_Structure34,2025-04-22T09:54:45,4

"Support your elected officials who are speaking up and stand up to those who are supporting MAGA.  Their offices record and log all calls and emails.  Get out and PROTEST.  Academic studies show that it only takes 3.5% of the population to force change.  That’s about 11 million out protesting.  The last two major protest days saw 4-5 million each.  Doubling those numbers shouldn’t be hard.   Protest MAGA businesses, lend financial support to legal and advocacy organizations defending citizens rights.  ACLU, Brennan Center and so many others.  Subscribe to mainstream journalism to support the work they’re doing.  Subscribe to the Atlantic!   Heather Cox Richardson interviewed Sen Angus King (Maine) and they discussed this specific issue.  https://www.youtube.com/live/5YHvpx3vzCE?si=clNRc_xXxQ8D_0TM",Competitive_Ad291,2025-04-22T10:05:58,4
