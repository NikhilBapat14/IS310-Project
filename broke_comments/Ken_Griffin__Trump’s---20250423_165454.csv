It's going to take multiple lifetimes because multiple things need to happen. First we have to deprogram a large swath of the population that has been sucked into the conservative cult. Once that happens then we have to completely fix our education system that has been getting destroyed since the 80's. Then once that happens we will have to spend the next 30-40 years proving to people that we're once again stable with a population that is capable of critical thinking and won't let anything like this happen again.

Frankly that doesn't seem like it is going to happen so the general decay or collapse of the country would continue as the confidence in the financial system likely is lost and doubtful a dem win in 28 pushes the party to make the sacrifices to fix the national debt (as tax increases and spending cuts are not popular) ergo restoring confidence in the financial system and US part in the global economy becomes unlikely. The damage to US as part of global defense and shifting away from US defense is also probably decades of damage (so a dem win in 28 doesn't likely fix foreign policy confidence as well we elected trump we can elect someone like him again so why tie your country to the US). At this point, the US reputation and influence is likely at best damaged for decades.

"That's definitely a factor.  There are many factors.  That's why I hate the tribalism and blaming a group like boomers, or immigrants, or whoever.  It's not helpful and everyone is responsible. ",Thirdnipple79,2025-04-23T23:58:14,1
That's a more productive way to look at things rather than just blaming boomers.    From what I see there are definitely those who are struggling and threw their hat in with trump.  Then there are those that grew up like trump - not needing much.  And want 5o continue to be on top. ,Thirdnipple79,2025-04-23T23:05:11,1
"- spending cuts (other than maybe defense) are unnecessary.  - One or more pragmatic forms of wealth taxation (not income; call it ""capital taxation"" if you prefer) are called for, though as Piketty admitted they're not so easy to devise (about as easy as totting up wealth in the 1st place).  We Americans put men on the moon before there were iPhones. If anyone can do these things, we can.  We certainly don't need any more of this whiny doomerism. We already have an Ezra Klein",realancepts4real,2025-04-23T17:55:38,1
"Do you understand how soft power works?  Do you understand that Trump has disassembled the mechanisms for applying it?  When the US steps out of the arena for 4 years, other people will step in other countries will step in. You lose the connections and the power and those take time to rebuild. And they may not be able to be rebuilt if China comes in and starts filling in the gaps we have left.  The experienced people lost. The faith in the American promise to foreign nations is crumbling.  Right now DOGE is trying to shut down the Millennium challenge corporation, which is a government agency that does international development. The agreements they have with foreign nations to provide funds and guidance are treaties.   Trump and DOGE are breaking treaties with foreign nations. These are things that take years of planning to even start  implementation, and then years to implement.  If you shut down the agency, everyone in that needs to find another job, most of them aren't coming back.  Would you trust the government again if your career is gone?   To rebuild USAID, The Millennium challenge corporation, and a variety of these other agencies is not going to be a fast process.   It's going to take more than 4 years of a democratic president, and it may potentially take a generation.  And if we keep pulling the crap we keep pulling, over the next 3 years do you think It's possible that we won't be the world's reserve currency in the future?",partypants2000,2025-04-23T19:57:23,4

"Agreed, I think it’s too simplistic to blame just boomers  You have to also consider  their early acid fueled, but ultimately empty idealism that garnered no effective change (besides riding the coat tails of actual civic right activists) and how quickly  it decayed into pro-capital milquetoast nimby centrism.",-think,2025-04-23T23:18:35,1
"""Soft power"" I've heard the term but I argue that it's a dated concept in light of the USA's $30 trillion in annual GDP. Soft power to do what? Arrange visas and immunization?  China and the rest of the world economies and the US have been an economic circular firing squad for 2 decades. China is in recession at the moment with higher unemployment so they need the US market to sell their Dollar Store stuff and Target appliances to. Our purchases provide significant employment for their workers and China and the rest of the world literally has no other market as big as ours to sell to.   Once the dust settles, sure, everyone will hate US, but so what? They'll still fill container ships with their products to send us in return for our dollars. . .",jpmondx,2025-04-24T08:25:34,1

"Soft power effects other countries policies, it influences how well countries respond to US international policies, and it can prevent political and economic rivals from gaining power.   The US is economic powerhouse, but we are burning goodwill, losing influence, and very realistically opening up avenues for our economic rivals to make stronger gains than previously possible.  If we have three more years of backwards progress, without the soft power mechanism to smooth things over we very well could lose our position as the reserve currency, for both political and economic reasons.   The British in 1870 thought that they were going to stay on top forever too.",partypants2000,2025-04-24T17:56:39,1

"I get it but as a group, the boomers were helped immensely and set up to thrive by the preceding generations and then they pulled the ladder up and shot all over the ones that followed. They are by far the most selfish generation and it isn't even close.   This doesn't speak to each individual, my Dad was a boomer and he was a great man but unfortunately as a group, it tracks.",Coconuthangover,2025-04-24T00:02:21,2
