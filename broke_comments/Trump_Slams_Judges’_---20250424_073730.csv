"It is time to invoke the 25th Amendment; Trump does not have the mental capacity to be President, regardless of the bogus recent health checkup. FYI, doofus, declaring a false ""national emergency"" does not allow you to suspend the Constitution or the law.  Illegal immigrants are not criminals; simply being in the country illegally is a civil offense, not a criminal offense. They have the right to a deportation hearing in Immigration Court, which is part of the Federal Department of Justice. Such hearings are not full-fledged trials and may be short. But without a hearing, there is no way to ensure that innocent people are not deported with no recourse.  If the Immigration Court decides the immigrant should be deported, and he or she flees to avoid deportation, THAT is a criminal offense.  Many boomers watched Superman on TV as children. Every episode opened with the announcer's statement that Superman was ""fighting a never-ending battle for Truth, Justice, and the American Way.""

You would need the VP and a majority of the cabinet. At which point Trump could simply write a letter to congress saying he's OK. Then that same group would again need to petition and Congress would need a two thirds majority in both chambers to remove the President.  That is not going to happen.
