"**Summary**: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended using Signal to discuss military operations, blaming fired Pentagon officials for leaking against Trump. He dismissed reports of sharing classified Yemen strike details with family and aides as ""politically motivated."" Critics, including GOP Rep. Don Bacon, called his actions unacceptable. Investigations continue amid growing calls for his removal. Hegseth insists he’s disrupting Pentagon bureaucracy.",pharrt,2025-04-22T09:57:04,3
