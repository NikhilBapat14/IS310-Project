"The Constitution states pretty simply that the President ""shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States."" There's no indication that it's limited to offenses committed by people.  I'm guessing the Supreme Court would rule unanimously that the pardon is valid if the case made it to them, but the chances of it getting appealed up to the Supreme Court are basically zero, so we'll probably never know.",Moccus,2025-04-08T14:04:51,7
"Citizens United already established the precedent that corporations are people so I don't think it's that far of a leap, particularly given the current makeup of the court.",Ub3rpwnag3,2025-04-08T08:03:18,7
"This is already a thing! Kind of, these companies will never be outright pardoned by the president of the US. But look at how much trouble the company Meta was in before they lobbied the government against tiktok. They lobby the government and give them money to avoid being held accountable. Lobbying is used improperly all the time like this",Sad_fruitsnackss,2025-04-09T07:12:08,1
Citizens United did not establish that.,WavesAndSaves,2025-04-08T13:35:56,7
I don’t think they decided either way on whether corporations are people in terms of pardon power. I don’t think the ruling was quite THAT broad,Ana_Na_Moose,2025-04-09T15:44:36,1
