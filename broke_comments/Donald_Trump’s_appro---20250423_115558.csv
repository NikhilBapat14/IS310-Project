">‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs net approval rating is -13, down 3 percentage points from last week and a massive 19-percentage point swing from the +6 rating at the start of his second term‚Äù  It's really concerning. To see how quickly things have changed, especially because, you know, at the start of his second term he had even a small positive rating, but now, the fact that so many Americans disapprove, well, it underlines the depth of the dissatisfaction... and it makes you wonder what he's planning to do next, because honestly, plummeting so dramatically from even a slight advantage... it's just... it's a bad look.",avid-learner-bot,2025-04-23T12:05:21,576

"Every single article in the Bill of Rights is under attack. Not figuratively. Literally. It has become a menu for Trump‚Äôs authoritarian buffet, and he‚Äôs been gorging on it in full view of a hypnotized nation while the Republican Party feeds him more courses. One by one. Line by line. They‚Äôre burning it down.  Article I Free speech? Banned books. Silenced journalists. Protesters tear-gassed. Religious freedom? Hijacked by Christian nationalism. Petitioning government? Criminalized dissent. This isn‚Äôt constitutional erosion, it‚Äôs constitutional murder.  Article II Weaponized gun culture. Not for protecting the people, but for arming his cult. Mass shootings blamed on ‚Äúmental health‚Äù while banning books that teach empathy.  Article III Not quartering soldiers, sure, but ICE raids in neighborhoods, federal agents in unmarked vans, and state-sanctioned paramilitary goons? Don't tell me your home is safe.  Article IV Warrantless spying. Phone data scraped. Protesters tracked. Police with tanks knocking down doors without cause. Privacy shredded. Surveillance normalized.  Article V Due process? Ask the wrong whistleblower. Ask the wrongly accused. Ask immigrants in cages. Double jeopardy? He‚Äôs aiming to erase accountability, not enforce rights.  Article VI Speedy and fair trials? Jan 6 seditionists coddled. Non caucasian defendants railroaded. Impartial jury? Trump wants jurors that pledge allegiance to him, not the flag.  Article VII Civil trials manipulated. Courts packed. Truth twisted. Juries intimidated. The legal system isn‚Äôt broken, it‚Äôs being reprogrammed for fascism.  Article VIII Cruel punishment? Kids in cages. Water cut in prisons. Protesters shot with rubber bullets. The cruelty isn‚Äôt a glitch, it‚Äôs the platform.  Article IX Rights not listed? Trump‚Äôs America says if it‚Äôs not written down, it doesn‚Äôt exist. Women‚Äôs autonomy. LGBTQ protections. All erased by the cult court.  Article X States' rights? Only if they bow to Trump‚Äôs ideology. GOP-led states turned into laboratories of oppression. Democracy choked at the state level.  Flooding the streets matters. Flooding inboxes matters. But here‚Äôs what must come next:  1. Demand competency testing and psychological evaluations for all presidential candidates. Low level government workers get screened more thoroughly than someone handed nuclear codes. That ends now.  2. Propose a 28th Amendment: No person under criminal indictment may run for president. Simple. Clear. Non-negotiable. Jail is not a campaign stop.  3. Organize national strikes. Stop commerce. Shut down cities. Grind the machine until it listens. Collective non-compliance is the only language tyranny fears.  4. Sue every lawmaker who aided the coup attempt. Use civil litigation. Use discovery. Drag the truth out in court, inch by inch. Make it costly. Make it public.  5. Defund corruption. Boycott Trump businesses. Pressure banks and advertisers funding far-right networks. Starve the beast financially.  6. Demand RICO investigations into the GOP as an organized criminal enterprise. Conspiracy to defraud. Conspiracy to incite. Conspiracy to overthrow. If the shoe fits, shove it up their entire institution.  7. Force media accountability. Demand disclaimers on propaganda. Demand fair coverage. Demand legal repercussions for knowingly spreading disinformation. Journalism with no ethics is complicity.  8. Create public records of enablers. Publish and archive every lawmaker, judge, business, or influencer that propped him up. Truth and memory are shields against the next attempt.  9. Refuse to vote for cowards. Primary them. Shame them. Replace them. Party lines don‚Äôt matter when the party is an accomplice.  10. Never stop speaking. Never stop organizing. Never stop showing up. Because when silence takes over, fascism fills the vacuum.  This isn‚Äôt just about Trump. This is about every future grifter who watched him get away with it and took notes.  This is about forcing the system to live up to its own promises. This is about dragging the soul of America out of the grave it‚Äôs being buried in, by the very people who swore to protect it.  No more begging. No more waiting. No more compromise with extremists. The Bill of Rights wasn‚Äôt written for billionaires, cult leaders, or strongmen.

"The writing is on the wall for all to see.  While the stock market might pop in the next week or two on tariff news, the economy is tanking. For anyone that read the Beige Book report that came out on Wednesday, it was dismal. Businesses in all FED districts are processing higher prices and slower growth. We are in stagflation. If you look at the linkup job openings index is [plummeting](https://www.linkup.com/insights/linkup-10000). If you plotted the rising unemployment by state or metropolitan area  you would be able to see that there is contagion spreading. Since January rising unemployment has spread from the DC metropolitan area into the Northeast and Midwest (the industrial rustbelt). If no significant course correction in the next few weeks, we should start to see rising weekly unemployment claims at the national level.  The economy is on the precipice of a stagflation recession......Powell might indeed lower rates to attempt to slow down unemployment's rise, but consumers will be stuck with rising prices and likely stagnate growth.      On a separate, but related track, polling for the President has remained on a steady pace of continual disapproval.

"Just to illustrate how completely Trump has Co-opted democratic powers and taken Fascistic power for himself - so far this year the Congress has passed only two bills and three joint resolutions - in four months.  They have totally abdicated their power to make laws.  While, Trump, in his first 90 days wrote 130 executive orders - orders which are not supposed to have the power of laws, but anyone who disobeys, is subject to having their funding cut, their jobs eliminated, their schools closed, their broadcast licenses revoked, or maybe they will just be disappeared to a prison cell in a foreign country without a trial?  Even the tariffs - on virtually every country in the world (except Russia of course) - those are not being done to balance trade.  If Trump wanted to balance trade he would not be sabotaging most of the U.S. primary sources of export income - like Tourism and selling world class educations to foreign students.  What Trump really wants the tariffs for is to force every major private corporation to bend the knee to him or be forced out of business when their competitors get tariff exemptions and they do not.

"I think you're asking the wrong question here by imagining the alternative timelime where there was a Democratic president in 2019-2020. Trump was president, and the question should be, what could he have done better to prevent deaths, as leader of the Republican party and MAGA movement? Given the power he has over the red states, the answer is a hell of a lot. In other words, if Trump wasn't such an incompetent, arrogant fool and was able to put in place the best advisors and follow them, how would things have been different? As many have stated, something as simple as promoting and distributing MAGA! emblazoned masks, and promoting mask wearing as a patriotic duty would have gone a long way. There are countless examples of poor management options taken by him and his sycophantic followers.  And no one is seriously suggesting all million plus deaths are attributable to his poor management, but a serious case can be (and has been) made that several hundreds of thousands of lives could probably have been saved if he had acted very differently.",mahnamahna27,2025-04-23T17:48:34,4

"All SCOTUS really needs to do to fix this situation is to make a ruling to remove Presidential immunity entirely and permanently from only Trump specifically. If SCOTUS removes Presidential immunity completely we'll go back to presumptive immunity like we had before, which will be not much better than now and doesn't fix the core issue: The fact that Trump can do whatever he wants without consequences.       However, if SCOTUS removes Presidential immunity from Trump and only Trump, he'll either get arrested immediately for what he's done already or have to toe the line to avoid getting arrested, (and we all know Trump would do something to get arrested for in a week tops) depending on whether SCOTUS decides it's retroactive or not. Just as importantly, it'll establish precedent that yeah, presidents generally speaking have immunity, but if they defy SCOTUS they risk losing that all immunity presumptive or otherwise. If SCOTUS decides to do this frivolously, then as long as the sitting president doesn't commit crimes which they shouldn't be doing anyway they're in the clear, so it doesn't give SCOTUS insane power either.       All this ruling would really do is ensure presidents have to follow the Constitution and the law or risk getting arrested. It would also provide another way to get presidents like Trump out of office in this exact kind of situation where he's breaking laws and the Constitution and defying SCOTUS constantly, so fast they can't keep up and go through all the crap that he's doing. It would give us a way of getting rid of presidents like Trump without needing impeachment from a stacked Congress.",immortalfrieza2,2025-04-23T19:39:47,13

But to these jackholes on the Right the only bad part of 2008 was them missing out/not giving the billionares enough to make them more ""generous"" and they think COVID was simultaneously a hoax, a lab made crime against humanity but also not nearly as bad as the economic impact of not pretending it didn't exist. Smh.
