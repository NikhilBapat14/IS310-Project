"The upside would be a tyrannical president not knowing who his enemies and supporters are, giving him less leverage over the legislative branch.  The downside would be the public not knowing whether their elected representative is a supporter or detractor of a tyrannical president, giving voters less information to base their voting on.",GameboyPATH,2025-04-09T15:11:42,49
"In this narrow case of impeachment it sounds like a great idea. Laws don’t work that way, so if a precedent is set, all of a sudden shadow voting becomes super popular. I’m not a fan of not knowing what my representatives are doing, we already have so little transparency for the people who are SUPPOSED  to be working for US.",Intelligent-Sound-85,2025-04-09T15:07:31,30
Absolutely not.  The public has oversight over congress.  How they vote is a matter of public record and we have the right to know.,negme,2025-04-09T15:11:21,11
No. If you can’t stand behind your principles and votes then get the fuck out of government,HeibyGB,2025-04-09T17:10:45,6
I think we've already reached the point of democratic collapse if the people's representatives need anonymity in order to vote for their constituency's best interests.,TheOvy,2025-04-09T15:11:49,3
"I sort of like the idea but the devil is in the details. I also want to know how my representatives vote on issues, so there should be some kind of process that precedes an anonymous vote to identify it as some kind of exception that is necessary... impeachment votes should definitely fit into that category, I am pretty confident Trump would be gone if that process were anonymous.",RCA2CE,2025-04-09T16:35:31,2
There should be NO instances of anonymous congressional voting. The constituency has a right to know what is being done on their behalf.,SquidsArePeople2,2025-04-09T17:58:47,2
This is a last ditch effort to preserve democracy. Definitely a radical step. If elected officials are afraid to vote the way they believe they should then the republic is on the brink of collapse.,Jorsonner,2025-04-09T16:54:00,1
"Nah, they should all be held accountable or recognized for their votes. The people deserve to know how their legislators voted. Eff their fear.",mongooser,2025-04-09T17:12:48,1
No. We should know how our representatives are voting. That’s the only way to know if they should be reelected or not.,bones_bones1,2025-04-10T06:03:43,1
"The assumption is that more people would vote in favor of something like impeachment if the vote was anonymous, but there could also be people who would vote against it if they couldn't be held accountable. It's hard to say which way it will go.  Also, the idea of elected officials having secret voting seems like it cuts against the idea of a representative democracy. If a congressman wants to keep a vote a secret because they might lose a primary then I mean... too bad, that's how it goes. People vote you into office and if you piss them off with your vote then they won't. The solution is not to just hide the vote.  It's kind of a big brain move though. ""My constituents can't be upset with me if they don't know how I voted""",UnfoldedHeart,2025-04-10T06:08:32,1
No! Every congressional vote should be public and in person.  I cant know who to vote for if I dont see their voting record.  If I elected someone so weak or corrupt that they are afraid of repurcussion for voting on their own then they cant be there.   The greater worry is how many vote based on the fear of their funding being cut and fear of being primarried by their political party.  By the party leaders.  Dems 100% vote whatever Pelosi tells them to right or wrong.   95% of Republicans do the same based on McConnel or now Thume.,Lanracie,2025-04-10T06:29:48,1
"In a democracy there should not be ANY instances of anonymous congressional voting.  Our system of government depends on representatives who are accountable to us, so we need to know how they voted.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-11T17:29:27,1
"The congressional secret vote was present until the 70s when reforms removed it. The real effect of eliminating the secret ballot was just to give party bosses total control over their membership, which is how we got Newt.   It's exactly the same dynamic as having your boss watch you punch your ballot in and make sure you're a team player. And it's not just bosses either. Every single corporate donor also has that power over Congress now, every billionaire.   In Texas we just watched last year how the governor, in conjunction with massive donors, systematically eliminated elected officials in the primary for opposing his school voucher program. This is possible because he knew how they voted.",gentlemantroglodyte,2025-04-09T16:45:48,1
I think an anonymous vote in certain rare and unusual circumstances is worth considering. Especially where the probability of retaliation is high. The handling of the votes would have to be straightforward and above board. But for almost everything a voice vote yea or nay is desirable.,Epona44,2025-04-09T18:40:08,0
Terrible Trump will simply threaten to squash any Republican to votes for secret ballot congressional voting. Dumb Donald learned his thuggery From Roy cohen and the NYC mob.,SparksFly55,2025-04-09T18:54:07,0
"I would say there should be an initial secret vote which initiates the whole thing. That way you know if there is support at all for it or its dead in the water. Then in the public vote, if the numbers change you can start to task the tough questions on why",Marchtmdsmiling,2025-04-09T22:41:12,0
"What if their voting records would be released prior to elections? That would be good for the constitutes to vote on, however, I would still worry that Musk/Trump would try to primary them based on that information.",fleshofgods0,2025-04-09T15:18:52,10
The bigger downside is the amount of bribery and corruption it opens up.,Mustafak2108,2025-04-10T05:57:55,2
"It should be done for laws for the exact same reason.   And for the same reason we keep the electorates votes secret — our biggest problem right now is that congress is for sale and there zero way for lobbyists to even know whether they’ve got a return on their investment is because votes are public.   Making votes public makes it possible to pay people to vote, which is why we don’t make the electorates votes public. This matters even more in congress.",fox-mcleod,2025-04-09T18:09:08,4
"The problem is, that those who stand up for their principles are immediately drummed out of Congress by lobbyists, party bosses, and everyone else who has money to influence a primary. So you have people left that are willing to play ball in order to stay in Congress.",gentlemantroglodyte,2025-04-09T17:25:05,-1
"The problem with anonymous voting, especially in today's political landscape, is how do we know the vote totals we are being told are accurate if we can't connect them to the voters?  If an anonymous impeachment vote happened today, and we were told the vote was 55-45 against impeachment, how could we trust the result?",Roadside_Prophet,2025-04-09T16:54:28,3
It's not particularly radical. Prior to the 1970s and the Legislative Reorganization Act it was how Congress worked normally.,gentlemantroglodyte,2025-04-09T17:23:23,0
"Fundraising happens year-round  and not only on election years.  I would want to know if the person I'm financially supporting is voting for the things I care about before donating any money.  Maybe we could avoid that issue by revamping our rules on campaign donations, but that's an even bigger can of worms.",Roadside_Prophet,2025-04-09T15:41:00,10
"That's not a bad idea for presidential election years. If the information came out, say, a month or two out from a presidential election, that'd give Trump/Musk hardly any time to meaningfully form an effective counterplay. But that timespan still makes assumptions about how long it'd take for the information to disseminate to voters.  But elections for congressional seats take place every 2 years, so revealing impeachment vote information to voters then would negate the independence benefits of keeping the president in the dark. Or... would only the congressional votes of those who are up for re-election be revealed?",GameboyPATH,2025-04-09T15:31:48,2
"This screams apocalyptic horror movie. Although things seem bad, it’s not the end times, drastic things like that are stuff you only see in third world unstable nations. This would only create new problems if you just go down the rabbit hole. If voting is secret, then I as a congressman can tell lobbyists I’ll vote for them 100% as long as they pay me and no one will know.",Intelligent-Sound-85,2025-04-09T18:17:29,3
"There's got to be some way or another to shield Representatives and Senators from such malign retribution from the interested parties you list, not to mention the mob tactics of a presidential administration.  The way should be cleared for them to vote their conscience, no matter how flimsy or stalwart, and they should answer first to their voters and a very distant second to third party interests.",ColossusOfChoads,2025-04-10T04:38:47,2
"we have multi factor authentication, there are surely ways to audit a simple vote of 100 people. Do pupils or some shit... I mean its 2025, we can count to 100 securely.",RCA2CE,2025-04-09T17:14:44,0
"I think we should also make it against the rules for a president to, explicitly or implicitly, threaten to primary members of his party.  Trump has more leverage than any president should ever have; he has effectively 'hacked' Congress.  Look at how easily he got the Senators to knuckle under when it came time to push stinker appointees through (RFK jr., etc.).  The threat of being primaried should come from within their districts or states, not from within the White House.  Hell, we probably shouldn't even *have* primaries to begin with.",ColossusOfChoads,2025-04-10T04:33:09,3
"  > This would only create new problems if you just go down the rabbit hole. If voting is secret, then I as a congressman can tell lobbyists I’ll vote for them 100% as long as they pay me and no one will know.  Yeah. Isn’t that a good thing?  They won’t know either. The electorate could tell people like Musk that too. But it’s the world’s worst investment because there’s no way to validate it.",fox-mcleod,2025-04-09T18:46:09,1
"On the other hand, the current situation is that the media agitates for primary campaigns against ""impure"" legislators. This is driving the intransigence of Congress. Secret votes at least allow crossovers and secret negotiations.",The_Webweaver,2025-04-09T18:48:53,1
"Ending primaries should be coupled to RCV. One election and you get to express your absolute priority in a clear way, without needing to think about is this person more electable than the opposition. And with more competition the political dialogue would be less toxic, as you would necessarily need to attack less and sell yourself more.",masterofshadows,2025-04-11T09:03:00,1
I was going the route where total anonymity gives free rein to do anything. We’ll get even more grifters who will only tow the bottom line to their investors instead of voters,Intelligent-Sound-85,2025-04-09T22:16:58,2

The current reality is that congress people spend nearly half their time begging for money from interest groups. They represent the people that fund them. Voters are just the people to be pacified and bamboozeled every election cycle. I think this could begin to change if average voters followed their politicians like they do their favorite celebrity or sports team.,SparksFly55,2025-04-10T08:02:23,1

> Why do you think no one pays the electorate to vote for a given person?  I’m asking you to explain why lobbies don’t cut out the middleman and pay voters.   It’s not that it’s illegal  because that’s non-unique. It’s also illegal to bribe politicians.,fox-mcleod,2025-04-10T19:12:36,1
