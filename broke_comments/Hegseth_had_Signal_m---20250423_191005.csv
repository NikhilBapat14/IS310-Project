"This is an explicit use of a messaging app to communicate classified material to outside persons. There's no way this can be construed as some 'convenient' way to setup a comms channel outside of a SCIF to persons of a 'secure' channel of communication, one might stupidly try to argue in the first round of Signalgate.   This is intentionally communicating classified info from inside a SCIF to outside persons. Like, that's it. There's no argument to be made here in opposition to this. He intentionally communicated classified information on an unclass network to outside persons. This is literally insider threat shit.",barlow_straker,2025-04-24T06:15:11,17

"The story is that Hegseth had Signal installed on his desktop. If the information he was sending out on Signal came from a classified system, he would've been in a SCIF with the desktop that had Signal installed on it. He would've been going from one system to the next or somehow had the info downgraded down to unclass to send that information.   The Post is reporting that he had it installed on an office computer, which I can't access. But here's a stupid Yahoo! News link summarizing the Post's story.

"Signal doesn't work without an internet connection; there's no way to use it on a higher classification machine and have it send the data to a lower classification machine that then can reach the internet. It was installed on his lower classification machine that can reach the internet.     With that lower classification computer running, his office is now at a lower security level. To set up the SCIF, that computer must be shutdown and ideally removed.    Not all secure spaces are SCIFs, they are only for discussion of TS/SCI, which is compartmentalized to the degree that any internet access is verboten.",mywifeletsmereddit,2025-04-24T23:09:20,1
"Back when I was in the military they blocked installing anything, but we found that Chrome had an option to install to a single user profile without any sort of admin privilege. This was back on Windows 7 at least. It allowed people to get around the domain managed internet options that blocked a lot of things.   They also blocked certain logins, like reddit. You could get to reddit itself, but couldn't log in. We found that you could go log in to reddit on chrome on another device, and email your cookies file to yourself, and then reddit would be logged in.   But all that was kinda moot anyway because higher ups would just do whatever they wanted anyway. We had a Gunny that would bring his cell phone into the SCIF to text his wife all day. Got caught but nothing happened to him. They just didn't allow him back into the SCIF. Kept his job, no NJP, nothing.",BoomerSoonerFUT,2025-04-24T16:47:49,1
