What I am questioning is why are other European countries not stepping up? Many of these African nations have been impoverished because of colonialism. Make the US irrelevant- and do something instead of frikkin just reporting how bad it is what Trump did. Yeah he sucks we know- but surely the US is not the only country in the world that can help support?,Catnbat1,2025-04-19T05:34:01,3
