"It used a civilian plane they didn’t own, with a lot of innocent civilians who were not willing combatants. Not in any way legal.",TheMikeyMac13,2025-04-06T11:15:45,18
"There is no single definition of terrorism.  But an attack that is intended to coerce for the purposes of creating social or political change is generally considered to be terrorism.  https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/terrorism  So no, it was definitely not legal.  Terrorism violates the US code.  If Al-Qaeda was a government instead of a non-state actor, then it would have been act of war.  Bush 43 created a new arguably dubious category that treats a terrorist group as a sort of quasi-state actor.  Without this, those involved would have been treated as common criminals with due process rights.    Along these lines, an American who participates in ISIL can be prosecuted for treason, even though there is no ISIL state or a war.  The treason statute specifies that one has to be aiding and abetting an enemy, when an enemy is supposed to be a nation state that is at war with the United States.",I405CA,2025-04-05T14:44:07,12
"No, because there were Civilians on the plane.  If the plane had no Civilians then an argument could be made for the Pentagon at least.  But because the planes was full of Civilians the answer is definitively no.",Wermys,2025-04-05T21:51:59,11
">be a legitimate target for an international military actor such as Al-Qaeda to go after?  Al-Qaeda is not a military in any sense of the legal framework. Hence Pentagon cannot be a legitimate target in the legal framework when the actors aren't part of the legal framework to begin with.   >If it or any other US military structure is a legitimate military target under international law, is it theoretically possible that a ‘legal 9/11’ could have been carried out?  Yes if the actor used their own military equipment and was part of the legal framework in someway such as signing Geneva Convention or wearing formal uniforms. On the latter, it shouldn't be taken as a expert assessment but rather to imply a point. So if China launched a missile attack on the Pentagon, US can't really demand a unequal compensation in the framework of the law.",Medical-Search4146,2025-04-05T21:56:38,5
This is a ridiculous question. Al-Qaeda is not a sovereign so they're not bound by international law.    That being said using civilians to attack civilians is illegal.,JKlerk,2025-04-08T07:10:22,2
"No, not only did Al Qaeda use a civilian plane with civilians inside for the attack, but they're also not a state actor. They don't represent a country, they represent an ideology. Therefore, any violent actions from them would be done with the intention of advancing that ideology, and thus it would be considered terrorism regardless of method.",AVeryBadMon,2025-04-07T06:53:24,1
I mean no one should ever attack anyone. Defensive war is the only legit war,MaineHippo83,2025-04-06T11:20:54,1
Only on Reddit can you find someone asking if using a civilian airliner filled with civilians to attack a military building is legal. Get bent,RushTall7962,2025-04-07T00:10:16,0
"True. If they had used planes without anyone else on them though, would that have made them legal though? Seeing as the actual target (the pentagon) was a military target?",RoboticsNinja1676,2025-04-07T06:15:20,1
If Al Qaeda was a government instead of a group it would not have been simply an act of war it would have been a war crime. Hijacking a plane full of civilians and flying it into a building full of civilians breaks every convention and international law.,97zx6r,2025-04-06T11:44:09,10
"> Bush 43 created a new arguably dubious category that treats a terrorist group as a sort of quasi-state actor. Without this, those involved would have been treated as common criminals with due process rights.    Kinda but not really—the other option was treating them as francs-tireurs (which legally speaking is what the Taliban fighters in Afghanistan were after their government fell), and that classification of combatants has zero rights in any capacity, to the point that summary execution upon capture is still permitted under the laws of war.",DanforthWhitcomb_,2025-04-05T23:24:35,6
"I mean, when we attacked Afghanistan we were trying to enact political change too.   I think terrorism is when you prioritize civilian targets.",rzelln,2025-04-05T16:34:14,5

Wouldn't spreading democracy by bombs also be terrorism. Isn't most state violence for the purpose of coercing others to change their politics.,GoNext_ff,2025-04-06T12:26:46,0
"That would be a different thing in my view.  I have said for years that if Hamas wore uniformed and went after the IDF only, they would be more legitimate in their cause.  Legally terrorism is defined in ways convenient for those going after terrorists, so for me the discussion often gets into war crimes.  And it is a war crime to fight out of uniform, as you cause civilian deaths as the enemy can’t tell the difference between combatants and civilians, to use civilians as shields, (again as it causes civilian deaths) and to target civilians in excess without a legitimate military aim.   So I think in terms of legal warfare it would have been defensible. As the Pentagon is a military building, and there would be a military aim even as civilians would be inside.",TheMikeyMac13,2025-04-07T06:56:28,3
Non-state actors have no legal right to attack anything.,I405CA,2025-04-07T10:41:49,2
"An attack on a military facility by a state actor would be an act of war.  I would argue within that context that the Pentagon is a military installation, even though many civilians work in it.  Of course, the hijacking of or other deliberate attack on a civilian aircraft by a state actor would be a war crime.",I405CA,2025-04-06T11:48:05,5
"Terrorism is conducted by *non-state* actors.  Governments cannot commit terrorist acts by definition.  As noted, a foreign government that had attacked the Pentagon would be engaging in an act of war.    A government that deliberately attacks civilian targets is committing *war crimes*.  There is *state-sponsored* terrorism, with terrorist groups that are funded or supported by governments but that are not themselves state actors.  In other words, state actors make war while non-state actors commit terrorism.",I405CA,2025-04-05T17:10:06,9
The OP is convinced that it was legal to attack the Pentagon.  It wasn't.,I405CA,2025-04-10T14:16:23,1
"State actors make war.    Non-state actors commit terrorism.  There are rules that govern war and there can be justifications for it, as states have sovereignty.  There are no equivalents for terrorism.  Neither state actors nor non-state actors are entitled to deliberately target civilians.  When conducted by a state actor, it's a war crime.",I405CA,2025-04-06T12:31:34,5

"Eh, fair enough. The line seems fuzzy. We, for instance, terror bombed the Germans after they terror bombed the British, killing tons of civilians and accomplishing little militarily because they hoped to 'break the will' of the other side. Russia's doing the same thing today against Ukraine.  Maybe it's just a shifting sense of what constitutes valid warfare, in an age where it's easier to aim stuff.",rzelln,2025-04-05T17:19:57,1
It’s a good thing who is and isn’t a state actor is an objective set of criteria that isn’t subject to the whims and interests of world superpowers.  Particularly when it comes to what is and isn’t a state.,TheTrueMilo,2025-04-06T07:20:18,0

"This is correct.  Civilians were considered to be fair game until after WWII.  The technology available during WWII lacked the precision to use strategic bombing to any meaningful extent without deliberately attacking cities.   Bombs often fell miles from their targets, so saturation bombing across wide areas was what they had to work with.",I405CA,2025-04-06T19:29:57,1
