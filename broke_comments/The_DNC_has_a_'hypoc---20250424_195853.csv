Oh yeah. I love that he goes on Fox News and actually takes down the bullshit talking hosts and stands up to them. Too many dems are passive and not aggressive enough.

"True. And it’s frustrating. But there’s a couple reasons why this is.   1) Republicans filibuster or block passage of bill  2) dem infighting. Unlike republicans who just blindly follow their leaders, dems speak their minds and bring up their constituents concerns. It slows down the process but that’s democracy for you.",Dapper-Substance-876,2025-04-24T20:37:48,1
