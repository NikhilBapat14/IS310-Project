"It's almost like we already did that...  *The 9/11 Commission, officially the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, was an independent, bipartisan commission established to investigate the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The commission's primary goals were to assess the circumstances surrounding the attacks, identify preparedness failures, and provide recommendations to prevent future attacks.*",Colonel-Mooseknuckle,2025-04-22T13:19:27,55

"Everything that follows is my opinion so do with it what you will but...  It's not about Racism.  It's about Control.  Saying a bunch of poor camel riders in the Middle East couldn't have done 9/11 isn't about racism, it's about the scale. What they are saying is this: ""The Powerless in the Middle East could not have done this, only the Powerful could have."" And so they seek an explanation that places the blame on the Powerful.  And they do so because the mind of the Conspirationist is deeply scarred by an intense sense of dread as well as a feeling of a complete lack of control. And they need to explain how they lack control over their own lives but instead of facing the very terrifying reality, that nobody is in control and the world is barely reined in chaos, they choose to believe in an unseen hand moving pieces about like a worldwide game of strategy. Because even if you can't control anything, *knowing is comforting*.  So it's not the USA being incompetent and complacent and it's not Middle Eastern men taking advantage of the situation. No. It's *The Global Elite*, *The Alien Lizard People*, *The Jews*, *The Deep State*, *The Cheneys*, *The Rothchilds*, it's ***THEM***. Those people who are in control. And it's important to know.  *Because if YOU know that THEY are in control, then THEY cannot control YOU anymore*.  Sure, racism might emerge from this. All sorts of shit people are going to join all sorts of movements. But conspiracies are not about racism. They are about a fundamental, existential form of dread that one might feel when faced with the reality that we're all children and the adults haven't just left us alone. They never existed to begin with.",WizardOfAeons,2025-04-22T14:54:02,1

"‚ÄúThe HSCA found that although the Commission and the different agencies and departments examining Kennedy's assassination performed in good faith and were thorough in their investigation of Oswald, they performed with ‚Äúvarying degrees of competency‚Äù and the search for possible conspiracy was inadequate.[11]:‚Ää2‚Ää The HSCA determined, based on available evidence, that the probable conspiracy did not involve the governments of Cuba or the Soviet Union. The committee also stated that the conspiracy did not involve any organized crime group, anti-Castro group, nor the FBI, CIA, or Secret Service. The committee found that it could not exclude the possibility that individual members of the national syndicate of organized crime or anti-Castro Cubans were involved in a probable conspiracy to assassinate President Kennedy.[13][10] However, some members of the committee would later state their personal belief that one of those groups was involved in the assassination, with Representative Floyd Fithian believing that the Kennedy assassination was orchestrated by members of organized crime.‚Äù  Mmmmmhm",PresidentTroyAikman,2025-04-22T14:00:50,1
