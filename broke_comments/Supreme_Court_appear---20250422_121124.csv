Keep in mind that the extent to which such content is present in elementary school anyway is just to acknowledge that some children have two mommies or two daddies.,Deinosoar,2025-04-22T12:17:54,42

"I don’t get it…  Let’s say you’re a Jehovah witness, should your schools not have any stories of birthdays or celebrations of other kids birthdays in the class?  Or you’re a Christian scientist, should your school not have any stories of medical intervention or hospitals or doctors?   Those are just factual occurrences regardless of what you believe those things still occur. Same for LGBTQ. You may not believe LGBTQ should exist but they literally do, that’s just factual in reality.

"It's not far from ""Let the parents opt out of their kids receiving information that LGBTQ people exist"" to ""Schools can never mention LGBTQ individuals at all.""   HOWEVER.  If we force these parents to accept that they have no say in what their children are exposed to, it's a VERY quick and dirty slide to ""Christians"" enforcing adherence to Christian dogma, because the precedent will have already been set.  This feels like a Red Herring. ""Don't talk about LGBTQ issues with certain kids"" feels BAD. So we're inclined to say that it's more reasonable to have a set curriculum and that's that, just like you can't opt your kid out of math class. But is someone just covering up the real plan to enforce Christian Nationalism?",Frickin_Brat,2025-04-22T13:19:44,3

"Genuine question, why is it wrong to teach kids that some girls like girls and some boys like boys, an objectively true fact?

"I don't get why it would be okay to read children a story about a kid with a mommy and daddy but not okay to read a story where the kid has two moms or two dads. It's not like either story would be sexually explicit, which I agree would be inappropriate. Why would it be damaging to elementary students to hear a story acknowledging that LGBTQ people exist?  ETA: I'll tell you why it would be a good thing for kids to be exposed to such stories: because LGBTQ people exist and not acknowledging that sends a message that they are somehow lesser because ""no one wants to hear about *them*"". Ask a POC how they felt when they were kids and nearly all the books were about white people. Ask women how they felt when nearly all of the adventure stories were about boys.",snoo_spoo,2025-04-22T12:46:15,9

"It depends on the route they take. For instance, some universities offer high school programs and even honors programs. There are a boatload of traditional and nontraditional homeschooling programs, as well. So it can be a high school graduate, or not even a high school graduate, whose child can have access to quality homeschooling.   Now, the problem is you have parents doing homeschooling and even traditional schooling, who won't take it seriously. But as homeschooling gets more and more popular, even more resources will become available. So I agree with the poster that said, if you don't like what's going on in a traditional classroom setting...consider homeschooling, if possible. It's not always possible. I understand that.",ConclusionRelative,2025-04-23T14:51:22,1

I mean, do you think a parent should be able to override any and all lessons? And that the child should still be considered to have a completed education.   Can a parent remove their child from any history lesson? What if they don't want their child to be told slavery is wrong?   What if they don't believe in any of this hogwash about the sun being the center of the solar system. Damn it, everything revolves around the earth and I will not have my child be taught otherwise.   It is against my belief as a parent that my child needs to know anything past addition and subtraction. I demand them to be removed from any math class that teaches further than that.
