"We don't need any weird-ass jargon fueled movements like them.   We just need to accept that Republicans are bad people who fundamentally do not believe, and are trying to remove, the equal protections under the law guarateed to everyone in this nation by law.   That's it. You don't need any ridiculous buzz words. You just need to accept that, and stop dealing with them in good faith, and stop listening to the shit they say, and get the fuck out there and vote them away.  Republicans have attacked or dismantled nearly every equal protections provided to us by law. They believe might makes right and they have stopped pretending otherwise. They never compromise, and never will. They'll gaslight you into believing that the things they want are the things you're trying to do, and they'll do it knowingly and as a blatant lie.   Just understand that about these people, and act accordingly. Stop falling for their propaganda, stop believing they are or ever will be the solution, and just bury this miserable useless organized crime ring masquerading as a political party beneath the grave dirt of history, forever.",StoppableHulk,2025-04-23T23:22:16,8

"What's that supposed to mean?   Democrats need to start fighting. I have no clue what 'Dark Woke' is supposed to mean.    I would argue that we should maybe start fighting back, like, some Trans girl trying to play some high school sport nobody gives a shit about isn't the CEO of Raytheon, fighting for endless wars.  She isn't the one shipping your jobs overseas.   Some gay dudes or lesbian ladies trying to get married aren't purchasing politicians.    Democrats need to get their shit together.",gorobotkillkill,2025-04-23T22:40:18,4
