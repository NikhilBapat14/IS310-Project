"Damn, we really need to do something about this.   But not those evil, dangerous vaccinations. No sirree. No government microchips for me.   But something does need to be done.   We should develop a way to safely expose people to low levels of measles. Just enough for our bodies immune systems to learn to fight it, but not enough to make it sick.   Something we could put directly into our bodies, to ensure that reaction.   Once it's developed, we could call them Trump brand immuno-boosters, and hand them out at McDs & KFC.",Cat_herder_81,2025-04-24T17:04:50,1

"Point?  We've still got 3 + years with stupid.  We've past the ""point"", now get ready for what happens afterwards. I suggest getting your children fully vaccinated. Learn about the new plagues as best as you can and keep a close eye on things.  Hopefully we'll not overwhelm our broken medical system... again.  Add-on! It's a good time for a new career choice!

You should. Conservatives will always be with us. If conservatives become convinced that they cannot win democratically, they will not abandon conservatism.
