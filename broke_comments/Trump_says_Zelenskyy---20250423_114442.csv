Or so he thinks, anyways.   Getting re-elected after everything he’s done and consequently getting away from his convictions, scot-free, was bound to embolden a man like him.  His behavior doesn’t mean he is literally a Russian asset, per se, but it’s kinda silly to think the guy cares or is concerned about things like laws or being exposed for breaking them. It didn’t stop him from being a fraudster, criminal, and liar before he was president. I think it’s more crazy to imagine he’d just stop doing that now, of all times.
