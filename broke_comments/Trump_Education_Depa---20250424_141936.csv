"Federal judges responding to two lawsuits have temporarily blocked the Trump administration from enforcing its demands that schools end practices associated with diversity, equity, and inclusion.  The injunctions come the same day that the Education Department had set as a deadline for states to certify compliance with the Trump administration’s contested interpretation of civil rights law – or risk their federal funding.  One injunction blocks the Education Department from withholding federal funds from states and school districts that employ members of the National Education Association, a teachers union that says it has 3 million members, but allows the certification demand to remain in place for communities with no NEA members.  The other injunction, which applies nationwide, temporarily blocks the Education Department from enforcing new interpretations of civil rights law that it first laid out in a February Dear Colleague letter. But the judge in that case declined to block the certification demand that relies on the same interpretation.",chalkbeat,2025-04-24T14:20:09,3
