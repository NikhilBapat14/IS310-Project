Why are we letting the narrative change? The economic theory here isn’t even too complicated. It should be well advertised the consequences of what Trump wants the Fed to do.  Changing interest rates (either up or down) at the wrong economic moment in time can and will have major consequences.  Imagine what 2020 would have looked like if the Fed had listened to Trump in 2018/2019 and lowered the interest rates? Remember Trump wanted a zero or near zero interest rate. If heading into COVID we had that then we would have been very screwed. Of course the fed couldn’t predict COVID but by following the economics and not the opinions some economic pain was avoided.,hmr0987,2025-04-22T13:23:25,1

"Considering that both Powell and Fauci were appointed to their roles by Trump himself (Powell as chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve and Fauci as the leader of the White House Coronavirus taskforce), it's just par for the course that Trump shows zero self reflection on what that would say about his hiring decisions.   To be clear, both Powell and Fauci are highly regarded and recognised leaders in their respective fields. Not that Trump would understand that.

Powell isn’t doing that now, Trump is.   For another, COVID was an outside force. Trump’s decisions are Trump’s alone. When everyone thinks of the tariffs, they think of Trump with that goofy poster board with the numbers on it. Even Trump’s allies and supporters can’t get around that.   And finally and probably most damningly, Trump is supposed to be “Daddy’s coming home, and he’s pissed”. He was the little guy in his first term, the humble businessman beset on all sides by a corrupt government. That’s why he could pull off “deep state” accusations. That’s why Qanon became a thing. Trump’s entire mission statement this second term is that he knows what he wants and he’s going to get it, which works when you’re justifying DOGE cuts and deportations, but that also means he takes de-facto blame for everything that goes wrong, whether he wants to or not.",vmsrii,2025-04-22T10:49:41,17

"Yup. But he has put Jerome Powell in an impossible situation. His tariffs will cause both inflation and a recession. To combat the recession, Powell needs to cut interest rates as Trump wants. To combat inflation, Powell needs to increase interest rates, which Trump doesn't want. Powell can only fix one of Trump's self-inflicted wounds by making the other one worse.   But since Paul Volcker, the accepted wisdom in the Federal Reserve is that inflation should be fixed first in order to avoid stagflation. And the whole reason that central banks, like the Federal Reserve, are fairly independent, is to avoid running monetary policy according to election cycles.   The Fed could indeed lower interest rates to make people in the USA feel a bit wealthier right now but this would pretty much guarantee stagflation similar (or worse) than that of the 1970s. And that level of stagflation would end up requiring much worse medicine later to fix. At most, Powell can hold rates somewhat steady and try to manage the crisis that Trump created without really solving either problem.",t_hab,2025-04-22T11:42:36,3

They called it export licensing. Sounds like something a trade lawyer might actually be excited about. But make no mistake: this was a surgical strike. They didn’t need to say no. They just needed to say “maybe later” to the right set of paperwork. These licenses give Beijing control over not just where these materials go, but how fast they go, in what quantity, and to which politically convenient customers. >  > The U.S.? Let’s just say Washington should get comfortable waiting behind the rope line. The licenses have to be applied for and the end use including country of final destination must be clearly spelled out. Licenses for end uses in the U.S. are unlikely to be approved. What’s astonishing is how predictable this all was. China has spent decades building its dominance over these supply chains, while the U.S. was busy outsourcing, divesting, and cheerfully ignoring every report that said, “Hey, maybe 90% dependence on a single country we keep starting trade wars with and rattling sabers at is a bad idea.” >  > Try ramping up your semiconductor fab or solar plant when your indium source just dried up. It’s a fun exercise in learning which of your suppliers used to be dependent on Beijing but never mentioned it in the quarterly call. >  > The materials China just restricted aren’t random. They’re chosen with the precision of someone who’s read U.S. product spec sheets and defense procurement orders. Start with dysprosium. If your electric motor needs to function at high temperatures—and they all do—then mostly it is using neodymium magnets doped with dysprosium. No dysprosium, no thermal stability. No thermal stability, no functioning motor in your F-35 or your Mustang Mach-E. China controls essentially the entire supply of dysprosium, and no, there is no magical mine in Wyoming or Quebec waiting in the wings. If dysprosium doesn’t come out of China, it doesn’t come out at all. It’s the spinal cord of electrification, and right now China’s holding the vertebrae. >  > So here we are.

"The day he put the 90 day pause. I was on an airplane and the person next to me had on Fox News, and I had something a like cbs news on. The banners were literally polar opposites.   Fox: basically said that Trump knows what he is doing, don’t panic, everything is going to plan.   CBS: I don’t think Trump has a plan, these tariffs don’t make any sense the way they are being implemented.   Same day morning shows. And later that day, he reversed positions due to pressure. which according to Trump, was not the plan. He was upset that he couldn’t do his beautiful plan due to people panicking. 🤣✌️",ButterscotchLow8950,2025-04-22T13:12:05,4

"The problem with Fauci is that he didn't demand that then-45 didn't inject bleach and shove a lightbulb up his butt -- live on TV to assure the American people that those were effective preventatives/remedies for COVID-19..  Tony, I will forever hold that oversight against you.  What would it have cost you?  Maybe like 4 bucks to run down to Wal-Mart and get a gallon of bleach and a light bulb?

Look at him on the border. Crossings were dropping and there was a bipartisan bill on place partly written by Lankford. Then Trump whined about it without reading it and Republicans including Lankford backed out because they wouldn't have anything to whine about relating to the election. Democrats should have killed them on that,rounder55,2025-04-22T13:40:08,1

"If Trump would have simply wore a mask and said it could save the loves of those you love it would have saved thousands of lives  Instead he was probably afraid his orange make-up would smear up and show up on the mask  This will be the same thing all over. We were fortunate enough to have a vaccine that was pretty efficient overall in terms of preventing death and people, despite seeing thousands of people dropping dead daily fought it, even after it was well tested. I understand not lining up to be the first person. Asking questions is fine and something id encourage. Pretending you know more about than large teams of researchers dedicating every hour of their workday to your health is idiotic.

His fate was assigned to him far before the bleach comment. Doesn’t anyone remember how much chatter was going around that Trump was going to turn on fauci because of how much good press and respect fauci was garnering and how he was stealing all the attention from Trump because people wanted to hear what he had to say?
