"The lawyer supporting wanting opt-outs of LGBTQ book reading  in classrooms said ""indoctrinate"" many times in his arguments to the SCOTUS.  So which institution does the ""indoctrinating"", the one teaching knowledge, acceptance, and tolerance in the community or the one teaching hate and exclusion under penalty of assumed eternal damnation, parental physical discipline, and abandonment?",MentalTourniquet,2025-04-23T11:44:17,53
"A court just ruled Mississippi can now prevent trans people from changing their names until they're 21. 17 year old boys and 15 year old girls can change their names due to marriage, but voting and military age adults who happen to be trans cannot. The US is also prepping its own Cass Review, which is the blatantly flawed propaganda piece the UK has now used to justify restricting gender affirming care for adults, ban trans women from ALL women's spaces and even to define which cis women legally count as lesbians under hate crime laws.   LGBTQ+ people are facing a global campaign to erase us. It doesn't end with trans women in sports, bathrooms or prisons. It ends with our complete erasure.",Penguin_Sushi,2025-04-23T12:00:11,32

"We truly thought the GOP was on its last legs, that the efforts to re-elect Trump were its last gasps before fading into irrelevance. Now look at it. Stronger than ever.

"As of 2025, a staggering 867 bills have been introduced targeting transgender people across the United States.   * Of these, 122 would ban gender-affirming care for some segment of the trans population.  * Another 77 seek to bar transgender people from certain bathrooms — a threat made more tangible as arrests for alleged “wrong bathroom” usage have begun to mount.  * Seventy-three bills aim to eliminate legal recognition of transgender people entirely, often by revoking updated driver’s licenses, stripping correct gender markers, and invalidating identification documents.  * Others target drag (and transgender people dressed in the “wrong clothes”) or require schools to forcibly out transgender students.  * A newer, especially chilling category would classify gender-affirming care or even social transition as [child abuse](https://montanafreepress.org/2025/04/08/felony-bill-for-parents-doctors-of-trans-minors-voted-down-by-bipartisan-house-coalition/), opening the door for state-sanctioned removal of trans youth from supportive homes.   >   As state legislatures escalate their assault on transgender rights, the federal government under Trump has doubled down — punishing blue states for protective laws, banning transgender people from military service, investigating teachers for affirming trans students, defunding hospitals that provide care, and targeting organizations simply for acknowledging the word “transgender.” In scope and intensity, 2025 has become the most punishing year yet for transgender people in America. The goal is unmistakable: to make it nearly impossible for transgender people to live openly, safely, and with dignity in public life.  But we can't say it's a genocide.",southpawFA,2025-04-23T11:43:14,30

Imagine if blue states pulled their taxes from funding these red states and used that extra money to help Americans leave those red states.   It's not like they're benefiting from being taxed... why would you keep paying when all you get in return is a government that doesn't help its citizens after a natural disaster and instead funnels it into the pockets of corrupt politicians and oligarchs?,Rich-Leg510,2025-04-23T11:53:20,7

It’s very telling how few upvotes this post has compared to others in this sub. Surprised there isn’t a swarm of commenters here screaming about how it’s a “CULTURE WAR” when us LGBTQ people actually have to live through this shit.,Kavani18,2025-04-24T06:19:20,5

"Here's even more:     The American Principles Project has even admitted that they are going after no-fault divorces:   [https://x.com/GBBranstetter/status/1503883921246859267](https://x.com/GBBranstetter/status/1503883921246859267)     And they also want to attack asexual marriages as well, basically forcing married people to have sex.    The Weatherspoon Institute, which is run by the American Principles Project founder Robert P. George,  attacked asexual marriages as somehow being a gateway to a ""marriage inferno"" due to no sex being involved. They basically made the case for an 11th commandment, to where everyone has to be forced into sex or else be damned to hellfire!    It's rather interested that they are even mad at asexual people like me for not wanting to have sex, when their whole worldview is steeped in ""purity culture"". It's so outlandish.

"Much of the founding of the Abrahamic religions comes from a state of being or feeling persecuted. It is baked into the ideology regardless of the messages of community and love that can be picked from the Bible and other accompanying holy books.  People lacking reasoning and deduction skills, of which religions attract many, take this persecution complex to heart and allow themselves to be blinded to the reality of both the world and their own actions while manipulative cons seek positions of power to wield these individuals like a cudgel as a simultaneous distraction and tool for accumulating more power either within the faith or politically.",TheGreatHornedRat,2025-04-23T12:06:00,9
