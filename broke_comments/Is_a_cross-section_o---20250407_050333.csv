"I think this is a great talking point.  The increase in mailing could either be that the number of solicitations needed is greater, or that every solicitation is successful so they just send more out and haven't noticed diminishing returns.  But to the greater question at hand: When will the well for donations and grifting run dry? Unfortunately I don't think it will be any time soon. It's been ten years and the Republicans have a lot to point at and say ""Look at what your money allows us to accomplish!"" *while also saying* ""We need continued support to stop the destruction of this country!"", regardless of how disingenuous it is. It seems like MAGA is willing to spend every drop of extra money they have on donation and merch. It is their entire personality after all - would you fault someone into NFL for spending their extra money on jerseys or signed footballs? Or a DnD nerd buying miniatures and adventure modules?  Others may see it as falling for a grift or being milked. But they see it as expressing who they are and fighting for what they believe in.  I'd also like to mention **every** politician solicits for donations. I recently signed up for AOC's email list expecting news and ""here's how to fight back"" but I get one or two emails a day asking for donations when it's not even election season.",derbyt,2025-04-08T07:40:29,56
"I get tons of email spam asking me to throw in cash to stop Trump, stop Elon, stop DOGE, promote 50501, support AOC, save NPR, all kinds of shit I didn't sign up for. This isn't a problem unique to the right",theyfellforthedecoy,2025-04-08T15:34:12,4

"I will point out that it took more than 20 years for the feaver to burn out in the Burned Over District, and people were generally poorer than they are now. I think eventually people will notice that they're getting stiffed by these conmen, but it could literally take a generation of believers dying penniless to line their prophet's pockets to break the back of it.",VodkaBeatsCube,2025-04-08T08:02:47,19
"The reason rubes today have more money than the ""burned over fools"" is due to   medicaide, medicare and Social Security. Most of our religious idiots today will vote themselves back into poverty if their preacher says Jesus is on his way. I am Hoping America's fever of Stupidity will break after enough baby boomers die off.",SparksFly55,2025-04-13T21:22:40,0
