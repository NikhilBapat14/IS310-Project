"I agree with Roger Stone. Let's vigorously enforce all Logan Act violations.  We can start with Van Hollen, who flew to El Salvador to negotiate the release of a person who was illegally detained and deported per the Supreme Court's ruling. Then once that's done, we can look for other violations. Like whoever it was that made an illegal deal with El Salvador to extrajudicially jail the people they kidnapped.",Iamjacksplasmid,2025-04-23T15:47:06,14

"I can't see how. He was acting as part of the legislative branch to assist one of his constituents.   > “Any citizen of the United States, wherever he may be, who, without authority of the United States, directly or indirectly commences or carries on any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof, with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent thereof, in relation to any disputes or controversies with the United States, or to defeat the measures of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.  Seems like the answer is, ""No"" based on the words here. The executive branch has declared that they don't have a stake in the imprisonment and we're not ""in dispute"" with El Salvador. The Senator should have express authority to represent his constituents. If not, here is the next paragraph..  > “This section shall not abridge the right of a citizen to apply, himself or his agent, to any foreign government or the agents thereof for redress of any injury which he may have sustained from such government or any of its agents or subjects.”  Which clearly suggests to me that as a representative of the man, he's been given an affirmative defense against anyone claiming he did violate the act.",Grandpa_No,2025-04-23T16:05:16,4
