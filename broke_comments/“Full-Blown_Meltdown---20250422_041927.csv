Don Jr “exiled” a critic from MAGA. Totally not a cult.,MattTheSmithers,2025-04-22T11:05:57,5
"Never in our history have we had such a fragile administration of total babies. These people have all the power anyone could ever want, but even the most modest, measured disagreement seems to threaten that power.  The problem for authoritarians—and one they will never overcome—is their innate weakness. They appear to be strong, but policies designed by only a few loyalists—without any input from those who disagree with them—are always more prone to failure than those designed with input from detractors.  This is the case across the board, no matter the policy or plan. They’ll always miss something, and their government will always be weak; prone to falling apart if the details of their failures are exposed to the light of day.  All authoritarians know this. It’s why they rage against even the smallest disagreement others may have with them. They know they’re weak, they know it can all fall apart at any moment, and they know they must crush all dissent before it takes hold. This is why they are often so brutal with their responses.  Hegseth doesn’t actually matter to the administration. He’s a former Fox News talking head. He’s not particularly smart. He doesn’t have any expertise they couldn’t find in abundance elsewhere. But he’s *their* guy, and if they admit they made a mistake with him, a crack forms in the facade. That crack, they worry, will spread; if they fucked up with Hegseth’s hiring, maybe they fucked up elsewhere. (They know they have, and they know there’s a good chance people will find out, so they set the tone early and make it clear that any and all dissent will be met with a nuclear response.)  At his core, Trump is an authoritarian. He does not tolerate any form of dissent, whether inside his companies or his government. He knows it diminishes his power and threatens his overall hold on it. So does his son, who is otherwise the dumbest asshole in the room, but he understands how to act like an authoritarian.",dmetzcher,2025-04-22T15:36:45,5

"The issue is that people aren't hired for competence, but the appearance of competence, and, if course, fealty to Dear Leader.    Hegset isn't a military expert, he played one in TV. It was like putting John Wayne in charge of the Marines. Yes, it looks good. But management (not leadership - that's useless) is about dull attention to details and gradual upgrades to a large organization.    So of course these meatheads fail. And since everything is about Dear Leader, they can't just fail and be replaced. It's a personal reflection on the only person with real authority. They wounded the perception of infallibility of the infallible leader.   This is why authoritarian leadership sucks. It's just perception, and they're never chosen for competence. So they always fail. And it's always a crisis.   Authoritarian rule is always incompetent, always in crisis,and always, always exhausting for everyone around them.",waffle299,2025-04-22T09:44:19,5

"I love that poem. After the election I was drawn to William Butler Yeats. His poem entitled 'The Second Coming'... I still get chills from both.  Turning and turning in the widening gyre    The falcon cannot hear the falconer; Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere    The ceremony of innocence is drowned; The best lack all conviction, while the worst    Are full of passionate intensity. Surely some revelation is at hand; Surely the Second Coming is at hand.    The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out    When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert    A shape with lion body and the head of a man,    A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,    Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it    Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.    The darkness drops again; but now I know    That twenty centuries of stony sleep Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,    And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,    Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?  *edit- apologies for the formatting (mobile)",the_saint_of_taint,2025-04-22T11:17:37,17

And the whole party would've treated running this person as the presidential candidate as an untimely April Fools joke.  Harris was the most unqualified (maybe even disqualified) candidate to run in modern history. We Dems treated her identity labels as inherent merit that elevated her despite her complete failings everywhere else. The rest of the electorate refused to grade her on our curve just because we marked her up for race & sex.  There are many strong, promising female politicians in the Dem party. Harris was never one. We need to stop pretending candidates are at a baseline level of quality just because of their identity labels, despite all their obvious deficiencies. Honestly, that's a form of bigotry too. As a queer PoC, it's really chilling watching the Dem party pretend people are great just because of their identity independent of their actual nature.

"The Second Coming  By William Butler Yeats   Turning and turning in the widening gyre    The falcon cannot hear the falconer; Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere    The ceremony of innocence is drowned; The best lack all conviction, while the worst    Are full of passionate intensity.  Surely some revelation is at hand; Surely the Second Coming is at hand.    The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out    When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert    A shape with lion body and the head of a man,    A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,    Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it    Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.     The darkness drops again; but now I know    That twenty centuries of stony sleep Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,    And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,    Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?",NoSeaworthiness5308,2025-04-22T13:58:20,2

"I mean, I saw her speak live in the 2020 primaries. Room full of black women and she bombed like a bad stand-up comic--did far worse than Buttigieg, Gillibrand, or Klobuchar and none of those three was near the top that day (Cory Booker actually came in top, but he had family connections to the room). At that moment, I said ""well, this person will never have a career on the national stage"". And then Biden announced he was going to pick a black woman and chose the worst performer in that year's cycle with no political capital from a completely noncompetitive state just based on her identity.

">So your ""only true qualification"" (love all the qualifiers you added) is something you literally made up, and something that was moot anyway this last election.   Oh come on. ""Winning the primary"" is not a made-up qualification for running for president. The instant you argue that, you're bending over backwards to deny reality. That's some Blue MAGA mentality.  And yes, we didn't have a proper primary last election. *That's not a good thing*. And the end-result is that we picked someone who was absolutely disqualified the last time we *did* run a primary, so probably one of the last choices you should go with. Yeah, we couldn't have a primary in 2024 because our own party's extremely public dysfunction blocked us from doing the right thing. But why on Earth should voters cut us slack for that?!? That's like saying ""well yes, we shouldn't have gotten wasted, stolen someone's car, and started driving down the highway going the wrong way--but once we were in that position, we drove as well as we could so nobody should hold it against us.""  >And what ""complete failings everywhere else""?  2020 primary is the biggest one. But the others, I'd say:  * Her age. At a time everyone was screaming for a younger candidate, our gerontocracy is extremely unpopular, and our party has been breaking age norms basically every election since 2000, we ran someone who'd be one of the older first-term presidents. We needed to repair that brand damage and we instead ran someone approaching retirement age. * Coastal lawyers are probably the most hated archetype in America, alongside Washington insider. Our party has an unhealthy addiction to running coastal lawyers turned Washington insider in the 21st century--check our presidential candidacy rates there and compare to Republican candidates + Dem historical candidates. Wtf are we doing, it's like we're trying to lose. Harris in 2024 was both. * Not only was she a coastal lawyer, she's a coastal lawyer from a state with absolutely zero value. This person would not be a good conventional VP pick to balance the ticket for any reason *except* identity. There's a reason Republicans balance their ticket by geography, which is way more important for many Americans' identities. * Low-charisma. She just couldn't give a good speech or command attention. She wouldn't be your worst student in your average college speech course, but she wouldn't be one of the better ones either. * Bad political instincts--or maybe just too weak to stand up for herself. The lit coming out post-Biden paints a very unflattering picture of Harris's ability to stand up to Biden and her lack of recognition of just how badly she needed to separate. That Jonathan Allen book was devastating. * Didn't have a reason to run. Really, she couldn't articulate anything really beyond ""I'm here, it's my turn, Trump bad."" Made everything she did ring hollow and insincere.  I'd say Biden was around the bottom 1% of electability. There are about 258 million adult Americans (not looking up the # that are over-35, you get the point). That means Biden is less electable than about 255 million Americans. Your average person you saw in the street was almost certainly far more electable than Biden. I'd put Harris in the bottom 10% of electability myself. Way better than Biden, but you still probably meet plenty of people who could do better.",Sminahin,2025-04-22T13:05:47,1
