"Another Trump administration official familiar with the situation said Rubio was unhappy with Marocco, but it wasn’t ideological. Marocco didn’t get along well with many of his immediate colleagues, including people who reported to him. Rubio and others also were frustrated with how Marocco handled his day-to-day duties, the official said.  “It wasn’t just Rubio who wanted him moved,” the official said. “It was a group decision, including people from the White House, who were getting complaints about him.”  A former U.S. official in touch with people who worked with Marocco at State echoed that explanation. Marocco had largely sidelined career employees who could help him do his job and was often “flying blind,” the former official said.  Marocco has a history of rankling his co-workers, including during the first Trump administration, when he held several positions. In 2020, he spent a few months at USAID, where his style and demands upset staffers so much that they crafted a 13-page memo laying out their concerns for the agency’s senior leaders.  I think Rubio did the right thing here!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-22T16:23:00,5
