CBP and ICE have the competency to determine immigration status. Use them to determine it. Valid visa? Permanent residency? All set. Nothing to prove they’re here legally? GTFO! That’s what happens at a port of entry. There’s no “due process”! Need asylum? That’s no reason to become a criminal by entering the country illegally.,rdenghel,2025-04-23T09:31:44,5
