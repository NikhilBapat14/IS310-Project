"DARVO (an acronym for ""deny, attack, reverse victim & offender"") is a reaction that perpetrators of wrongdoing, such as sexual offenders, may display in response to being held accountable for their behavior.[1] Some researchers indicate that it is a common manipulation strategy of psychological abusers.[2][3][4]  DARVO is a tactic used by a perpetrator to avoid accountability for their actions. As the acronym suggests, DARVO commonly involves these steps: The perpetrator denies the harm or abuse ever took place. When confronted with evidence, the perpetrator then attacks the person that they had harmed, or are still harming. The attacker may also attack the victim's family and/or friends. Finally, the perpetrator claims that they were or are actually the victim in the situation, thus reversing the positions of victim and offender.[2][4] It often involves not just playing the victim but also victim blaming.[3]",MariosBrother1,2025-04-23T20:30:27,2

"Trump has become a laughingstock on Chinese social media.  He is caving in, and everyone sees it.  The Chinese government are not even engaging in trade talks with their lower level officials (a prerequisite to any substantial trade agreement), and Trump is lying through his teeth that there are ""active"" negotiations.  Am gonna hate to see it but soon there will be mayhem in the US when the ginormous tariffs on China hit the supply chain and our shelves in Target, Home Depot, Walmart, and grocery stores.  The execs of Walmart, Home Depot, Target met with Trump 2 days ago, and he has since softened his rabid talk on China tariffs because they probably knocked some sense into his fat head.",lamapo,2025-04-24T06:29:09,1

"These tactics are similar to other techniques used by perpetrators to avoid accountability by manipulating observers' perceptions of events. Researchers have noted similarities to outrage management, where a perpetrator tries to make observers think better of themself and their actions so they can avoid consequences. This strategy often involves denying the victim's version of events and trying to make observers doubt the victim's credibility, which are both key aspects of DARVO. Relevant techniques also include playing the victim and playing the hero, which perpetrators use to downplay the harm seen in their behavior. In playing the victim, a perpetrator highlights their own past suffering to attempt to be seen as a victim as well, and in playing the hero, a perpetrator admits to some amount of wrongdoing but highlights their own past good deeds to mitigate their harmful ones. Both techniques may come into play for the denying or reversing stages of DARVO.[",MariosBrother1,2025-04-23T20:32:23,2
