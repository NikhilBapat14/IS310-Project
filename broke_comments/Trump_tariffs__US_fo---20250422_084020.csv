"And then there are the ripple effects that keep branching out. Two countries that might have never traded with each other hit by tariffs might look at each other and think, ""Hey I was buying this from them? Can I buy it from you?"" And then it becomes business that will never come back to the US even after tariffs end.   And then further ripples. Businesses and countries might decide to skip investing in the US entirely out of fear of a tariff popping up on random thursdays or fridays that might put them out of business.   Then even further out there are going to be kids growing up right now where the US is attacking them in a trade war, or threatening to annex them. Those kids will grow up as a new generation that is highly skeptical of the US.   This is going to hurt the US for generations. I am sure Putin could not be more proud of Trump.",wildweaver32,2025-04-22T10:24:46,12

"Companies AND countries are now acutely aware that a change in US administration could result in a seismic shift in relationships and/or agreements. Major deals are rarely able to be formulated, initiated, and concluded within a four year window, so doing business with the US has likely just dropped down the favourability rankings to the level of doing business with a dictatorship (which at least you know is likely more stable).",nucknuckgoose,2025-04-22T11:56:01,5

"It's a bad economy for the common person.  If you have billions of dollars, the impact of what we're facing is pretty meaningless  If you have 400 billion, you can now buy even more stock or property and hold it for the long run.   Law and order will continue to exist, they'll just be able to control it much more through private security or owning the politicians controlling the police.",_not2na,2025-04-22T09:52:22,2
"Law and order will not continue to exist if it's in the hands of the super rich instead of a Democratically elected government.  There is a reason why rich folk don't rush to keep their money in Russia or China.
