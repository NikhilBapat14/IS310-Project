"You're drawing connections between things that don't necessarily seem connected. A tariff is different than a tax on corporate profits, for instance. If the United States puts a massive tariff on Chinese EVs to the point that it makes no sense for them to be sold in America at all, consumers can't get cheaper, superior vehicles to the ones produced in the United States, and US car manufactures can afford to jack up their prices while doing nothing to improve their product because they don't have to worry about foreign competition. It's the worst of both worlds - consumers are poorer, and the rich get richer. That's fundamentally *different* to a tax on corporate profits within the United States. Because it's applied equally, it doesn't distort the market in the same way, and because it's on profits, not the value of an import, it doesn't establish effective price floors which might cause players to leave the market entirely; taxes on profit can only *reduce* profit, not eliminate it.",Mjolnir2000,2025-04-05T17:06:59,32
What are you talking about nobody is mad that they're too rich    no we don't want our economy to drop and Tariffs are impacting everybody in case you haven't noticed a lot of our stuff comes from other places they're not going to start making them here because it's cheaper they're just going to raise the prices meanwhile tariffs have Disrupted the movement of everything And crush small businesses,[deleted],2025-04-05T14:31:05,9
"I don’t think anything you said is necessarily conflicting.  Why do iPhones need to be expensive if corporations pay high taxes? Corporate taxes, by definition do not make operating more expensive. Corporate taxes are a tax on profits, not revenues. You might see some try to out greed the taxes, but ultimately, higher taxes on profits actually encourage reinvestment. Every dollar they spend on R&D, employee wages, or infrastructure is a dollar that might help them get more dollars instead of going to the government. That's a healthy incentive for the country.  Billionaires aren't a problem because they’re “too rich”. It’s that their wealth has become so systemically important that its movements affect everyone. It's ""too big to fail"" for personal wealth and now their financial gravity distorts markets. Now we have to face the harsh reality that is correcting this mistake that's festered for decades.  I don't think tariffs are what you think they are- or at least your comments about them here do not lead me to believe you understand them. Tariffs are a tool for re-shoring manufacturing by making imports more unprofitable. That only works if the government also invests heavily in domestic industry to fill the gap. I don't see any government investments to fill the gap; they're literally cutting all the industry support right now.  People are upset because they're being affected by all this. You're right to say they're mad their 401(k)s are shrinking, but, just like a cancer patient, we need to go through the treatment... and it's rough.  To be clear and likely contrary to what you might think I'm saying, I do not support what is going on right now in our government. This is not the cancer treatment the country needed, this is just a shakedown by the insurance company while the tumor continues to fester.",Arkmer,2025-04-05T20:46:52,10
I want the top salaried person at a company to make no more than 20X what the worst paid person at a company makes. Even 200X would be better than now. Wealth taxes disincentivize extreme greed.,j____b____,2025-04-05T20:03:54,9

"Notice that when Dems raise corporate taxes, it doesn’t cause a market crash. Because they do it via the legislative process, something corporations can evaluate and respond to effectively.   Anyway, for the other part of your question: I support taxing the rich, probably through a wealth tax, but I do think the proposal Kamala floated on taxing unrealized gains was problematic.  I also think there’s limited risk in all the billionaires fleeing the U.S. They can and the impact would be minimal. And they would likely still be subject to some form of taxes here as it’s pretty hard to divest 100% from the US economy.  I don’t think either party is perfect, the Dems too often offer weak social progress to avoid economic progress or liberal fiscal policy (to appease their wealthy donors?). But they’re far better than maga.   As others have pointed out, it’s not so much the wealth of the very rich, but the disparity. Income taxes on the wealthiest / top earners are much much lower than during times of economic growth and vibrancy (ie good times). Wage growth for the average worker is not keeping up with inflation and the gap between CEOs pay and average workers is much higher than it used to be and growing. We could fix all these things and the billionaires would still be obscenely wealthy and the rest of us much better off.",BourbonDeLuxe87,2025-04-05T22:00:35,6
"Tariffs are effectively a national sales tax paid by 99% of Americans.  The rich only really care about giving themselves income tax cuts, since income taxes are progressive.  Raising tariff taxes while cutting income taxes is essentially telling 99% of Americans to all pitch in their money in order to pay for tax cuts that primarily go to the 1%.",hryipcdxeoyqufcc,2025-04-08T21:31:48,2
This is exactly right. Tariffs are broad in nature. They affect all companies in a particular industry. It’s like adding water to a bathtub full of toy boats. They all rise together. There is no competitive advantage to be the one submarine in the pond.,Logical-Grape-3441,2025-04-06T09:41:48,2
"I guess my greater point is that whatever ""artificial"" means you use to punish or incentivize companies come with a tradeoff. No matter what tool the government employs to take earnings away from a company, there will be a negative tradeoff that follows. In your response you hint at higher taxes being a net benefit. That is wholly inaccurate, else tax rates would be 100%.",Mental_Bicep,2025-04-06T21:02:59,1
"> Why do iPhones need to be expensive if corporations pay high taxes? Corporate taxes, by definition do not make operating more expensive. Corporate taxes are a tax on profits, not revenues. You might see some try to out greed the taxes, but ultimately, higher taxes on profits actually encourage reinvestment.   No, they just make margins more difficult to reach.  How do they make the phones more expensive?  If the margin is 20% on an iPhone, and you're going to tax 20% of that profit, you're going to raise the prices to ensure that you come out of the transaction with the amount 20% would be before the tax.",ClockOfTheLongNow,2025-04-06T07:02:57,1
"What if tariffs targeted countries that tax and shelter wealth. As a billionaire I can move my money anywhere. Right now US is a favorite spot, but if they raise wealth taxes billionaires will move money to say the Caiman Islands. If we can crack that nut we can then make taxation of wealth at the same level as other industrial countries.",Logical-Grape-3441,2025-04-06T09:53:36,1

"As with so many issues that have been heavily politicized, the truth is usually lost in the rhetorical dust storm. The US loses 10 jobs to automation, for every job we lose overseas. Anybody saying we're going to repatriate heavy manufacturing (as our current President claims) as a source of middle class jobs, is either lying, or woefully ignorant of reality. Any new factories built will need a fraction of the number of employees currently operating factories require, and the pace of that change is only going to accelerate.",BluesSuedeClues,2025-04-06T10:04:08,6

"> I also think you can negotiate improvements to those with free trade deals.  You do not negotiate with the invisible hand.  You simply set the rules and it responds accordingly.

How many billions of dollars have we shoveled into the third world to improve workplace standards and how many tin pot military dictators has it propped up?
