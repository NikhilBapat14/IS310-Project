"Even though my daughter was vaccinated, she had a relatively mild case of the whopping cough. She could have been more vulnerable because she had severe asthma.  For three winters afterward, she coughed until she vomited when she got up, and after she went to bed. This is a typical side effect. I'd hate to see an unvaccinated child suffer from this virus.",George_the_poinsetta,2025-04-22T23:36:10,9
">Whooping cough cases are soaring in the United States, according to new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as the Trump administration’s cuts to federal health agencies and funding destabilize programs that monitor disease and promote vaccination.  >The U.S. has tallied 8,077 cases of whooping cough in 2025, compared with 3,847 cases in the same period last year, the CDC’s data shows. The bacterial illness, formally known as pertussis, spreads easily and is especially dangerous for infants.   ...   In 2024, the number of whooping cough cases in the U.S. climbed to the highest level in a decade. The latest figures show the disease’s spread continues to accelerate — and indicates that the country is backsliding in keeping children from dying of preventable diseases, said Paul Offit, an infectious-diseases physician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia who directs its vaccine education center.  >The jump in whooping cough cases coincides with a worsening national measles outbreak, both driven in part by declining childhood vaccination rates.",brain_overclocked,2025-04-22T21:51:19,6

Hmmm this might be a covid brain damage question coming from you but I’ll try to walk you through it. If one’s immune system has been weakened over and over again it makes them more susceptible to things they wouldn’t need to worry about right ? Follow me. People don’t actually die of HIV/Aids. They die of things like the flu or a cold because their immune systems have been compromised severely….. I don’t know how much clearer I can explain this 😭,finitefuck,2025-04-23T13:05:21,0

Is it ?🤔 how come whooping cough wasn’t steadily increasing in the 2000’s or the 2010’s? It just started because they have weaker immune systems.  Edit: but your theory is that it’s because people stopped getting vaccinated? That doesn’t even make any sense from a scientific standpoint. Because the increase coincides with covid,finitefuck,2025-04-23T11:45:40,-1

"From TFA:     ”Vaccination rates against whooping cough have declined since the coronavirus pandemic, according to [CDC data](https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html): In 2023-2024, the vaccination rate among the nation’s kindergartners fell to 92.3 percent, from 94.9 percent four years earlier.

You aren’t reading the articles friend so I bid you good day.  You are scared lol and I left out the best part about Covid is that almost half of the cases are asymptomatic. So people are fucking themselves up without knowing. You chew on that  Edit: you just don’t want covid to be true. Awww po baby. I’m sorry. It’s reality though 🤣,finitefuck,2025-04-23T13:06:52,0
I literally read your articles. All of them. They don’t prove covid messes up your immune system.     I don’t know who you think you’re arguing with. I’m a hospital worker who worked directly with covid patients during the pandemic. I was vaccinated the first weekend it was available.,Damn_Dog_Inappropes,2025-04-23T13:27:36,2
Do you mask with a n95 or higher?🤔 Covid still fucks you up even if you are vaccinated. 😭 the vaccines types aren’t to the point where they inoculate you from it.   And if you haven’t been masking you’ve had covid a lot which would explain you being scared.  Edit: mainly because people aren’t masking and it keeps evolving. 🤷‍♂️ 👍,finitefuck,2025-04-23T13:37:12,0
"Again, I don’t know who you think you’re arguing with.  I treat covid patients. I wear an N95 when doing so. I am fully vaccinated against covid. At this point, I’m more scared of active TB than I am either the flu or covid.",Damn_Dog_Inappropes,2025-04-23T13:47:07,2
