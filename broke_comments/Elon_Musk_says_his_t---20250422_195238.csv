"He can only serve 130 days/year.  Trump’s been in for 97 days…  So, yeah, this was known from the get-go.  Don’t let the media paint this as anything else, because it isn’t.",cliffotn,2025-04-22T20:44:03,294

"The wonderful thing is that there's no recovering the cancerous government agencies he amputated. There's going to be 4 more years *minimum* before Democrats would even have a chance putting the federal bureaucracy back together, and even then, it's way harder to build things than to destroy them.  Can you imagine how demoralizing that must be if you're a leftist right now? Even if they somehow win in 2028, it'd take more than one term for them to put together what was destroyed. Then the next Republican president can just destroy the agencies all over again!",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-22T21:23:28,-82
"""as Tesla profits sink"". This spin was very predictable. Those in the know know that there was a Model Y refresh that affected sales.  Let's see what happens with robotaxis in June.  RemindMe! 70 days",JackNoir1115,2025-04-23T09:00:09,-2

"If Musk has the time to invest, he can probably circumvent that limit by just putting on a new ceremonial hat and coming back under a different 'role'.  Also... what the left has been doing to Musk and Tesla is disgusting. Even people I thought were my friends are on the Musk=Hitler bandwagon, and think it's trendy and cool that electric vehicles, dealerships and charging stations are getting vandalized and violently terrorized. Or they just ignore it and pretend it isn't really happening, but act like if it did, he deserves it because he's somehow bad.",NoTime_SwordIsEnough,2025-04-23T04:30:27,-34
Call me a stick in the mud but I don’t think spending all our time going back and forth building and destroying government agencies is the best use of our time and money as a country. I’m hoping for a more permanent solution.,MacadamiaMinded,2025-04-23T06:31:03,111

So simply don't rebuild the useless agencies and they won't need to be torn down again.,Buschwick66,2025-04-23T17:07:19,-3
