Trump will throw him under the bus sooner than later.  Wanna bet?,reddittorbrigade,2025-04-22T14:15:57,16
"""Strongly behind"" is a good place to be if you plan on stabbing someone in the back.",MJcorrieviewer,2025-04-22T14:46:12,7
We are approaching “I don’t know him. He might have been a low level Secretary of Defense that got coffee in some meetings” territory.,Tballz9,2025-04-22T14:21:19,7
"Everyone here saying Hegseth is done, I disagree. Incompetence is the primary job requirement for the oranges staff and he’s got that. He’s also a racist misogynistic idiot which makes him fit perfectly on the team.",sadetheruiner,2025-04-22T14:26:03,6
Until it's not conveinant. He'll end up under the bus with hundreds of others Trump has stabbed in the back.,backpackwayne,2025-04-22T14:20:33,3
And the bus passes 'quickly over' some unnamed intern.,Motodoso,2025-04-22T14:14:47,3
Oh he's getting fired,FunkyTown313,2025-04-22T14:29:48,3
Trump is a Russian asset,Draft_Punk,2025-04-22T14:28:49,2
Who was it from the last Trump administration who got fired via a phone call while he was on the toilet? Feeling that kind of scenario coming up.  Edit: it was Rex Tillerson,iforgotmymittens,2025-04-22T14:22:23,1
"""Strongly behind"" sounds like someone is already drafting Hegseth's resignation letter for him.",snoo_spoo,2025-04-22T14:23:41,1
Source are saying he in the process of vetting “the my pillow guy” /s,Broke-Till-Payday,2025-04-22T14:26:02,1
So Trump can sh&@ on him,poppop702025,2025-04-22T14:30:18,1
What’s hilarious about this assuming we live in a rational world is that they walked themselves into a corner yet again.  Don’t fire Hegseth? Look like idiots Fire Hegseth? You just said you wouldn’t. Look like idiots,UncannyCharlatan,2025-04-22T14:39:43,1
My money is on the lettuce.  https://www.spottednews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/petehegseth.jpg,10390,2025-04-22T14:44:41,1
He also stands strongly behind convicted January 6th insurrectionists.,tracyinge,2025-04-22T15:02:48,1
"Gonna start posting on threads ONLY with 20 comments or higher.They be topics I want to give my useless 2 cents on.This.If Elon's not on Trump's right,Vance on his left,and Hesgeth standing behind these 3 dudes as Trump announces a dictatorship,I will be shocked,and revoking my psychic privileges.Trump NEEDS this man to stir chaos for civilians.",LycheePrevious7777,2025-04-22T15:26:53,1
"This is how you know the guy is out by the weekend. Trump did this constantly in his first term. He'd say ""so and so is doing a great job"" or something and that person would be fired within days.",DisMFer,2025-04-22T15:48:27,1
That's why he's standing behind him.,masterchefguy,2025-04-22T14:28:51,8
Why do you think is standing behind him. Can’t push someone under the bus from anywhere else.,Shiplord13,2025-04-22T15:00:10,3
Not even if you gave 100 to 1 odds.,backpackwayne,2025-04-22T14:19:42,3
"You may be right (and, I did upvote you) but, I am smelling a 'very fine man unfairly targeted by THE LUNATIC RADICAL LEFT' whiff on this one. He who dealt it is definitely not going to take any responsibility for the firing...",Stellar_Stein,2025-04-22T17:54:17,1
"Agreed.   Plus, breaking from the 'fake news, anonymous sources, slander' is a terrible precedent for their game.   If anything he'll resign on his own accord; perhaps from 3rd party pressure, but it won't be on Trump's behest.  But I just don't see him getting booted",nerphurp,2025-04-22T14:28:59,2
