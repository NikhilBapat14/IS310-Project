"""We find nothing violent or threatening here. Just passion, loving, and tolerance by regular folks. All the violence and threats are from the right.""  - CNN",chances906,2025-04-17T17:26:18,22
Update:    Looks like they're taking that trash down:  https://x.com/StrictSpeaking/status/1912966386319507883   .   How come the lamestream media hasn't covered this yet?,Ironman650,2025-04-17T17:40:14,10
"It‚Äôs interesting how the left has become empowered to do things like this.  Riots, burning cars, destroying property.. all gets glossed over as ‚Äúmostly peaceful‚Äù yet when it‚Äôs the right doing something it‚Äôs the worst thing since Pearl Harbor and the civil war combined.    You can disagree with everything Trump is doing, that‚Äôs totally fine but it seems they aren‚Äôt even worried about the potential visit from the secret service they‚Äôll get over this, if they‚Äôre even caught. I‚Äôm sure the school is busy scrubbing camera footage, because you know how well stuff like this works for civil discourse.    Meanwhile, you know where you see the most reasonable takes that don‚Äôt agree with Trump? Among conservatives.  It‚Äôs so strange we have things like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like the tariffs, here‚Äôs why..‚Äù as opposed to crowing about bringing an illegal alien gang member back.  It‚Äôs all theatrics with them, and they have to be losing their grip on people.  AOC and Bernie are hopping on private jets to host rallies against the rich.  Do they not see how bad this looks?",chillthrowaways,2025-04-17T16:48:29,14
So if someone was to say make a statue of Kamala Harris with a male organ hanging out of her mouth that would also be considered under the first amendment,Silverado153,2025-04-17T19:38:14,2
"Dude it's unacceptable everywhere right now in the ask us , people are just straight up saying if you voted for Trump, you're a rapist.   Unacceptable.   The thing is Trump would have a much higher approval rating if the news wasn't constantly putting him down. That is the only reason he has a lower approval rating. I'm literally making a list of all the things they keep saying will happen and then don't happen. I have 33 lines so far.",Jumpy-Program9957,2025-04-17T18:43:09,3

If that was a republican school with a democrat president you know the media would be all over it condemning it.,AdagioVast,2025-04-18T05:29:08,1
What's crazy is if people just turned that news off for a week. Not only would they have nothing to say is so bad. But maybe they'd realize their life isn't bad at all,Jumpy-Program9957,2025-04-17T18:43:54,3
That's what I was about to ask you. Did you report this to any media outlets cuz you have proof of it being there before which I'm sure a lot of people don't now.,Jumpy-Program9957,2025-04-17T18:45:05,5
Please do this someone... üòÇ,scram007-3,2025-04-18T16:48:11,2
