"No? The market rebounded some after he said the tariffs would ""come down substantially"". The US lost this trade war before it even got started. He doesn't even know what tariffs are, or who pays them.  Our PM visited the WH today, and when Trump was asked about the 15% tariffs he slapped on us he said ""they have a $2000bn sovereign wealth fund and no debt. They can afford to pay more.""  Literally doesn't even have high school level knowledge of economics. He still thinks it's the exporters (or the country of the exporter?) that are paying the tariffs. It's complete amateur hour.",CurbYourThusiasm,2025-04-24T21:58:59,1
