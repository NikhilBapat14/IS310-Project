71% down and yet they think Musk devoting more time to the company will help? When does that ever help with him? Who the hell are his investors?¬†,gygbrown,2025-04-22T22:02:14,33
I love this for them,OptimusSublime,2025-04-22T22:01:39,38
Corporations and business owners outwardly getting involved in politics is the stupidest thing you can do. Although in Musk's case I firmly believe he got involved because he knew the DOJ and the FTC under Lena Khan were putting huge regulatory AND potential legal pressures against him that he could not skate around. So for him I think he got into politics purely to save his ass.,herewego199209,2025-04-22T22:00:20,29

"The funniest part is Elon pretending his returning attention to Tesla will help and not make it worse. I think he isn't so clear on the fact that consumers across the globe hate him and that isn't going to just disappear, His DOGE idiocy is one small part of why people hate him. Leaving that role doesn't suddenly make him not a hate filled nazi.",Tballz9,2025-04-23T00:25:28,5

Who'd have thought firing your publicity teams and actively alienating your most likely customers would cause your company to lose profits.   I'm sure the trucknut demographic is queueing around the door for a 5 door sedan,count023,2025-04-23T04:35:57,2
"To blame this all on an anti campaign is a discredit to musks poor leadership, his lack of successful vision beyond tax credits, a limited lifespan exclusive product (competitive forces), and bad company financials.

"This should be incontrovertible proof that Musk is actually a moron and not the genius he wants everyone to think he is. He aligned himself with the MAGA world because he hates unions and regulations. In doing so he alienated the majority of his customers which were primarily liberals who want to cut down on fossil fuel consumption. MAGA loons aren't buying his cars, they love their huge gas guzzling representations of their male inadequacy.",Gortonis,2025-04-23T06:43:44,1

"Unfortunately, no.   Musk has a major hard on to make the US currency his own. Thats his dream. To do that, we have to collapse the economy and take all value out from the US dollar.   He‚Äôs very much willing to gamble his fortune on this, especially with a useful idiot like Trump.   Which is exactly what is happening.
