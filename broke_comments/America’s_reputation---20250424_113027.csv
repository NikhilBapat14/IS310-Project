"America is a cross between a laughing stock and a chit show. 45 is off the rails illegally deporting people left and right, firing thousands, defying the Supreme Court four judges that he himself appointed. His administration is a septic tank of racism, homophobic, msyoginst, neo Nazi, and a messed up billionaire and dude is fiddling while America burns.¬†   Man says one thing and hours later says the opposite. He tweet rages in the wee hours of the morning and tweets anger, violent comments and threatens revenge.¬†   If he was anyone *anyone* else the men with butterfly nets would have relocated him to a room with nice cushy walls.¬†",5pinktoes,2025-04-24T11:49:03,25

"‚Äú¬†America‚Äôs bush era global reputation was strong enough that our allies literally joined us in the Middle East with almost no questions asked‚Äù  This is accurate for countries like Canada who had little interest in this fight besides their friendship with the US. But in¬†all fairness, these were coalition wars in part because 9/11 terrified the fuck out of former colonial powers who were worried they could be next because they were *doing the same sketchy shit* in the Middle East that drew the terrorists‚Äô ire toward the US. There was definitely motivation to send a message: ‚ÄúThis is the kind of hell you can expect to rain down on you if try 9/11 in London or Paris.‚Äù (And indeed, London and Paris were the next targets.)  I just find it odd that this narrative of ‚Äúthe world used to love the US so much they followed them into the Middle East‚Äù keeps cropping up recently. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs true for Canada at least, but the major players in Europe (UK, France) independently saw a benefit to invading Afghanistan. Pakistan‚Äôs involvement with al-Qaeda in particular freaked the hell out of the UK. That‚Äôs why European support dropped off when the US turned to Iraq (not as concerning to Europe), but they still stayed engaged in Pakistan and Afghanistan.",Harmcharm7777,2025-04-24T14:17:42,5
"Oh, plenty of questions were asked about America's actions and intent in the ME. There's a reason why they basically went it alone in Iraq, despite the massive support they had in Afghanistan.",TheRealCovertCaribou,2025-04-24T12:53:28,3
