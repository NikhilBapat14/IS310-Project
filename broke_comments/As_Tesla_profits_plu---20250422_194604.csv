"Well I need to get just a few more uncontested contracts for my other businesses, and make sure they are all unregulated, you know the ones that you’re not invested in.   Look I’ve killed nearly all competition in the EV space, so your investments will pan out in the end, so what more do you want.  It was foolish for you just to believe what ever I said before, I’m a kinda funny guy I just go with the flow, what I’m doing is Good for the white Americans.  I’m creating a safe and prosperous future, where It does not matter at what ever level you look, new job opportunities exist, and I’m freeing the public of all the uncertainties for their future status, and creating an environment where they can have free housing, free food all provided by their employer.   Together we are ensuring Americas new position in the world, where as we extend our boarders, we get access to new resources and work opportunities for all true followers  As we expand to new planets we will ensure a pure and nurtured. Environment where people will find them self’s surrounded by like minded folk, without question of their loyalty to the program. Where we will focus on ensuring the future of the human race for the next 1000 years !",nobackup42,2025-04-22T21:19:53,2

"Hahahahahahahahahah.   Lose more money, please.   But don't be fooled, if he was truly dejectedly walking away from this position, he would have made up some story about why it's only happening because of *how much of a badass he is*.

He is tired of wrecking the government and wants to return to his meddling and mismanagement of Tesla.  The man who conceived the Cluster Fuck and Nogo Taxi wants to go back and plaster his toxic personality all over Tesla again and tank sales further.  It is too late for Tesla to divest itself of Musk as CEO and he remains the major shareholder. Tesla cannot hope for Musk to divest his shares in the company because all this would do is collapse its share price.  His deluded fanboy shareholders will hold on until the bitter end but anyone with more than half a brain has already sold up long ago.,iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-04-22T21:21:50,1
