"From my understanding, this is actually moving relatively quickly compared to typical court cases of this level.  Also, this judge doesn’t have much (if any) room for error.  Yes, the DOJ has been seemingly sloppy or unprofessional, but there is no world where a judge gets a contempt charge upheld against a current DOJ attorney with anything short of an incredibly careful, professional (read: non-partisan), ironclad case/justification.   Also, contempt has to be attributed to specific people for specific (in)actions. It seems she is accurately and precisely applying the law, as it should be. Perhaps the judge is sealing the exits.

"No.   It was meant as a means to arm and (later) fund a militia instead of having to rely on an expensive and risky standing army.   Expensive in the sense that standing armies cost a lot of money if you're not fighting a war. Something a new nation with a lot of debt could ill afford.  Risky because a lot of the political upheaval of the day was popular generals using the military to overthrow the government. Something the new Congress did not want to happen.   Militias spread throughout 13 colonies decentralized power. You'll note that most of the Constitution and our three branches of government are meant to spread power around so it's not easy for one man or group to control everything. That's how it is supposed to work anyway.   The Founders did not have the 2A so the people could overthrow the government. They literally just fought a war doing just that. You wouldn't overthrow your old government, to then set up a mechanism that lets you overthrow the one you just made lol.   And every single uprising by the people to fight against ""tyranny"" in the United States history thereafter has been put down by the government.   So the idea of a ""well-armed militia"" stopping overreach by a tyrannical government has historically never worked.

"I can’t think of anything strategically more foolish than armed civilians inserting themselves into court procedures.    Guns are for protecting yourself from imminent violence.  That imminent violence might be pretending to be legitimate, sanctioned force.

"I agree with you and share *a lot* of the frustration (which doesn’t feel strong enough a word).  I hope these judges are cognizant of public perception — we all saw Garland’s problematic slow-rolling under the guise of QA/QC, and now we’re beyond skeptical of the same tactics.    But I’d hate to see public pressure lead to unforced errors here — either by the judiciary or inflammatory reporting that further divides. Even though Garland essentially weaponized accuracy and precision, I don’t want to see us abandon it.  I’m so torn bc I get it. You can’t win if you’re bound by rules and the other side plays by none. “Taking the high road” means nothing if those below you destroy everything in the meantime.  I don’t know. I’m kinda just thinking out loud in this thread.  I admire your “fire”.  But I think it’s obvious that I’m really struggling with the fact that my core belief — that the world (should) reward rule-followers — is part of the problem.",rockbottomgeologist,2025-04-23T11:28:12,2

"And other firms didn't.  ***Harvard***, the most powerful and prestigious school of law, an institution connected to the best attorneys in the nation, didn't.  Hundreds of firms, *hundreds*, plural, are clamoring for an opportunity to fight Trump's abuse of power and extortion attempts.  You'll also note that at no point has Trump *actually* refused to comply with decisions.  He's appealed, he's filed for stays, he's disputed rulings, he's threatened lawsuits, he's called for impeachments (erroneously), he's tried to sidestep, he's pretended he didn't see them or misunderstood them, but everything he does, he does within the framework of the legal system.  He throws temper tantrums when the courts rule against him, but he doesn't outright tell them to go fuck themselves, he *works* ***within*** *the legal system to dispute the decisions*.  That's a clear message that this administration, however corrupt and broken it is, is still beholden to the rule of law.  They clearly don't *respect* it, but their *actions* indicate that they haven't abandoned it, no matter what nonsense he spews online or how loudly he disclaims it.",LuminaraCoH,2025-04-23T06:58:31,5

"Sure. One simple question for you to consider: if the 2nd amendment was *not* set up to prevent the government from preemptively seizing weapons to prevent rebellion (something that England had just done prior to the Revolution as part of the intolerable acts) and was instead ""meant as a means to arm and (later) fund a militia instead of having to rely on an expensive and risky standing army"", then *why is it written as a* ***prohibition*** *on the government*?  That is, if the purpose was to arm a militia, why isn't it merely in Article 1 section 8 under the powers of Congress, like ""Congress shall have the power to arm and organize militias""? Or if you wanted an imperative, why isn't it drafted that way - ""A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, *all citizens are required to keep and bear arms in defense of the country""*?  Instead, the 2nd amendment does only one thing - it **prevents** the government from infringing the right to keep and bear arms. How is that in any way consistent with your theory that the founders put it there ""as a means to arm a militia"", rather than ""as a means to prevent a tyrannical government from preemptively seizing weapons to prevent rebellion as had just been done a decade earlier""?  Can you answer that?",LackingUtility,2025-04-23T21:05:56,1
