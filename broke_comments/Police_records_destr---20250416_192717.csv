"The Tennessee Star learned on Wednesday that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an alleged member of the Central American gang Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) who was deported to El Salvador under President Donald Trump amid legal action claiming the removal was by mistake, was suspected of being engaged in human trafficking by a Tennessee Highway Patrol (THP) officer who detained him in December 2022, leading the THP to contact the FBI for guidance. Within two hours, the FBI ultimately requested the THP release Garcia and the passengers in his vehicle. THP complied with the request.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-17T01:47:25,9
">The court required the ""government to 'facilitate' Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.""  This is such an easy fix. Pick him up in El Salvador and drop him off in Venezuela",BrockLee76,2025-04-16T19:46:05,14
"It’s useless, I had commented for a number of months in the Immigration sub, but today got banned for saying Trump would probably not get impeached for deporting illegal criminals. These Reddit subs have absolutely no free speech whatsoever.",Dazzling_Pink9751,2025-04-16T23:52:08,4
Imagine trying to paint that we should let this person come back to the country.   What a joke.,Vlasma_,2025-04-16T22:14:53,3
He’s El Salvadorian… The moment he entered El Salvador no other country’s government has power to do anything with him but El Salvador.  Is it that hard to understand?,BattleIllustrious680,2025-04-16T21:21:46,18
"See, that makes sense to me, but then that makes me confused why El Salvador President Nayib Bukele said in the oval office on Monday: *""How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States? I don’t have the power to return him to the United States.""*",Doctor_Byronic,2025-04-16T22:38:32,3
"No, it isn’t hard, kinda simple in fact!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-17T01:48:10,1
The only way Albrego Garcia can return to the US is if he A) is released by El Salvador’s president and then smuggled into the US illegally or B) the man is once again released by the El Salvador president and he receives a visa which would fall under Rubio and that would never be approved.  The point is Albrego Garcia will remain in Cecot and the only person who can do anything about it is the El Salvadorian president.,BattleIllustrious680,2025-04-16T22:43:54,2
"I apologize, but I'm still not understanding. If the Supreme Court ordered a facilitation of his return so he can be further processed by the American legal system, then why would his return be considered illegally smuggling? I'll admit that I'm ignorant on extraditing criminals for the sake of due process, but is it normal to issue a visa in those cases?",Doctor_Byronic,2025-04-16T23:09:53,7
Just smash your head into a brick wall cause these people are never gonna get it.,Beware_the_silent,2025-04-16T22:49:05,-4
"No need to apologize.  The Supreme Court ruling ‘facilitate his return’ only means for the US to make it easier for his return IF El Salvadorian president first releases him from prison, then either smuggles him into the US or grants him a visa which has to be agreed by both El Salvador and the US.  The Supreme Court ruling is basically saying we have no power to return him but should the El Salvador president allow it, the US government should make it easier but doesn’t have to because the legislative branch holds no power over foreign affairs. All in all it’s a nothing burger that maintains the status quo.  Trump is in the right and the district judge overstepped his authority and imo should be impeached",BattleIllustrious680,2025-04-16T23:17:44,13
I was always raised with the concept of there being no stupid questions if asked in good faith.  I understand and agree with your sentiment what with this being Reddit and all though,BattleIllustrious680,2025-04-17T02:15:46,7
