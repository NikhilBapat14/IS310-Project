I didn’t even see any margaritas on the table just looked like water in stemmed glasses.,OzoneLaters,2025-04-19T12:22:42,12
That’s such a perfect analogy. This clown is providing evidence he didn’t drink it because the salt rim is intact - as if that matters.   Or as if a photo isn’t a snapshot in time and he could have had a sip after.   Or as if he didn’t travel all the way to El Salvador to meet with a foreign national gangbanger that we deported.,777_heavy,2025-04-19T11:20:32,11
