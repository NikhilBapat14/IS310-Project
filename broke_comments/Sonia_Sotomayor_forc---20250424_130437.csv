Doesn't Alito have a history of tying himself in knots trying to make law fit his perceived narrative?,sugarlessdeathbear,2025-04-24T13:10:15,354
"Didn’t realize parents’ religious views have anything to do with public education 🤔. Here’s the simple truth. Want to send your kids to learn the “Christian” way, send them to a religious school. Keep your religious beliefs out of our public schools. It’s not silencing religion, it’s teaching curriculum that is appropriate to the institution. Public education means everyone benefits. Private/Religious education, a select group gets benefits. Keep your religious views out of public school classrooms.",TonightEducational51,2025-04-24T13:21:31,261

"[Alito] “the book still “subtly” tells kids that same-sex marriage “is a good thing.””  No. It tells them that it’s a thing they might see in life, like a woman voting. A normal thing that has no consequence on them whatsoever, or any other persons other than those directly implicated, and therefore is neither good nor bad. There is literally nothing bad about two people irrelevant to you getting married. YOU have to make about YOU, about your personal beliefs despite there being no impacts on you or your parenting. YOU have to make it about something other than the law and the people directly implicated. And that would be some logic and moral contorting right there!",theEndIsNigh_2025,2025-04-24T16:08:29,1

"The issue is that religious parents are trying to use cases like this as a backdoor to making The Bible the law of the land. It's not. To conform public education to Christian values - insofar as we can make them out from The Bible, which is fraught with contradiction and controversy, by the way - would be a clear violation of Article 1 of the US Constitution, which lays out the separation of Church and State. Sorry folks, but no, our system of public education is not a substitute for or extension of whatever religious education you want to give your kids on your own time. The only laws it must respect are federal, state, and local, NOT Biblical.",SirsatShake,2025-04-24T20:41:15,1
"Ah and Sotomayor struck on exactly the point. Alito and his ilk do not want LGBTQ+ people to exist at all and any book, or movie, TV show, or article that states that they do exist and are equal to anyone else goes against their desire to invalidate all LGBTQ+ out of existence. Thats their goal, make it illegal to even be LGBTQ+.",AlliedR2,2025-04-24T22:16:06,1

Full Agree.  Parents should not get to opt-out their kids from anything at public schools.  Public school curriculum should be set by the teachers and professionals the state pays to do that.  Parents can already teach their kids whatever they want.  At home.,FollowsHotties,2025-04-24T14:03:04,78

So many babies are baptized before they can even say the word no.  However, all children have the right to an education that does not involve gods, angels, and demons. But the children don’t get to decide where they go to school. It’s the parents choice where their children go, and children need to be registered at schools even in public schools, especially if the city you live in has multiple public schools.  And that’s where the whole school choice argument comes in where it’s this Republican red herring that parents should have more access to school choice, but in reality what that means is Republicans want federal tax dollars to pay to fund these private and charter schools. Be they religious or secular. But that would mean funneling government money to fund religious institutions, which is a first amendment violation.",TonightEducational51,2025-04-24T19:24:50,1

You are correct. Unless schools are teaching about religions in an informative way. Ex: teaching about the reformation or islamic golden age etc. And understanding the religions views are important to understand what happened. Or its literally a religions class teaching about various world religions. Then any sort of religious belief should not be taught in schools.   Creationism is a religious belief. Same as eating pork is bad or reincarnation. People are welcome to their beliefs but public institutions should not be spreading them.,evanliko,2025-04-24T22:31:00,1
