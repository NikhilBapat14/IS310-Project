Mum must have been absolutely bonkers for the courts to rule against her. This isn't something that happens here a lot.,lets_shake_hands,2025-04-13T19:23:58,330
Strap a straightjacket on the mother and throw her into a mental asylum.  Weirdo.,Ironman650,2025-04-13T18:29:49,165
Good to hear.  That 12 old would have grown up to be a troubled adult had the mother with munchausen syndrome got her way.,BargainBard,2025-04-13T21:10:38,63

"Thank god.   I remember a Canadian case where the father was sent to prison for refusing to use the preferred pronouns of his own child, while the mother was pushing puberty blockers and received full custody.  Same for the Jeff Younger case.",Critical_Concert_689,2025-04-13T20:10:08,132

Thankfully here its almost impossible. Both the house and the senate have to vote on it then instruct the governor general to do so.  Its legitimately easier to remove a prime minister than to remove a federal judge. We've never removed one in our relatively short history. Its not even possible for the lower house to have the debate since the high court has never even defined the terms for removal beyond 'proven misconduct or inability to perform duties'.  Even 'inability to perform' is likely never possible since all judges are forced to retire at 70 (65 in some cases),[deleted],2025-04-13T22:57:04,25
Im glad to hear that. In America it's almost guaranteed that anyone who sticks their neck out like this judge did will become part of an ethics investigation or some very shoddy legal case from years earlier. Look how they're treating Dr. Haim from Texas Children's Hospital.,OliverMonster1,2025-04-14T07:55:40,6
