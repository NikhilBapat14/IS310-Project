"Fuck off.  Put the shoe on the other foot. If muslims started to push islam on americans, they would be frothing at the mouth.  If you want to be religious. There's church for that.   Just like your limp dick donald. Keep it to yourself.",inactivemember99,2025-04-22T11:12:38,60

"Is he showing children a trading card with the picture from his ""assassination attempt?"" And listen, boys and girls, Jesus saw me and wept he said, ""How did his ear cartilage grow back so fast? It must be a miracle. He must be the chosen one.""  If LGBTQ topics are too heavy a topic for innocent children, I think gun violence should also be too heavy.",Financial-Special766,2025-04-22T11:16:35,17
"If anything, Trump has revealed evangelicals to be a hateful, immoral group uninterested in the teachings of Jesus. So, he has probably had a negative effect on American religious views.",ranchoparksteve,2025-04-22T11:21:57,8
Which is ironic because pre Trump I would've identified as agnostic but nothing has convinced me more this is all random nonsense and chaos more than Trump and am very much atheist now.  But if forced I'll join the church of satan,campelm,2025-04-22T11:14:39,6

"Folks don't get it. He's not religious and he just exploits it, giving lip service for his own benefit... But so do most of his supporters. Even if they go to church, it's not a church that actually follows Jesus' teachings. It's the prosperity-gospel, deep-fried America type of church. They'll eat this stuff up like Easter candy.",addctd2badideas,2025-04-22T13:19:06,3
There's already been a resurgence of Christianity among gen z and millennials.  All thanks to the cancellation of the future so Trump wants to fill the future with even more dread.,dbag3o1,2025-04-22T11:23:40,2

"There are literally zero (0) Christians that voted for Trump, purely because there is nothing in any theology that supports policies such as his.  Case in point, he's showing off a trading card of when he got shot to children at an Easter event with corporate sponsors.   If you're going to take over a religion at least have the courtesy to emulate Christ.",thistimelineisweird,2025-04-22T12:06:38,2

"It's what the people voted for though, until the maga voters can be reasoned with this is what the majority of Americans want. It's very sad to see as a non religious Canadian, my suggestion if you are non religious is obviously leave if you can, but if not buy a cross necklace and post some pics of your wearing it online, having that timestamped  and poated online now will help you in a couple years I'm sure.",ThomCook,2025-04-22T12:02:40,1
