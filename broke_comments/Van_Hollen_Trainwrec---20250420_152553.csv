Ok I'm from Maryland and I've come to this conclusion. Senator Van Holland needs to go on vacation for the next 2 years so we can forget just who the hell he is.  So I don't have to hear his name again. The only thing I want to say about him is he's a total disgrace,Silverado153,2025-04-20T19:48:47,11

Could perhaps stretch treason and call it giving aid and comfort to enemies. Since ms13 have recently been labeled as a terrorist organization. Doubt that would hold up though.,Razzlecake,2025-04-20T17:55:53,15
