So Antisemitism is the excuse to oppress the universities and he stops having an envoy for it in the State department.  That tells everyone that it's just an excuse and he is not working to solve the problem.,thieh,2025-04-22T12:12:08,22
It was never about Jews and antisemitism it was always about Israel and their contributions to the GOP,Agreeable_Crow789,2025-04-22T12:12:42,15

Its almost like Trump doesn't give a shit about antisemitism and is just using it as an excuse to destroy education.,AnteaterPositive6939,2025-04-22T12:38:25,5
But wait- isn’t this the same Administration in which Pam Bondi said any form of Antisemitism will be prosecuted as Domestic terrorism? Make it make sense.,Adorable-Constant294,2025-04-22T12:43:47,4

So those law firms that were going to fight antisemitism are off the hook?,azflatlander,2025-04-22T13:19:18,2
"Of course, Trump doesn't care one bit about actual antisemitism. He's just trying to stifle free speech when it comes to criticizing Israel and his support for them.    Also, let's not forget this, from the same article, ""The White House is also [planning to shut down](https://forward.com/news/706276/education-department-shut-down-civil-rights-antisemitism/) the Education Department’s civil rights office, which investigates campus antisemitism. The department has already laid off roughly half of its staff of 550.""  Short version: antisemitism is not AT ALL important to Trump & Co.",FIlm2024,2025-04-22T17:52:17,2
"A proposed Trump administration plan to drastically overhaul the State Department would eliminate the most prominent job in the federal government fighting antisemitism and replace it with a “Jewish affairs coordinator” focused on Israel.  The role, special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism, is the most senior federal official tasked with addressing antisemitism and its mandate is currently focused on international threats, including antisemitic incidents abroad and stopping efforts to ban kosher slaughter or other legislation that would impact Jews.  Moving the functions to an office focused on Israel and the Middle East could significantly shrink its portfolio and would align with the Trump administration’s efforts to fight antisemitism, which have focused almost exclusively on criticism of Israel and alleged support for Hamas.  The change was one of dozens recommended in a [leaked draft of an executive order](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/20/us/politics/trump-state-department-overhaul.html) first reported by The New York Times Sunday that would also end almost all of the United States’ diplomatic work in Africa and shut down State Department offices focused on human rights and climate change.",forward,2025-04-22T12:07:19,1
