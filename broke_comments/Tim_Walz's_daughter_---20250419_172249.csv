No. Jesus didn’t exploit people for personal gain.  Based on this - It occurs to me that Walz is more like a deported gangster.,dottedoctet,2025-04-19T17:35:18,156

"The people who claim they know the Bible better than Christians strike again.  Not just the clueless comparison but then this....   “I believe in the good of people and like humanity, humans you know deep down at our core like we care about each other but that’s really being tested.”  The Bible tells us human nature is worldly, selfish, and sinful, and we need Jesus to change that nature.",enslaved1,2025-04-20T13:05:56,3
