Good. There should be term limits.   I mean I know he was a D but he's been there a long time and they'll just elect another D in his stead,MichaelPFrancesa,2025-04-23T10:18:28,42
"From Dave McKinney/WBEZ:       Democratic U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin will not seek a sixth term next year, confirming to WBEZ in an Illinois exclusive that he will leave office in 2027 in a long-awaited move certain to set off a massive, intraparty succession fight.  “I’ve decided not to run for re-election. So a year and a half from now, I’ll be wrapping up. I plan on working full-time until that moment, but I’m not going to be waging a campaign for re-election,” Durbin said during an interview in downtown Chicago.  A major reason for his decision boiled down to one thing: his age. By the time a sixth term would end, Durbin would be 88.  “It’s time,” Illinois’ 80-year-old senior senator said. “You observe your colleagues and watch what happens. For some of them, there’s this miraculous aging process where they never seem to get too old.  “Take Bernie Sanders, for example, who’s older than myself, or Chuck Grassley, who still does a town meeting in every county of the state each year,” he continued, referring to Vermont’s octogenarian independent U.S. senator and to Iowa’s nonagenarian Republican senator, who both are older than Durbin.  “But for a number of other people, they’re not so lucky,” he continued. “So, you watch aging, and I try to gauge it to the point where I can walk out the front door. I don’t have to be carried out. I feel that way now. I’m physically and mentally strong. But I don’t want to wait too long and test fate.”  Durbin had kept a tight lid on his decision, sharing news with a very close circle of friends. Durbin notified his staff Wednesday morning that he would not be seeking re-election.

"Good choice Dick.  I will always consider Biden a great president, but I hope between him and Feinstein's very public struggles, democrats are learning that they should retire closer to a normal retirement age, and let a new generation of leaders shine through.",demystifier,2025-04-23T10:21:37,8

Godspeed to Mr. DD.  Excited for my first big contested statewide election here. Might finally have an opportunity to get my foot into some sort of door on one of the gazillion or so campaigns likely to spring up (either directly for Senate or knock-on races for House/other seats the Senate candidates vacate).,hunter15991,2025-04-23T10:47:35,2

"It wasn’t so much as it was toxic, but rather Kirk had been a long time congressman from the northern Chicago suburbs. He was fairly moderate and pretty popular from a wealthy part of the state. This was also in the heels of the Blago scandal where we tried to sell the seat (previously held by Obama who gave up the seat to be president) so there wasn’t really a true incumbent running at that point.
