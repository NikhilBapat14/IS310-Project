"Two things:  1).    This dude has 1.1 Million followers on Tik Tok  2).   Apparently no problem putting 'White people' in the title, but putting  'Black people' in title causes the thread to disappear into the memory hole.",Ironman650,2025-04-19T08:16:13,266
I wonder how many people working in HR or corporate recruiting offices have seen this and will see this sitting across from them every time they interview a black applicant? This is the exact kind of crap that keeps racism alive.,johnnyg883,2025-04-19T09:14:29,225

"""To all of the people who are against Karmelo Anthony, and me as a black man in America — white people I’m telling you, and I’m telling you now, you ever even think to approach me, bully me, harass me — think you gonna be with your twin brother or whatever and do anything to me, I too will pokey pokey poke you as well.”  “Straight to the heart.""  “You all don’t want to end up like Austin,” “Leave black people alone.”",Ironman650,2025-04-19T08:11:40,73

"Yep. I remember when I was attending or later working at summer camp, a few times a summer we would go on a field trip either to like a water park or to a public campgrounds or whatever and the counselors always made a point to say “hey you know especially on this trip you better act right because the people that we meet, a lot of them don’t know any Jews or have never even met one and so how you behave that’s how they’re going to think Jews behave.” and at the time it seemed like pretty standard teacher talk but as I get older I think about it whenever there’s a Jewish person who does something to demonstrate they never had the water park talk. I get livid, like how can you not understand that we are 0.2% of the world population and we have a lot of enemies bent on assassinating our character? How the fuck are you going to throw a swastika brick through a Tesla with the last name Cohen? On so many levels that is just abhorrent. But, ya know, even sane people aren’t particularly rational.   Every demographic has bad actors, I had an ex girlfriend who called them “bad ambassadors” but the unfortunate truth is that when you are a member of a group everyone in that group gets blamed for your bullshit. In my own life I am grateful to have that pressure because it has held me accountable to my values and I think made me a better person. Overall though it’s a shame it has to be that way. And a lot of people on this thread might not think it applies to them, but Christians and even conservatives are persecuted groups as well and so if you are either you should be doubly mad at any fellow one who does something that reflects poorly, and luckily there are so many wonderful conservatives and especially so many wonderful kind Christians and really it’s fortunate that there are many wonderful members of every group because your enemies will use anything any member does to try and destroy you. I think the world would be much wiser place if we found a way to truly teach kids that their actions don’t just reflect upon them.",UltraAirWolf,2025-04-19T13:06:55,38
"Yeah,  but then he could just play the victim card he desperately wants to play. Just like Anthony, he'll provoke a fight, then cry victim.",Rocket_Surgery83,2025-04-19T20:57:07,10
I feel like any competent prosecutor could 100% show this to a jury as proof of premeditation.  He's just looking for any excuse.,EmbraceTheFault,2025-04-19T16:54:30,14
People like these have no place in America which is the melding pot of the world.  Racist and violent threats need to start being met with consequences and if that means expulsion from the country so be it,BattleIllustrious680,2025-04-19T08:16:45,121

"the sad part is how incredibly common this is and it's not considered 'racist'. i see these posts on facebook all the time and I think, ""Surely there must be backlash in the comments from this obviously racist anti-white rhetoric.""  Regardless of how you feel about the case, yet the comments are full of hundreds if not thousands of people supporting karmelo and calling Austin a meth-head? (What?) and drug addict drug dealer gang member.",LectureOld6879,2025-04-19T09:23:11,62
