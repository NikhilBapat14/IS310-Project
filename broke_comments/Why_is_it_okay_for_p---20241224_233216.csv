"*Since 1976, directors serve a ten-year term unless they resign, die, or are removed, but in practice, since Hoover, none have served a full ten years, except Mueller who served twelve years with the leave of Congress.*  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation#:~:text=Since%201976%2C%20directors%20serve%20a,president%20of%20the%20United%20States.  Like many things in the current era, it's only a ""problem""  if a certain person does it.",skins_team,2024-12-27T10:12:42,3
I understand that. My question is why is the FBI director specifically the one position people are so worried about? But no one worries about attorney general.   Isn’t attorney general the head of the justice department and theoretically the overseer of the FBI?  Doesn’t the FBI director report directly to the AG? If that’s the case why is it okay for attorney generals to be chosen by presidents and not fbi directors.,vsv2021,2024-12-27T13:19:27,1
"You have accepted that it's not okay to remove the FBI director, when it's actually normal.   Focus on who is claiming the FBI director position is unique, and take note of what else they say is worth worrying about. You'll likely notice a partisan element rather than a practical objection.   You're requesting a practical explanation, when one may not exist.",skins_team,2024-12-27T13:27:52,2
The Attorney General sets the direction of the Department but doesn't do the work. The FBI Director is closer to the work and changing FBI Directors would interrupt ongoing cases in a way disruptive to the interests of justice. And the Attorney General is a member of the Cabinet. He doesn't get to stay unless the new President wants him to (generally not when the White House changes parties.),DidjaSeeItKid,2024-12-29T12:48:35,1
