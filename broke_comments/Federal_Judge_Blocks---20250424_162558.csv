WHY are we not using Congress?? What are they even doing these days?,MoistCookie9171,2025-04-24T17:03:07,226

Congress needs to step in to stop these judges. They are out of control.,triggernaut,2025-04-24T16:29:10,76
Another activist judge. This is ridiculous.,Long_Jelly_9557,2025-04-24T16:58:23,36

Seems like most of them are standing around scratching their asses.,dottedoctet,2025-04-24T17:09:16,57
Because both houses are a slim majority. Congress is already cumbersome as hell with a strong majority.  The framers didn't design Congress to legislation  at this level because the federal government isn't supposed to have this much power.,akbuilderthrowaway,2025-04-24T17:18:02,52

Congress has be useless since Obama probably before that. To many ways to block bills with filibusters and stuff and it’s basically just a partisan bickering match. Literally the only way they get laws passed is through spending bills cause they have the threat of a shutdown.,Graardors-Dad,2025-04-24T17:11:59,8
"What the f has congress even been doing for the past 3 months?  We have the house, the senate, the presidency, and SCOTUS.  If we can’t get this shit done now, we’ll never have another chance like this.",j3remy2007,2025-04-24T17:12:32,83
"Start sending them to CECOT. There is nothing more “deep state” than an unelected, lifetime-appointed, unaccountable group of judges who have seemingly infinite power to make a 200 year old piece of paper say whatever the hell they want it to say.",smp501,2025-04-24T18:36:31,-18
Is El Salvador open to a trade?  Asking for a friend.,DreadPirateGriswold,2025-04-24T18:36:43,21
That's a key point. The framers weren't really keen on government doing much beyond absolute necessity. The fact that we have as many laws and regulation as we do is a big part of what has gone wrong with the country.,According-Activity87,2025-04-24T17:29:23,39
They have no problem passing laws that give themselves and their friends more wealth and power though.,day25,2025-04-24T21:10:10,8
"Yup, the federal system was designed to only manage the bare minimum of government functions. A lot of the framers of the constitution were against the general welfare clause because it would lead to government involvement in things like education.",Menhadien,2025-04-24T18:03:48,14
SCOTUS is supposed to deliberate about the limits of the authority federal district judges have around the middle of next month. Surely they realize these judges overstepping their bounds has caused them all manner of headaches this year.,social_dinosaur,2025-04-24T18:15:54,21
Because we don't really have those things. I'd be willing to bet only two SCOTUS justices even voted for Trump in the election. And the majority of congress certainly didn't.,day25,2025-04-24T21:19:57,2
