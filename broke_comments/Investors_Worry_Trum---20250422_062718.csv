"They don't call them ""start ups"" anymore in Trump country, they're actually calling them ""shut downs"" because they're not these very big donor corporations who helped lobby for these agendas and they stand will make a lot of money off of their very small business competitors having to shutdown because they're unable to order their inventory for affordable prices (and these big global corporations are just importing them to another country and then moving their ""value added inventory"" here anyways).",postsshortcomments,2025-04-22T07:12:57,2
