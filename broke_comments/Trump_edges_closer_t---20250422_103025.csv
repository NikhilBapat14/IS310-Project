"This will end when Congress passes a veto proof majority to end tariffs. At that point, he will refuse to sign the bill and the constitutional crisis will be on with full vigor. His impeachment and removal from power will be the only viable option at that point.",theflower10,2025-04-22T10:41:10,20
"The hilarious thing is Republicans rail against communism, but the Trump admin is the closest the US has ever got to having a command economy.",Mala_Practice,2025-04-22T11:05:33,12
"Trump is destroying our economy, and the GOP is complicit in its destruction.",veridique,2025-04-22T11:12:35,12
"The edging is worse than crossing in a way, if he crossed it we’d at least have some certainty, instead he’s, “Will I? Won’t I?”",2a_lib,2025-04-22T10:33:09,5
">The last to try was Nixon, who urged Fed chair Arthur Burns to keep monetary policy loose in the run-up to the 1972 election. That political pressure appeared to work, but with disastrous consequences for inflation down the line.  Imagine the inflation when it is coupled with irrational tariffs.",sane_sober61,2025-04-22T11:25:32,4
"A veto proof majority doesn’t need his signature. If he doesn’t sign it, after 30 days it automatically goes back to Congress and they can vote and it becomes law if they 2/3 it",Lantis28,2025-04-22T10:49:18,14

Relying on Congress to do anything is a fools errand. They are beyond useless ,Grumblepugs2000,2025-04-22T11:02:02,2
"How sure are you that he’d leave, or that anyone would be able to make him leave, even if he were impeached and “removed”?",joeco316,2025-04-22T13:02:42,1

"Yes. People don't get this. The damage he's doing is not the tariffs themselves or whether he fires Powell, but the constant vacillation. The economy and pretty much every business needs to have some level of certainty. The irony is that the very thing that trump thinks makes him appear strong (I keep them guessing!) is actually the biggest weakness of this administration.",Kincherk,2025-04-22T11:11:46,2

"If he's removed, Vance would be sworn in and Trump would have no choice but to leave or be hauled away.",theflower10,2025-04-23T06:02:46,1
Many times. If the president doesn’t sign something in the last 30 days of the congressional term that’s a pocket veto where the session ends and kills the bill and doesn’t get sent back because that Congress isn’t in session,Lantis28,2025-04-22T11:19:23,7
"That’s what *should* happen. Congress has no actual way to enforce it though. If the executive branch has been filled with enough trump loyalists he could just shrug it off. Doubt it gets there anyway, but I’m not convinced it would go so smoothly at this point.",joeco316,2025-04-23T06:17:20,1
"Obama didn't invent the pocket veto lol. In fact, his use of it is one of the reasons why Congress *technically* basically never leaves session anymore.",lunacyfox,2025-04-22T15:13:57,1
