"I had hoped that Democrats would begin changing their tune after blown out this election but apparently that will not be happening.   The Trump administration has been far from perfect, but their decisions seem to me to be pro America and American.",atcmaybe,2025-04-17T07:36:04,147
"But yet - George Floyd, Kilmar Abrégo Garcia, the two lowlifes gunned down by Kyle Rittenhouse, Tookie Williams, etc. - all innocent victims and we shpuld remember them and ""SaY ThEiR NamES"".",squunkyumas,2025-04-17T07:23:22,81
 Simple for the leftist worthless media. If it doesn't fit the narrative it never happened. And those still going to them thinking they are getting news are doomed to be clueless pawns of the left,optionhome,2025-04-17T07:17:57,55
The media has always been the enemy of the people. They made George Zimmerman a white man and Treyvon Martin an innocent little black kid so they could twist a hate crime out of it despite Martin being the one who attacked Zimmerman.,MeLlamoKilo,2025-04-17T07:29:49,46
"The final thing she said was ""tell the truth"", which they are constitutionally incapable of doing and they know it.  So they didn't cover it, which is a lie of omission.    Anyone who watched that yesterday knows there is no way to spin it and keep your soul.",Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-04-17T07:42:07,15
Democrats still haven't learned a thing from the election,Siciliantony1,2025-04-17T07:39:34,13

"If aliens landed in New York and they said something that conflicted with the leftist narrative, they would never report the landing.  That's how much of a joke they are.  It explains those times when you speak to someone about significant political news and they have no idea what you are talking about",optionhome,2025-04-17T07:45:29,3
It’s really astonishing the lengths they will go to keep their few remaining viewers in the dark.,cchris_39,2025-04-17T11:48:21,1
They can’t handle the truth.,GoodTee,2025-04-17T11:48:25,1
News headline: “CNN and MSNBC suck balls - more at 11”  This should surprise no one. These two - along with a few others - sold their journalistic souls to the Democrats years ago.,Freespeechaintfree,2025-04-17T09:54:02,0
"The pro-immigration lobbying group Forward US founded by Mark Zuckerberg just weighed in on the ""Maryland Man"" hoax, blasted President Trump's actions as ""far-reaching and extraordinarily harmful"" and demand Kilmar Garcia return to the US",vampirepomeranian,2025-04-17T14:53:18,1
"But the pain of a mother whose child was slain by an ""undocumented immigrant"" doesn't fit the narrative of the main stream media.  They must do anything and everything possible to get their party into office.",Mehnard,2025-04-17T11:14:37,-2
I'm surprised any is even slightly surprised.   Our media is a mess but the only positive thing is that we end of knowing things like this that we wouldn't have just 10 years ago.   What they don't cover is just as telling as what they do.,Key-Monk6159,2025-04-17T16:28:59,-2
Who cares? They’re both irrelevant with the handful that watch already indoctrinated and not changing their views on anything.,Lifeisagreatteacher,2025-04-17T13:51:04,-7
They need a decade out of power before they would begin to think of changing. Even then they'd change the message and not the grift. The Democrat party is over to me after they mandated a medical experiment that ruined my life. They hop in bed with Europe to tear down what makes America great.,kaytin911,2025-04-17T08:15:52,63
"They have no defense, because they don't argue from logic, they argue from self-ordained moral authority. They reject the existence of any external, objective standard for good and evil. In doing so, they assume the role of final judge. That is, they play God. And like any god in a closed system, they've already rendered judgment: the world is divided into the saved and the damned.      This is why they can rally behind an MS-13 gang member with absolute moral certainty while showing not a flicker of sympathy for the victims of Tesla firebombings or swattings. Those victims, in their cosmology, are already condemned. Nothing done to them is unjust, because in their eyes, justice is whatever serves their chosen narrative.       They don't hate judgment. They hate competition. They ONLY CARE ABOUT POWER.",One_Fix5763,2025-04-17T13:23:30,2
"The left hates ""the oligarchy"" while simultaneously gargling down anything the media reports, despite most media being controlled by like 4 companies now. They are sheep.",MeLlamoKilo,2025-04-17T07:30:24,26
Disgraceful but expected.  They truly hate America and its citizens.,BattleIllustrious680,2025-04-17T07:19:37,25
>Simple for the leftist worthless media.   These worthless corporate media empires are dying.  I wish they were dying faster.  These stupid takes on criminals just keeps putting more nails on their coffins.,GiediOne,2025-04-17T09:31:46,2
>The media has always been the enemy of the people.  Add in also the fact that many working in these - so called journal ism jobs - are actually racists and misogynists.,GiediOne,2025-04-17T09:34:38,3

> They need a decade out of powe  which is almost how long it took for republicans (or at least new wave republicans) to change the tune and adopt trumpism.   But I'm thinking once trump is out they're going back to their same old ways of shitty bushism etc.,NuclearOrangeCat,2025-04-17T10:30:37,3
I doubt it if they keep winning under Trumpism. Trump has been training heirs this time for the future of the party.,kaytin911,2025-04-17T10:31:47,8
"All of the neocons from the Bush admin became democrats after Trump was elected in 2016. The stinkin' Cheneys endorsed Kamala, for example.",BadDadJokes,2025-04-17T12:58:21,2
