"Having read up on this fiasco yesterday, I feel like this case isn‚Äôt the cut and dry thing either side is claiming it to be. It‚Äôs a complicated case not only for the dude‚Äôs citizenship status but also him specifically being deported to El Salvador and his alleged involvement with MS-13.  There isn‚Äôt any publicly available evidence that Mr. Garcia is in fact an active MS-13 gang member as far as I‚Äôm aware. The dude has a clean record except for his immigration status being flagged as illegal. From my understanding, Mr. Garcia‚Äôs right to due process was violated.   I‚Äôm all for deporting violent offenders who also happen to be illegal immigrants. However, it‚Äôs also important we don‚Äôt violate people‚Äôs rights in the process. It‚Äôs even more important that we get the job done right. Deporting people who have a legal basis to be here is not a good thing and anyone who says ‚Äúoh well‚Äù should really reevaluate their own beliefs.",Stea1thsniper32,2025-04-15T16:19:42,1697

"Nobody ever wants to admit a mistake or appear to concede. Maybe Trump's trying to prevent establishing a precedent? Who knows. Regardless, his association to the gang, while POSSIBLE, is more likely either a thing of the past or disputable. He's definitely not a threat to citizens. Mistakes happen and will, but digging in just looks cruel, for the sake of being cruel. Trump should bring him back (we all know he could, even if the other country's president says otherwise) if only to deny the Dems the ""victory"" of bringing him back themselves.",Ty--Guy,2025-04-15T22:13:11,65

Democrats can demand what ever they want. But the facts are Garcia is a citizen of El Salvador. He was in the United States illegally and returned to El Salvador. The United States has no authority to tell El Salvador what to do with its citizens.,johnnyg883,2025-04-16T00:02:22,-6

"Garcia lived in El Salvador until he was 17, then moved to the United States without a visa. He moved to Prince George county Maryland and has lived there until he was deported back to El Salvador. He was detained in 2019 because an informant told police that Mr Garcia was a member of MS-13. Then earlier this year he was deported back to El Salvador in violation of a 2019 court order barring his deportation to El Salvador specifically.  Important context here, MS-13 is THE major gang in El Salvador, effectively a cartel. Growing up in El Salvador you would be very familiar with MS-13. MS-13 doesn't have a significant presence in the US as a whole, but Prince George county Maryland is one of the biggest concentrations of their gang in the US. Coming from El Salvador he would know that he was surrounded by members. The Black and red color scheme as well as the symbolism of the bull all play a significant role in gang culture, which is why it was significant that Mr Garcia happened to be wearing Chicago bulls attire.   While wearing a sports team clothing does nothing on it's own to confirm you are a gang member, buying a glass water-pipe doesn't prove you are using drugs either, its just a part of the puzzle. Once Mr Garcia was being faced with deportation he quickly married his girlfriend who was pregnant with his first child (her third). Mr Garcia's council argued for a withholding of removal due to a perceived threat of MS-13, which requires the judge determine if it is more likely than not Mr Garcia would be harmed by deportation. The judge ruled in his favor and the order was granted.   It's important to note, Mr Garcia wearing MS-13 associated apparel when he should absolutely know what that is and that he is surrounded by members is suspicious for a person that is ""in fear for their life"" from said gang. I don't think I would raise my children in the midst of a gang that I personally feared, and after 2019 when Mr Garcia could no longer be legally deported he did nothing to move away from this gang that was supposedly a threat to his life if he were deported. Mr Garcia's actions are more consistent with someone who is either in the gang directly, or regularly does business with said gang than they are with a man with a family in fear for his life.  Concerning children, while it is true that Mr Garcia is the father to three children that wasn't true until 2019, anytime between 2011 and 2019 he had no reason to stay in the midst of a gang he feared. While I understanding moving can be difficult for anyone, if you can make it from El Salvador to the United States you can make it a few counties over to get away from a group that represents a significant threat to your life. Both before and after the Withholding of Removal order Mr Garcia took no actions to secure his own safety, and a number of times did things that he should know would compromise his safety (presuming he was not a member).   None of that means he should have been deported in violation of a court order, but it does call into question the judgement of the judge that issued it. Our immigration system is broken, and while Mr Garcia was never found guilty, he was in the country illegally initially. He didn't try to claim asylum, it was only when faced with the repercussions for his lawlessness did Mr Garcia attempt to work with immigration officials. The circumstantial evidence I provided doesn't prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that Mr Garcia is affiliated with MS-13, but all of the evidence in the OJ trial didn't prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that OJ was guilty either. We all know OJ murdered her and got away with it because of an abuse of the justice system.",Bramse-TFK,2025-04-16T01:35:53,33

"The Court Order someone else shared has some important information.   https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mdd.578815/gov.uscourts.mdd.578815.1.1_3.pdf  The court order doesn‚Äôt mention MS-13 as the gang Mr. Garcia and his family were threatened by in El Salvador. It states that this gang is called Barrio 18.   Barrio 18 and MS-13 were rivals up until around 2012 according to this information online.  https://insightcrime.org/el-salvador-organized-crime-news/barrio-18-profile/  I never said the dude is or isn‚Äôt involved in gang related activities. Just that the information available to the public isn‚Äôt enough to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he does indeed have ties to MS-13. Everything you stated as being ‚Äúpieces of the puzzle‚Äù involving his alleged role as an MS-13 gang member is circumstantial evidence at best.    As I said before, it‚Äôs important that our court system gets this stuff right. People‚Äôs lives can and will be upturned by ICE. Everyone has a right to a fair trial, regardless of immigration status. The fact that Mr. Garcia was deported before all of this complicated legal stuff was sorted out isn‚Äôt a good thing.",Stea1thsniper32,2025-04-16T07:55:38,33
"In an ideal world, the temporary stay would be in place until the court case is resolved. Obviously the defendant could keep the court case going for years which leaves them in a state of limbo so a limit should be in place to prevent such a thing from happening. Again, in an ideal world, the limitation would be judged on a case by case basis. If the defendant has been amicable and provides all information that is required from them but the delay is caused by various legal processes outside of their control then the limit would be longer. If the defendant has been dragging their feet and delaying proceedings for as long as possible and the only reason for the delay is because they know their case has zero chance of them not being deported than the limit would be much shorter.",Stea1thsniper32,2025-04-15T23:13:31,4
"From my understanding, his immigration status is a lot more complicated than that. Yes, he did enter the country illegally. However, he since married an American citizen and was given some sort of work Visa that allows him to stay in country. He had contact with ICE every year since his marriage. There is also a process by which he can get a green card or some other paperwork that allows him to stay permanently because of his marriage to an American citizen. This whole reason is WHY the Supreme Court upheld the ruling that his deportation was illegal.   This whole issue is the result of an overburdened immigration system that until now, was dragging its feet on processing immigrants. In an attempt to speed up the process. Corners are obviously being cut which means mistakes like the one involving Mr. Garcia will become more and more prevalent. Like I said before.
