It shouldn't be legal which is why trump has faced a bunch of lawsuits about it. The Republicans in congress are fine with letting musk do the dirty work so they can claim no responsibility for the fallout.,CaptainLucid420,2025-04-01T20:35:04,119
"It isn't, but the current SC is in line with the philosophy that allows these cuts.  They would get real active if a democrat was doing something they disapproved of, but will remain weak as water when a republican is doing something they agree with personally.",tosser1579,2025-04-01T21:59:19,19
"According to the US Constitution, Congress allocates the funds. The President can spend no less and no more than Congress allocates. The President is not in charge of spending, the people are.  The President is in charge of taking that money and using it, deciding how to best implement what Congress wanted with the limited funds available.  A veto is the refusal to sign a bill from Congress into law. Deciding how to spend the money is a totally different thing.   What if Congress says use the money for X, but the President uses the money for Y instead. Who will stop him? the Supreme Court? They are under attack as we speak.",billpalto,2025-04-02T16:53:32,5
"You cannot try to rationalize the actions of this administration against laws and precedents. They don’t care about the law. It’s that simple. Their actions don’t have to be legal and they don’t care if they are challenged. This administration is undertaking literally dozens of illegal actions per day. So many that we will never, ever be able to properly litigate them all.",VP_of_Lasers,2025-04-02T04:19:16,10
Your premise seems to be that DOGE is a lawful organization.  I disagree with that premise.,Cheap_Coffee,2025-04-02T06:52:02,7
The question is no longer “What is legal and what isn’t?” The question is “Whose going to stop him when he does blatantly illegal actions?”,thatoneboy135,2025-04-02T07:15:04,2

nothing that he is dong is legal.     People will have the right to sue him and DOGE..     Trump will give him a pardon to avoid any lawsuits.,SevTheNiceGuy,2025-04-02T14:15:00,2
"Nothing is “illegal” when a president becomes a dictator.   I never thought I’d see the day that Republicans and conservatives willingly ignore the Constitution, the separation of power, the rule of law, and the foundations of this country laid down by our founding fathers  in favor of a dictatorship of one man.   I now know all that talk by conservatives and so-called “patriots” about protecting the “Constitution,” “rights,” “freedom,” and “patriotism” was just bluff and rhetoric. I now know they don’t ACTUALLY respect those things, only when it’s politically advantageous for them.   It’s unreal how they are literally preaching against the judiciary, the 3rd branch of government created for the PURPOSE of ensuring laws and actions enacted by the other two branches of government are constitutional and that constitutional laws are being followed.   It’s the RESPONSIBILITY and JOB of Federal judges and the Supreme Court to review and reject laws, policies, or activities by EVERYONE, INCLUDING the legislative and executive branch BUT ESPECIALLY the PRESIDENT of the United States. This country and its Constitution was DESIGNED to prevent kings and dictators from coming into power. There were supposed to be checks and balances so that no one branch of government but especially one PARTY or LEADER becomes too powerful.   Our Founding Fathers would have been HORRIFIED by what Trump is doing and his complete disregard of the constitution and the rule of law. He’s rejecting both and trying to place ALL power and authority in his hands. He is LITERALLY trying to become a king or dictator and Republicans just don’t seem to care. It’s UNREAL   for exercising their RIGHTS, POWER, AUTHORITY and RESPONSIBILITY",Ex-CultMember,2025-04-02T15:58:48,2
"DOGE is not cutting things that were itemized in an appropoiations bill. For most of the executive branch congress gives a specific pile of money and a goal toward which it can be spent. It can be as specific as a building a bridge or as broad as promoting goodwill toward our country abroad.   In the case of the bridge, a president has to get it built unless some conflicting law or treaty prevents it.  However according to the ""Take Care"" clause, he is bound to be responsible with the money and is not obligated to spend all of it. Having a 20 billion dollar budget does not mean you have to spend 20 billion. If he could do it for a mere 20 million, he should. However he may not spend the remaining budget on anything else.  In the latter case with a broad mandate the executive department has great discretion when it comes to specifics. For example USAID. The vast majority of their spenting is left to the agencies discretion. They can spend the money however they see fit within their mandate, with the exception of items specified by congress. They essentially have two pools of money. One for programs mandated by congress, if any. The other to spend at their own discretion.  It is the second pool that DOGE has been going through with a fine tooth comb. Every program funded by that pool of money is at the discretion of the executive branch. Congress essentially gave them the job of picking the specifics on how the money would be spent.   And Due to the ""Take Care"" clause, the President has the duty to make sure that the money is spent wisely. And while your opinion of what is wise may differ from his, it is the job he was elected to do.",Far_Realm_Sage,2025-04-02T12:03:20,1
"As I understand it statutory requirements (those laid out specifically in law) are being adhered to, to the letter. However, Congress has the habit of being vague about how the funds are to be spent to run departments' administrative functions, leaving the method to execute the tasks that Congress appropriated funding for to the discretion of those departments. Anything not specifically required by law in a department is fair game as long as the money goes to the public purpose it was appropriated for. On top of that, some of the purposes themselves are vague. That adds even more latitude.  tl;dr - Funding bills have been vague enough that most of the structure (and to a more limited degree, purpose) of executive branch departments is merely traditional, not legally required.",255-0-0-i,2025-04-01T22:29:08,-3
"I don't know. I'm not a legal scholar but I'm on reddit. Hearing how department staff has barred doors to prevent DOGE from entering and mass-firing entire departments makes me wish they did it in a nicer, more thorough and transparent manner.",SalamanderCongress,2025-04-01T20:22:28,-5
"Yeah, what we’re seeing is that anything can be legal as long as no one cares to stop you. The Republicans in congress are completely fine with what Trump is doing, we have yet to see if the lawsuits will be enough to stop it or not.",cakeandale,2025-04-01T20:44:44,39
"> I never thought I’d see the day that Republicans and conservatives willingly ignore the Constitution  i used to think this, but then i read more American history as well as the history of conservatism generally.

"I'm sorry, you're mistaken that doge is respecting congressional mandates. Just to pick one example since you mentioned USAID: The READ Reauthorization Act of 2023 (H.R. 681/S.41) mandates USAID funding to support international basic education. 100% of USAID basic education programs were canceled and the proposed reorganization of foreign aid completely ignores education.      You can debate whether the US should support literacy in Africa (I think it's a wise use of money, personally). But it's clear the presidential administration is using an unconstitutional line-item veto to accomplish its goals.",wastingzaman,2025-04-03T05:04:04,2
"I don't remember ""gut USAID"" in any of Trump's campaign rhetoric. Did that come after or before ""They're eating the dogs""? Maybe that's not what he was elected to do?",BluesSuedeClues,2025-04-02T14:31:06,1
"While I may not agree with everything regarding DOGE, I will say they have found many discrepancies Congress should've been taking care of to begin with. I think senior management of some agencies got complacent in their jobs and now a lot of it is coming to light, especially in regards to spending.",No-Wish977,2025-04-02T15:45:07,-2
"This isn't really true. The Institute for Library and Media Services was created by law and its entire staff has been put on leave. Obviously, it can't enact the mission it was lawfully created for with no active staff. Dismantling it is not legal. Just one example of hundreds.",SoupOfTomato,2025-04-01T23:35:24,19
"The ones who aren't fine with it are keeping their heads low and their mouths shut, hoping to duck Trump's wrath.  ""I would just get replaced by someone even worse"", certain Republican senators are allegedly saying to their colleagues across the aisle.",ColossusOfChoads,2025-04-02T02:55:16,11
"The judicial branch doesn't have any way to enforce its rulings against the executive, it's all based on respecting the constitutional order. If the government just says ""No, I don't think I will"", there's nothing that can be done about it if Congress isn't willing to impeach because of that.",HammerTh_1701,2025-04-02T06:58:48,7
"He campaigned on DOGE and eliminating wasteful govern spending. While you can debate the merit of a few things that got the axe, a large chunk is obviously things no reasonable taxpayer wants their tax money spent on. Like indirectly funding terrorists.",Far_Realm_Sage,2025-04-02T16:10:21,-4
"The problem comes in that specific positions beyond (in most but not all cases) the top 3-5-10 are not established by law, they’re created by the agency and then Congress gives the agency what amounts to block grants of payroll dollars for specific functions.     There is no legal requirement that all appropriated funds be spent, and because no legally established positions are being eliminated it’s fully legal. Super scummy, but fully legal.",DanforthWhitcomb_,2025-04-02T00:22:44,-4
"Nobody was funding terrorists. You are not the voice of ""reasonable taxpayer""s. The idea of ""DOGE"" didn't even appear until the end of his campaign and ""eliminating wasteful govern spending"" was not a theme of his campaign.   In his first term, Donald Trump added more than 7 trillion to the national debt, more than any Presidential term in American history. Anybody who thinks a man with 6 bankruptcies under his belt cares about fiscal responsibility is a fool.",BluesSuedeClues,2025-04-02T17:14:06,2

"Hello. My Administrative Law class was just discussing a similar topic and it got me thinking about something I planned to address in class. If Trump has the Senate & House, will he have the votes to have Congress authorize DOGE as an official agency and create powers & authority for it? That way, everything it is currently doing will be legal. I will assume there will be a sub committee for oversight. Just a thought. Please correct me if my thinking is off.",No-Wish977,2025-04-02T15:41:31,0

"> If Trump has the Senate & House, will he have the votes to have Congress authorize DOGE as an official agency and create powers & authority for it?

"I see. It's like a loophole. The way I'm seeing it, and please correct me, is Congress creates the agency but since its federally funded, the President has a right to know where the money requested for said agency is going and how it's being spent?
