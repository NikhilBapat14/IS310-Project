"And let me guess, he will compensate the loss of state revenue by taxing us who live there to make up the difference? All the while proclaiming he’s the best person for the job and for the presidency in 2028. He’s a used car salesman",1BroadLyte,2025-04-19T07:50:58,87
Was wondering when Hollywood would have too much of their liberal practices to stand themselves staying.,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-19T07:37:25,51
"Amid a sharp rise in the number of celebrities moving out of L.A. to places like Texas and Florida, industry workers have now raised the alarm about the stark decline in the number of entertainment projects being carried out in Hollywood and throughout California.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-19T07:47:07,21
"I’ve said it for years and even Spielberg admitted it:   Hollywood and the film industry is dead. It’s long left its last golden era. It’s a joke now, and totally lost its way.",ITrCool,2025-04-19T08:55:14,39

Grew up in Detroit in the 70s.  It was such an amazing place back then.  How I miss when we were the motor city of the country.  .    I hope HellyWeird goes bankrupt.  Move those overpaid woke joke actors to China where they belong.,Ironman650,2025-04-19T09:45:39,7
"It doesn't help that a good part of the most fancy neighborhoods, those who paid more taxes than the others, got burned to the ground.   All rich people move elsewhere, an entire tourist industry that burned to the ground along with the buildings.",Juract,2025-04-19T13:58:11,4
are they suggesting that detroit has problems?,TooHotTea,2025-04-21T08:40:18,1
They will.  Especially since the Texas senate just passed a filmmaker incentive.,dont-CA-my-TX,2025-04-19T07:53:55,78
"The film industry being in one little corner of SoCal was part of how they maintained their traditional power structure, actors aren't going to have to keep their individual thoughts locked away in a vault anymore if they're working in Texas.  One of the first things that will change is that ""you'll never work in this town again"" will stop being a thing, because instead of 5ish brands that all operate the same way it will end up being 20+ brands that all go different ways not just on the surface but also in how they operate behind the scenes.  Texans might have a hard time understanding, but in California a person *can* be left with no place to work despite a decade in training a decade volunteering no firings and no criminal history. People just don't have money to pay - in the 00s and 10s I'd get a bounced paycheck then I'd run door to door asking for work then I'd end up with a shitload of workforfree offers after I had already been working for free many years on top of my excess schoolings.  The same burger joint that takes 3 weeks to set up in Texas takes 3 years in California, filing for a permit is like writing a letter to Santa in February and then even once you have all your permits the logistical situation is stuck waiting for the First of Octember. This makes businesses rare, which makes their owners all-powerful. As a side note it also means everyone has to drive too much to run their basic errands, in an area where there's not enough roads and too many houses (so it's too late to expand the roads.)  In California, if your sleazy monopoly/3-identical-competitors boss doesn't like you then you're out of a *career.* In Texas, if your boss is a pos you can become his competitor and run him off the road by legitimate means in a matter of years. In California your former boss will sue you to keep you from getting off the ground, and it'll be like a David vs Goliath fight except that there's no miracles here anymore.  From my time working in a law firm, I saw fight after fight after fight being given up by the good guys because the bad guys had all the money - sometimes because they robbed the rest of the deceased rich guy's relatives out of their inheritance to *get* that money. Trying to fight a crooked system from inside the courts was a waste of years plus years worth of money, for anyone who tried.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-19T08:29:27,52
"Texas, Georgia, Florida, no doubts are in the filmmaking studio crosshairs.",ITrCool,2025-04-19T08:50:21,7
"I kinda hope they do. I get there’s a lot of bullshit that could come with it, but Texas will always be Texas and maybe the new scene could be something better than Hollywood.",UltraAirWolf,2025-04-19T12:49:01,4
"That might be a great thing though. I imagine they would align with the demographic there and not try to change Texas. They will not change Texas lol, they will be the ones making changes. Instead of pushing the same woke narratives they might get back to storytelling the old fashioned way, with integrity and not pushing crappy ideology.",Tarantula_Saurus_Rex,2025-04-19T08:07:11,3

"“Because the bad guys had all the money”  ….and all the politicians for the state in their pocket by being huge donors, so it’s become exceedingly difficult to take them down via legal means.",ITrCool,2025-04-19T08:52:44,17
"Maybe the can go to Bollywood. OR how about they all go to China and use slave labor on the sets so we can have cheaper movies.  In my opinion they are all, along with the music industry, just a bunch of court jesters and we give them too much as it is.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-19T07:57:20,17

"One of the law firm's clients had a long-running BS lawsuit against him who didn't like that his company was competing with the other guy's company. Then, all of a sudden, that enemy's best buddy became DA - instant jail.  People suing the school district had magnetic trackers attached to their cars that were only located because one of the lawyer's personal friends happened to run an auto mechanic shop that can lift cars. The law office was broken into and an attempt was made on the safe beneath the desk, *right after those trackers were put into it.* People suing the **school district.** (The district fired people in sweeps for sketchy reasons, while people who were *caught* draining all the special assignment money out of the pool and doing none of the work kept their jobs. Students were stuck year after year in lord of the flies violence while a guy with six alleged jobs reads a magazine someplace else, because the school system's entire purpose is paying buddies.)  A person does not need to be *elite* to be *connected* \- there's a favored side and a disfavored side of every little group, whether the guy in charge likes you more or likes the other one more makes all the difference. (Instead of quality of work or content of character.)  The move to Texas changes all of this - it also takes away the economic power Californian lefties brag about after yesteryear's righties built it.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-19T09:01:13,15
"And NO I don't go to movie theatres. I try and limit my movies and series. It is not easy because other than getting on political talk forums, I watch TV.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-19T07:58:26,4
