"As a Canadian, I have to say [the partnership China](https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/trumps-tariffs/article/china-says-it-wants-to-partner-with-canada-to-push-back-against-american-bullying/) is proposing with our country looks better every day.   > Wang ‚Äî whose office requested the interview with The Canadian Press ‚Äî said that China and Canada appear to be the only countries taking ‚Äúconcrete and real countermeasures against the unjustified U.S. tariffs‚Äù imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. ‚ÄúWe have taken notice that, faced with the U.S.‚Äôs unilateral bullying, Canada has not backed down,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúInstead, Canada is standing on the right side of the history, on the right side of international fairness and justice.‚Äù  China understands 'elbows up' is the way to go with the orange shitgibbon and his MAGA twats.",biscuitarse,2025-04-24T07:00:56,8

Yeah I noticed the futures market started cratering about 3 hours ago and that's when this story was published.  Every time something like this comes out it causes basically irreversible damage because it proves that Trump is literally just saying there are proposals and negotiations but the entire world seems to have decided it's time to shut America out.,Round-Rule5494,2025-04-24T06:55:46,4

"What incentive would China have to sit down for negotiations? Over the last month, Trump has publicly shown that he will fold at the first sign of pushback and come crawling back with his tail between his legs. With regards to China, he has already said that he will surrender as well, as he's done with all the other countries he wanted to put tariffs on. China can just sit this out while Trump humiliates himself and the US for a bit longer until he inevitably caves.",OnDrugsTonight,2025-04-24T07:00:23,2
">In the weeks since the U.S. president first slapped sky-high tariffs on China, Beijing has responded with defiance. A spokeswoman for China‚Äôs Foreign Ministry posted on X footage from 1953 of Mao Zedong promising to fight to the end against U.S.-led forces in the Korean War. ‚ÄòWe are Chinese,‚Äô she wrote. ‚ÄòWe don‚Äôt back down.‚Äô‚Äù",rapidcreek409,2025-04-24T07:35:29,2
The ability of China to take any pain cannot be underestimated.  Americans are privileged and soft.   It won‚Äôt take long for Americans to be up in arms over the effects of this totally ill advised policy.,Dach2k3,2025-04-24T08:35:18,2

"Id love to understand the mental gymnastics they are basing that on.  Even if it were true (Which it's not), China will be able to squash any upheaval among its citizens and they clearly have a scape goat for any turmoil with Trump being the aggressor.
