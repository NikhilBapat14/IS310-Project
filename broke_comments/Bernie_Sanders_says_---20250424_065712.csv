"No one talks about the biggest issue today that lead to the failure of the Democratic Party. The absolute onslaught of lies, propaganda and fake news. How do we deal with this? For example I watched Fox News cover the Kilmar case, they called him a gang member and a terrorist. They didn’t mention the Supreme Court decision or lack of due process. I think we need to start suing the pants off these organizations and these “journalists”. You want to lie about post birth abortions. There needs to be harsh legal recourse for this.",johndoe4sho,2025-04-24T10:39:04,237

"I'm thinking about when Kamala Harris pitched a benefit for first-time homeowners - and then added to the campaign pitch that it would only be for people who had paid their rent on time for two years, and would be smaller if you weren't a first-generation homeowner.   *Why would you say that?* It's not like this is a bill that's been through committee and all, so no one knows what the eligibility rules will end up being. So why would you make a big populist promise in a way that prompts large numbers of people to think ""well never mind, fuck me then""?   If they want to win (something I am not always sure of), Democrats need to offer a lot more ""you, personally, will get value for your tax dollars"" and a lot less ""don't worry, we won't spend your tax dollars on unworthy mooches such as yourself.""",pervocracy,2025-04-24T07:25:25,710

"Gotta keep in mind a good portion of the working class believed the lie about Haitians were eating pets and think trans people are making women and the sports men carved out for them disappear.  Can’t say people aren’t listening if we aren’t hearing what they’re actually saying.  The Democrats lost, but the maga christofashos won with the red lining Birther at the top of the ticket.  Don’t let them hide behind “economic anxiety” while they’re winning the reds with ads calling Kamala Harris a communist and wearing the average voter down with “I’m tired of both sides arguing about culture war (civil rights/social safety nets/environmental conservation issues usually) stuff”.  I’ve heard so many rational people say they don’t like unions and they don’t like paying for other people’s children. Keep that in mind too.  And oh my gosh guys the mind fuck goes deeper because a lot of folks think this is a Christian nation although they’ve probably never read the Bible and now that the Jesus that they’ve been lied to about all these years is “too woke” they don’t like him anymore but hilariously enough that lines up fine with the actual Abrahamic god of the Bible because he’s  a racist, slaving, genocidal, misogynistic, gaslighting whackadoo.   This is in addition to generations, in their holy houses, being “groomed” since the 1930s by oligarchs and church fathers to associate anything *New Deal progressive or needing to raise taxes for it* with satanic godlessness.   It took a while to get here, and they may not have thought it would be Trump, but the rightwing fear generator “paid off”.   For some of us, social issues aren’t existential made up “identity politics” and the right always wins on identity politics when they do win and we just come in later to “politically correct” it by calling it moral majority economic anxiety or something like that for them.

The Dem platform and polices have always been **far** more friendly to the 'working class'.

How do they appeal to people who hear “that are eating cats and dogs” and doesn’t have any logical thought in their brain about “why are there no missing dogs or cats and how do thousands of dogs and cats go missing without any of us noticing and why is it only happening with Haitian immigrants in Springfield Ohio”?  Surely telling them the truth just makes them even more mad. Telling them they are right to be scared makes them want to side with the one trying to “fix” the problem and democrats KNOW there is no problem to fix.

It’s not that Bernie isn’t right, the dems do need to take a more social approach to their policies and find solutions to alleviate working class and middle class issues.   BUT. The real problem is that the working&middle class  failed to pay attention. Are you kidding me? They really sat down and thought and believed what the GOP candidate was promising, despite having already seen him in power and how not just useless, but outright damaging he’d been in times of real crisis???

"Just because people are working class, that does not mean that they base their votes on working class issues.  Look, I really do like Bernard. But one of my long-standing gripes with him has been that he consistently tries to paper over the poor behavior of white working class voters with economic excuses.  Yes, the pain of the working class is real but it's not like that's the key thing driving their voting behavior.  Biden was the most pro-union president in decades. He stewarded a recovery where lowest wage workers had the strongest wage growth. walked picket lines with union workers. He also passed major pro-manufacturing bills, protected Teamsters' pensions, worked behind-the-scenes on getting better sick leave for rail workers, etc. He forgave student loans and slashed insulin prices. He gave Bernie a [seat at the table](https://www.afscme.org/blog/saunders-named-to-economic-task-force-set-up-by-biden-sanders) and did most of the things Bernie suggested.  Harris was going to give tax credits to first-time homebuyers and to small business owners. She was going to make home health care affordable for seniors.  And yet these working class white people instead chose someone who is going to demolish unions, dismantle the safety net, undercut worker protections, and otherwise change their lives for the worse.  Maybe Bernie understandably wants to distance himself from Kamala's failing brand of Democrats. And I get that.   But he needs to take stock of the fact that Biden/Harris took heed of much of his advice and it still didn't deliver these white working class voters. And maybe it is a big messaging problem, but that does not mean Dems didn't listen to the working class.  So maybe he should at least entertain the fact that other factors might be at play.",Infidel8,2025-04-24T11:08:14,11

There was a refusal to do anything about it except pontificate about the economic policies working wonderfully and soft landings. Meanwhile the middle class and the working class got screwed. The fed saw the increase in wages that was occurring in 2021 giving Manny their first taste of financial freedom as an existential threat to the economy. Not the PPP loans that were then forgiven but the rising wages. Meanwhile wages had been stagnant since the 1970s. This is not by accident. The fed revealed that this is part of their strategy.

John Steinbeck said it best:  >Socialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat, but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires.  This is why we defend them.  Because we believe that if we work hard enough, we will be like them just as they worked hard to get their due.  Bernie's message does not vibe with the American Dream.  Of course the irony is if it's just hard work, Zuck, Bezos, and others would be able to recreate their success.  Because it is very re-creatable and repeatable.  So as a social experiment, let's have a one-time wealth tax and see if they are able to work hard to do it again, needing to accumulate capital again.  Because they already have the talent and network.  In fact, we are not taking anything away from them in taxing their wealth.  We are providing an opportunity to build greatness again.",cupidsodyssey,2025-04-24T14:10:53,1

Realistically, most people are working/middle class with little time, energy, or disposable income to be able to prioritize anything besides ensuring that they and their families are fed and clothed.

">Basically “this is what you get because you’re Australian” no means-tested garbage for things like healthcare or any of their election pitches. Everyone gets it.  The conservative media poisoned this idea in a few ways.  The most clever was talking about ""entitlement"" programs, which is accurate in terms of public policy jargon.  We have a lot of entitled (in the sense of being a self important jerk) people in our society, and it was an easy leap to extend the meaning of the word.  The second way was by claiming that illegal immigrants were using these programs, which they aren't.  In fact, they pay Social Security but will never collect it.  There are social costs like emergency medical care, but that's not what they scream about.    The underlying root problem is simply racism.  A huge percentage of our country would be very happy with ""healthcare for everyone except black people"".  They would rather deny themselves proper care than give it to blacks.    President Johnson in the mid- 1960s called the game, and it hasn't changed:  ""If you can convince the lowest white man he's better than the best colored man, he won't notice you're picking his pocket.

"The problem is that tearing things down and rebuilding them is not a realistic plan. Improving existing things is a realistic plan, but it’s not nearly as enticing of a message. Tearing things down and starting over is an enticing message in theory, until you actually experience what it’s like to have a major institution torn down.   It’s like buying a fixer upper house. 99% of the time it’s going to be cheaper, easier, and better to renovate the house. It’s going to be extremely rare that you need to raze the house to the ground and rebuild it from scratch. That’s going to take so much time, so much money, and you also have to figure out where to live while you’re doing it. And it also assumes that once you rebuild it, the work stops, which obviously it doesn’t. The new house will also have problems that need fixed and require routine maintenance.   But it’s a cheap and easy message to try and convince people that tearing things down is the best solution, and a lot of it goes back to propaganda and education. People have no idea the breadth of what these institutions actually do. Hell, the people destroying them currently have no idea what they do. That’s why all these stories come out about them firing a bunch of people then realizing, Oh shit, we need to hire them all back, they actually do something important.  Ironically the only thing Republicans have in common with their base is that they want to tear things town, but very different things. Their base want cheaper food and cost of living and want anything torn down that is impacting this.

"That excuse is old—and I’m saying that as someone who believes that it was entirely stupid for the country to turn on him for not fixing the whole country in two years when it took us centuries to get into this mess.  Congress passed the Laken Riley act within 48 hours of trump becoming president this time with bipartisan support from the democrats, essentially allowing trump to circumvent due process for suspected illegal immigrants. And just the month before, congress passed the TikTok ban so fast it got whiplash. Not only that, the GOP had laws already drafted, waiting to be triggered by events like certain Supreme Court precedents being overturned. And the things trumps are doing now because the GOP published the plan and made it widely available way  before they regained power.  Are you really saying nobody in leadership could’ve done anything to prepare to have a majority in between the time they were elected and actually had a filibuster proof majority? Do democrats just never work on bills or plan anything outside of the time they have power? How does that excuse bait and switch things, like campaigning on abortion protection and then plainly telling women’s rights activists that the issue is simply “not a priority” right before they lost to Supreme Court for a generation and now this thing democrats didn’t care about is the most important thing?  Them only getting that one thing done in the month they had a once in a generation opportunity means that they did not plan to wield power and did not plan for opposition.   We cannot continue to make excuses for this sort of piss poor planning and keep defaulting to this idea that a supermajority composed of moderate Dems are going get us out of this mess when they have done nothing but cement us to the sinking ship. Moderates dragged out ACA negotiations, they dragged out the infrastructure bill, the negated abortion protections, they negated education reform, they dragged out prosecuting trump and now they are straight up giving trump the green light on some of the worst legislation we’ve seen this century.

"Oh boy, your post is really scary to read. Because it shows how many people on our side are so out of touch that they don't even understand what Republicans are selling to the electorate, much less how's it's working.  People in America have hated the status quo for decades. I would argue every election since the 1980s, the more anti-establishment candidate was the winner. The root cause of this dislike is economic and tied to inequality and the death of labor in the US--Nixon and Reagan essentially killed the American economy and we've been scavenging its decaying corpse ever since. The last two successful Dem presidents (Bill Clinton and Obama) ran as anti-establishment outsiders on economic change platforms and they won. Every other Dem has, for bizarre reasons, positioned themselves as pro-establishment defenders of the status quo while not acknowledging the clear issues stemming from income inequality. We don't acknowledge the grievance and have been almost exclusively running coastal lawyers turned Washington insiders. Republicans do recognize the grievance and weaponize it against us, especially while running anti-establishment outsiders. Aside from Romney, who was maybe the mathematically worst choice they could've gone with in 2012.   That's what they've been running on for *decades*. The social messaging is also very important here because it sets up a ""regular folk with everyday problems vs out-of-touch Washington elites who know nothing about your struggles and only care about their social causes"" narrative. They bait us into brawling about social issues so they can turn around and say ""look, this is all Dems care about"". And it works every time because we don't actually have an economic platform or any vision we sell. Republicans' economic talk is all snake oil stuff, but they have an actual (scam) product they're trying to sell. And we have jack shit beyond a bunch of dry, coastal elite, low-charisma bureaucrats defending the status quo.  It terrifies me that people on our side do not understand this. Because we've been losing harder and harder to this same trap the entire 21st century--aside from when Obama ran against the party as a dark horse against the pro-establishment candidate the party favored. This dynamic should've been obvious more than two decades ago, and it's only gotten more unignorable with each financial crisis, where inequality gets worse and QoL for regular working folk gets irreversibly worse each time. If we as a party do not recognize this dynamic and provide the electorate some sort of vision forward, we will keep losing forever. Because nobody likes Republicans, but we as a party look like we do not understand the assignment.

"Get their base to stop the rhetoric against Republicans.   Be better with the details on hand when addressing or responding to Republican criticism. As in present a specific example in each rhetoric that is specific to that elected rep.  So every time they open their mouth they’re exposing themselves to a mistake they made in their own riding. And do it on X (allow replies but don’t read them, Musk doesn’t, X is for tweeting only nobody cares about the replies.)  Every time Trump makes a statement, point out on X why it does not work for HIS BASE, for Maga, from the Maga perspective.   (The press needs to make it visual, a story for instance on how specific Kentucky families who were laid off from a Liquor plant due to tariffs would actually hit Republicans really hard on national TV).  Republicans respond to individual stories that provide irrefutable proof via camera feeds. So the Democrats need to get in there and start interviewing the people who are directly affected by Trump, who voted for Trump, and who are Maga, or at the very least Republicans.  Drop the contentious issues from policy. If ALL Biden was trying to do was run the economy then he never would have lost the election, but he did a lot more then that.  Drop contentious policy from platforms. You think it’s stupid when the Republicans run with an anti-abortion mandate, and they agree. They hid that and implemented it very nefariously which was permitted by the Democrats at every step of the way!. Why then was Kamila running with DEI policy when it has poor support?  If it’s not supported don’t run with it. Why run with anything that is outside of Government mandates and reduce your chances of election.  It’s not as if the progressive have anyone else to vote for, so cater to the middle.  They need to drop absolute explanations. In Canada inflation was blamed on Covid shipping, and then on CEO’s gouging, but it was primarily driven by immigration.  The gov, like the CEO’s hid behind a Covid excuse to implement policy that created inflation. They lied, by lying they undermined their own voice. Just answer questions like a scientist, nothing is certain everything is apparent. When the right hears something that has no wiggle room their mind literally identifies it as manipulation.  They need to see the good news and the bad news, and they will never believe that there is no bad news, so present it. Don’t hide anything from a Republican, it leads to instant mistrust.  Democrats undermined themselves again when they were found to implement DEi policy (which is partisan) into Government Departments that are legislated to be bipartisan for the specific reason that those departments need to operate across ALL Jurisdictions in the US. They undermined the operation of the departments so that Republicans no longer trust their operations. And look what happened. This all occurred once before, the reason why the law says that those departments need to be bipartisan is to prevent this outcome. So maybe the Dems need to hire a historian to avoid repeating mistakes.   And above all, everything they do needs to be focused on repairing that divide with as many republicans as they can.

In my state it's 200% of the federal poverty level, which for a family of 4 comes in at around $60k/year. Make $61k? Sorry, no benefits even though you literally can't afford to live. There's no where to rent that's less than $2,000/month for a family, and if you buy now with rates and prices what they are, you are going to be paying close to $4000+/month for your mortgage. Not to mention transportation cost, utilities, etc.  Even for a single person, the cutoff for SNAP is $31k/year. That's less than minimum wage. So someone who works full time minimum wage doesn't qualify for any benefits, but also literally can't afford basic needs here. Median rent is $2,026. Someone making $20/hour here full time is going to spend their entire paycheck on rent.   The federal poverty level needs updated, but even better would be to just stop means testing, or put pressure on wages to increase.   To live where I do, and not be paycheck-to-paycheck, a family of 4 effectively needs to make close to $170,000/year.

You better be bringing in at least $200k/year.  *edit* means testing the programs also keeps people in poverty, because you're better off that way.

">Obama actually did deliver much of what he promised. He still got punished for it.  Okay, I love Obama. My time working as '08 campaign staff was amazing, it defined the course of my life, and I'm immensely proud of what we accomplished. But he completely failed to deliver or massively underdelivered on all of his flagship promises.  Pulling us out of wars in the ME? Closing Gitmo? Solving health insurance? High-speed rail? Or his early priority on affordable housing (tbf he had to discard that one very early)? Nope. He became the drone strike president, Gitmo is still in use, he appointed a bloodthirsty Kissinger acolyte as SecState, he let Rahm talk him into bailing out the banks with basically no consequences or oversight, and his health insurance plan was just a reskinned Heritage Foundation/Romneycare project that empowered health insurance companies in exchange for harm reduction and kicked the problem down the road.  We can debate how much is his fault given the highly obstructionist GoP. But that changes blame, not whether he delivered. And as much as I love the guy, he's one of the worst underdeliverers I'm aware of in political history. Though weirdly, he was a better Bush than Bush. Similar to how Clinton was a better Reagan than Reagan in many ways.  >Clinton delivered on most of his promises as well. It’s because he moved to the middle that he was able to do that.  Clinton's an interesting case because so much of what he ran on was separate from his literal promises. He ran heavily on anti-elite populism framed around Reagan's plutocratic predations. But what he actually deployed was in many ways the exact opposite--his form of neoliberalism was Reagnism 2.0, this time with extra sax. So he did what he said he'd do at a policy-level, but the opposite of what so many people supported him for. Though it took a few years for the effects to fully hit, so there was a bit of separation between Clinton's campaign and Clinton's consequences (Reagan benefitted similarly).  Both Clinton and Obama ran on change platforms. It's basically impossible for a change platform to actually deliver, and I think every politically savvy person knew it even then. But the whole country is desperately hungry for change and has been for decades--to the point that the more anti-establishment, change-focused candidate has won every election since the 1980s.  Really goes to show that you've always had to sell a big vision if you want to attract voters that don't follow things at a detailed policy level.

It does not matter if they are college educated or a high school dropout. It does not matter if they’re making a 6-figure salary working as an engineer for, say, Lockheed Martin or some schmuck working at McDonald’s as the janitor. Every single one of these people are equally exploited and taken advantage of. Even if you’re making more money, you’re in a position where your contributions toward a company and accumulation of returns vastly outweighs whatever you’re being paid, and therefore, you are exploited.

"That precise situation is why I'm so incredulous about the idea that Democrats are just controlled opposition and they don't really want these policies. Yeah sure, some of them don't, but the truth is that the Democrats have rarely had the numbers to implement these ideas in the first place. Over the last ***30 years*** Democrats only controlled the White House and Congress (Edit:) at the same time for ***four years***. Of course they can't get anything done!  There's been no sustained continuity of leadership by the Democratic party. No opportunity to build on anything. Every time they take office they're busy undoing the damage that the Republicans had just done.  Too many people ignore the realities of our political system. People don't elect enough Democrats to get anything done and then blame the Democrats for getting nothing done. It's a vicious cycle. Instead of seeing these as obstacles that we still need to overcome, they classify it as ""excuses"" while ignoring the massive impacts of things like the filibuster and the spoiler effect.  Democrats only had a super majority for a matter of days and they put all of that effort into passing the ACA, but apparently they should have also codified Roe v. Wade and done a dozen other things in that time too.  More recently people saw a 50/50 split in the Senate with Harris as a potential tie breaking vote and took that to mean that we had an opportunity to revolutionize our country towards progressive ideas. 26 of her 33 tie breaking votes were just to build their cabinet through nomination votes.  Moreover, two of those 50 Democrats aren't even Democrats anymore. People look at the Democratic party as a monolith as if they're like the Republican party, but the Democratic party is very much a big tent party covering a wide range of ideologies.  When you have Senators in your 50/50 tie who ended up leaving the Democratic party you can't claim that as a win much less a missed opportunity! The opportunity was never there and it was just wishful thinking to think it was going to provide anything meaningful. Then the voters turned the knife by giving the Republicans the House to years later.  In order to get enough Democrats who do support progressive policies, they need much larger numbers in elected office to account for the blue dogs and moderates.

"This completely ignores the perception that demonstratably exists that Republicans are good for the economy. Yes, in reality, they tend to be terrible and fairly reliably give us a recession in short order, but there is in fact the perception among the American populace that they are traditionally a safe bet for the economy. This is in part due to decades of propagandandizing against anything left-of-Reagan, and partly because they have convinced many people that when the corporations do well everyone does well.  I won't dispute that racism and entitlement and a general lack of empathy stemming from a rampant individualistic ""screw you I've got mine"" mentality among white Americans certainly plays a role, but you are ignoring a lot of other factors here in an era where a lot of things do simply boil down to fear over economic uncertainty.

Those are meaningless concepts for the share of the electorate we're actually competing over. Pro vs anti establishment is a far more relevant axis--both in history and especially now, after Reagan created a new economic status quo that's utterly devastating for most Americans. That's messaging everyone can understand, while the political-triangulation approach is basically designed by people with Polisci degrees who only ever interact with other hyperpolitical types.  Regular folk *hate* this new economy. But we Dems have positioned ourselves as the defenders of the status quo. Clinton and Obama both ran on economic change platforms harnessing this discontent and they were wildly successful. But they both governed like Reagan-lites, so the core discontent never actually went away. Republicans make the status quo drastically worse whenever they're elected, while Dems steward a slower continued decline with harm-reduction policies that only undo a fraction of the damage.  Our party has spent decades essentially operating off a bogus definition of what's ""safe"". When under pressure, we keep trying to make ourselves as inoffensive as possible. We retreat to institutions, we avoid any meaningful change messages, we shift towards a meaningless center in the delusion that actually matters for the voters we're trying to win, and we double down on every mistake that got us here.

">The data shows that Black women didn't vote for Trump. And many Hispanics are white. Your perspective just doesn't match the data.  Uh, opposite actually. Your economic & political perspectives are diametrically opposed to all the data trends we've been seeing. You're also conflating a lot of very different points and just taking all kinds of casual assumptions as fact. Like this bit right here--perfect example. Your assumption was that anger = white (male implied) racism. My response is that many nonwhite people (including many women) are *furious* about the exact same root causes, but that anger is very easy to manipulate using racism with economically dissatisfied white people. And your rebuttal was...that can't be true because non-white women didn't vote for Trump and Hispanics are white?  Do you see the problems with that back and forth? Because that's a deeply dysfunctional logic chain that you're presenting as gospel without doing any of the work to establish it as true or relevant. And I'm going to be honest, that logic tangle feels a bit representative of our communications.  I strongly believe that Reagan triggered an eventual economic collapse where people who got sufficiently ahead during the better times have been able to stay ahead. This problem was exacerbated with each modern economic crisis--each time, the wealthy took the opportunity to further restructure America into a plutocracy treadmill.  Those of us who didn't build up speed in time have to work several times as hard to keep up. So basically young people (not from extraordinarily wealthy households) and people who weren't well off before each crash are extremely disadvantaged. While people who got cozy *before* the financial earthquakes separated the classes are essentially living in a parallel dimension.  So many of your comments seem to completely misunderstand what my complaints even are. In my experience, this is very typical of older people who got theirs in time and are now completely incapable of understanding why people hate the 21st century economy--thus the incomprehension why people are angry and the ""I don't know, must be racism"" response. Unfortunately, our party leadership & strategists are overwhelmingly older generations who outraced this economic collapse and are sitting pretty with absolutely no idea that people are mad. The result is that our party has been completely unable to compete in the 21st century--our only real success was Obama, who acknowledged that dissatisfaction and ran a change platform *against* the party.",Sminahin,2025-04-24T11:35:42,8
