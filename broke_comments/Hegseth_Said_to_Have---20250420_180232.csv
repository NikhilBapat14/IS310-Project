Can we get him resigned please. Also presidents should not be allowed to create their own cabinet anymore. Especially if they are going to pick unqualified morons for every position. Leave it to the house and senate to nominate candidates qualified for each position and then vote on them.,ChangingmynametoJT,2025-04-20T19:43:15,5
And not a goddamn peep from the Democrats.   Flip the script. The GOP would be screaming bloody murder (and rightfully so) 24/7. Democrats? Lol. Don‚Äôt even fucking get me started.   This is on *us.* The only people we can depend on and trust is us. Fill the streets. Go on strike. Shut this goddamn shithole of a country down. That‚Äôs the only way you will *ever* effect change in a fascist regime.,HaxanWriter,2025-04-20T19:36:39,6

Maybe she needed text verification so that she could sell the info on to her Chinese/Russian/Saudi bosses?  Aren‚Äôt all of them openly paid by foreign powers to gut this country?  MAGA = Morons Are Gutting America.,mbw70,2025-04-20T18:27:13,12
"Anti-Trump protests are growing nationwide.  It's never going to be fast enough until it stimulates real change which will happen.  Keep in mind, the United States isn't exactly familiar with a dictatorship and how one can be expected to react.  This is on MAGA.  This is on a group of Republicans in power that would rather have a cult than a constituency.  This is on Republican leaders that are too weak to tell the truth.  This is on *those* cowards.",OS2_Warp_Activated,2025-04-21T04:58:56,3
