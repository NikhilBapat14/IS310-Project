"State law requires the flag in every classroom yet this kid is suspended for pointing out the school breaking this law. With the Garcia business, the school board being sued in SCOTUS for forcing 3 year olds to read LGBT propaganda, and now this what the hell else is going on in Maryland? They seem as dysfunctional as California.",social_dinosaur,2025-04-24T08:01:52,99
>The five officers who responded to the scene apparently told Jensen he needed to be a credentialed journalist to record in the school board's building.  Looks like conspiracy to violate civil rights under color of law.,goat-head-man,2025-04-24T07:15:57,67
Seriously? Suspension? Schools are run by liberal totalitarians and supported and endorsed and protected by the teachers union.,Lifeisagreatteacher,2025-04-24T07:42:04,33

"Shame on the Maryland County School system, instead they send Van Hollen to retrieve an MS 13 gang member.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-24T06:17:34,37
"The problem is that unless there are real *punitive* consequences, the school district has nothing to lose.  If they can simply get away with an, ""Oops! Our bad,"" then nothing will change and they will still have effectively won.  This is why these things keep happening in spite of the fact that they inevitably lose when challenged.",Celebril63,2025-04-24T11:04:17,10
"My nephew was a fairly liberal teacher in Montgomery County Maryland ,now he loves president Trump, and has made the  switch to Common Sense conservative. Students don't have to even go to class they can't fail them they can't do anything, he's like we're not even teaching these kids anything. Maryland sucks as a state",Icu611,2025-04-24T14:56:25,3
Just another example (of many) demonstrating that the democrat party is a foreign controlled domestic terrorist organization masquerading as a political party to bring down America.,vampirepomeranian,2025-04-24T11:52:07,7
"Maryland I made insane by the overflow of crazies from DC. Their policies made DC expensive and uninhabitable beyond a few decent areas, so they fled to Maryland and now Northern Virginia for better lives and lower costs of living, but now their policies are catching up to them there too. Virginia has actually started to fight back at least, but you still see a lot of crazy headlines coming out of places like Loudoun County, a DC suburb and one of the richest counties on the US by average household income.",Mountain_Man_88,2025-04-24T08:48:08,29
Because ms-13 are democrat voters. This young man isn‚Äôt.,dottedoctet,2025-04-24T09:19:01,19
"Too bad this kid is in MD-2 rather than MD-1. Andy Harris would stand up for this kid. Johnny Olszewski won‚Äôt.   And being as he‚Äôs in Towson, he doesn‚Äôt have any help in Annapolis either (well, except maybe at the Naval Academy, but that doesn‚Äôt do him any good since he‚Äôs enlisted and not ROTC/OCS/Academy).",FlyJunior172,2025-04-24T17:48:01,3
"Maryland has Wes Moore for governor and Virginia has Youngkin, so the differences start there. Still a ton of swamp creatures in NVA living in their multimillion dollar gated communities but the rest of the state is relatively sane. Maryland is just a basket case.",social_dinosaur,2025-04-24T09:19:32,9
"Yup, that too!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-24T09:40:16,5
Virginia was getting bad and elected Youngkin to stop it.,Mountain_Man_88,2025-04-24T09:25:45,11
