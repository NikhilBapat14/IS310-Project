My brother is brainwashed. He threw a violent tantrum at a family event and scooped up his crying young children to run away while screaming at our mother because she called Matt Gaetz a pedophile.

"I think QAnon and similar phenomena represent a relatively new type of cult that exists primarily in digital spaces.

"Those people are simply fucked. And there's really no way to de-redicalize them. The spigot of hatred and lies will never get shut down. And invariably, their mental disease will return in full bloom in another generation or so.   My oldest brother fell under their spell, and I almost lost him because of that. He ended up coming to the realization that the people who he was listening to weren't just full of shit, they were as close to the embodiment of evil as it gets.   Sadly, that happened as he was dying of multiple myeloma - but he shook his head close to the end and told me he was so embarrassed about being hoodwinked.   Lost my best friend of forty years to the new Nazi movement. To this day I hear he asks if I'm still mad about him being a MAGA member. I was never mad. Just sad. Cut off all content when he started talking crap about ""the gays"" without realizing that my daughter was one of the people he now hated.   These people are simply lost. Nothing short of absolute catastrophe has a chance of changing them - and most of them would simply shrug that off as another part of the epic conspiracy against them.",Fluid_Anywhere_7015,2025-04-22T17:58:14,7

"So i think the strategy now that trump is really going off the rails, and his policies will surely start to effect them, is to never mention any of it again. There are a couple reasons for this:  - the type of person that is a full-blown Trumper is a contentious personality - its cool because it's against the grain. They love it because everyone always hates on it and 'everyone else is stupid and I'm smart. Once it's no longer contentious, they can start to ease up instead of doubling down.  - I used to work in republican politics and for the libertarian party (just saying that now makes me want to throw up). I watched both go so far right in the last 10 years and still know plenty of people in that world. The libertarian party, who has been just as bad as maga and somewhat a part of maga, has recently started calling trump Hitler for his due process and civil liberty violations. They are very mad that he is going out of his way to defy the Supreme Court. I've never seen so much push back of trump in that community. I also am starting to see alot of the ""true believers"" start to call trump an idiot and a fraud. The reasons for them calling him that are hilarious but it's very encouraging. Circling back to the point, if we allow them to convince eachother without injecting ourselves in the situation, i think we may actually turn the corner.",niltermini,2025-04-22T14:30:21,9
"I’m sorry you’re hurting over this. I lost my family too and am completely alone, genetically. But I have built a family of true friends and relationships. These folks would die for me and I would die for them. I’m in their wills, they are in mine.   What you’re mourning is the loss of what was never really there, and that realization is what hurts the most. You had an image in your head of what and who they were and how they felt about you - only to realize that it was all in your head.   I hope the hurt lessens, internet stranger, as time goes on. I hope you are able to cultivate your own family. It takes time, but anything worthwhile does. Blood is just that - blood. Nothing more, nothing less.
