Sure let’s see how this plays out. They are going to write a report and say some choice words without any actual consequences and our rapist king diaper is going to act like a victim again. I just tldr the next 4 days we can skip the bullshit now. ,walrus_breath,2025-04-21T23:00:31,22

"Excellent opinion piece, well worth reading. (See brief excerpt below.)  ""The Justices, most of them, must now understand: we are not dealing with an Administration that deserves the benefit of the doubt. And so, when A.C.L.U. lawyers raced to the high court with an emergency petition indicating that another group of Venezuelan migrants was receiving the scantiest semblance of due process—notices of removal in English only, with no information about how to contest designations as “enemy aliens” and no suggestion that there was any opportunity for judicial review—their pleas had new resonance. The ensuing 1 A.M. order represented the Administration reaping the results of its own bad-faith arguments and behavior with the Court.""",Nerd-19958,2025-04-21T23:34:56,9

The nightmare that this court created now has to deal with this monster and so far has chosen to back Trump instead of the constitution. This court is the biggest threat to the constitution that we have ever seen.,will2828,2025-04-22T13:03:43,1

"The supreme court has already said anything in his official remit can’t be illegal when he is executing these obligations.  Therefore, obstruction etc might be illegal for the administration to do, but not for Trump himself to try and get away with. Where does his administration start and Trump himself end?

"No government is as strong as we are made to think it is. Look how much Russia is struggling with Ukraine or how much Israel is struggling to fully commit genocide. If any country had the power they claim to have Russia would’ve crushed Ukraine in a week, Israel would have killed all the Palestinians in the world, and America wouldn’t be in an economic free-fall from the tariffs because we are supposedly so big and bad nobody would ever attack us",NamelessGlass,2025-04-22T10:41:24,1

"Self interest. The same thing happens periodically with Republicans in Congress. Suppose they go along with everything he does and he establishes a de facto dictatorship. What exactly is their value to him in that scenario? Why should anyone bribe them, or accommodate them in any way? Why shouldn't Trump replace them by people without any intelligence or political experience, so that there's even less of an incentive to act independently?  In short: they want to be henchmen rather than lackeys, so from time to time they feel the need to pretend to go against him, usually when they see that their own power base is being eroded. It's the contradiction inherent in their position, really: they made him into a king but never realized that this ""success"" has effectively ended their usefulness to him.  The reality is that they will lose out. The only people who will gain power in the scenario they have set up is the clique of people with personal connections to Trump, the ""favorites"" of his court who derive that power by their ability to act as fixers. They will serve as a bridge between the delusional world within and the real world outside, feuding for the favour of their boss on the inside by enacting his dictates (no matter how stupid) and taking bribes from those who want to influence him on the outside.  These judges and Republican representatives are on the outside like everyone else. They have political power because they represent an institution, and that no longer matters in a world were power is derived solely from the person sitting at the top. They made themselves expendable.",barryvm,2025-04-22T02:30:19,4

They need to revisit that ruling somehow. If they don't he's virtually untouchable even if he ignores everything they say and he can just pardon anyone they try to hold accountable in his administration.  And next time maybe think before making a ruling like this. I know it's asking a lot.,-CJF-,2025-04-22T03:52:44,18

But the removal will result in him being prosecuted again because he’s no longer president.
