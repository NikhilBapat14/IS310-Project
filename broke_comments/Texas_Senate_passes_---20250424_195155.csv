"I gotta ask. What is going on in bathrooms in red states? I get in, do my business and wash my hands and leave. There could be a 300 pound purple elephant dancing in the corner and I probably wouldn’t notice. Much less care.",nopulsehere,2025-04-24T20:09:13,1

Dumb and pointless.  What we need is a law that requires businesses and public areas to remove urinals and add stalls if they switch to gender neutral bathrooms.  There's nothing more uncomfortable than some lady having a peak at my dong while I'm using a urinal.,Embarrassed-Pride776,2025-04-24T20:11:08,1

"The typical conservative mindset is ""I am normal, therefor everyone is like me. Everyone thinks and acts like me. Any deviation from me is just a delusional liar. So trans people must be doing what I would do if I put on a dress. Use it to sneak in and rape people. It's the only Logical reason.""   It's the opposite of empathy. Projecting yourself onto others so you can dismiss their struggles as laziness or insanity.",Nekowulf,2025-04-24T20:55:51,1

"""Working as intended"".  Trans misogyny hurts all women.  Irony being, more cis women will experience trans phobia than trans women as their are simply not that many of us (.004% in some cases).",Chaoslab,2025-04-24T20:22:12,1
"Objectively, they are going to attack more cis women with this.  But they don't care. The point is cruelty.",Professional-Buy2970,2025-04-24T20:06:34,1
They dont care about trans men that much. They barely acknowledge that trans men even exists. It's the trans women they want disappeared. The bulk of their hatred and anger is directed towards any cis-man or any person assigned male at birth who doesn't conform to the stereotypes and expectations of that male gender assignment. There is no flexibility. They view non-conformity as a threat to society.,InsideAside885,2025-04-24T20:40:37,1
