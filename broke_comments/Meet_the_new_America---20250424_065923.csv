"Live in Indiana which is rolling back rights and access on a daily basis. We’re in a blue city but still actively planning to move to the more modern and welcoming Michigan. There are many people (employed, educated, skilled labor) who are doing the same, heading to Michigan or Illinois (Chicago area for most of the 20 somethings). The brain drain is real.  Our governor/chief idiot, Mike Braun is the worst one ever (that says a lot considering Mike Pence was a recent one) and our legislature is full of white male Christofascists. I will say it’s hilarious watching all the dipshits I rural areas come to terms with the fact all their entitlements are going away.",MayorCharlesCoulon,2025-04-24T07:12:19,26
"It's time to ban these foreign, pro-genocide and pro-dehumanization lobbies from having influence on American elections because these lobbies spending a lot of money on American elections and politics are not in many peoples interests.",postsshortcomments,2025-04-24T07:54:14,11

"When I got to ""Amanda McPhillips Quit California for New York to escape the fires"" I could only shake my head.  1. California is a huge area, only small portions have been affected by wildfires.  I live in San Diego and it's as safe as anywhere in the US.  2. NY has wildfires - as does every other state.  The inclusion of this histrionic over-reaction weakens the entire article.",nogooduse,2025-04-24T14:41:08,1
"Michigan really isn’t more modern or welcoming, so I would be careful. Our state government had a blue wave in 22 but since then went to trump in 2024, as well as flipping the house of reps back to republicans. Current House leadership is as trumpian as they come, and Gov Whitmer is about to be termed out. Senate elections in 2026 will be the deciding factor in whether our “thin blue line” will hold, otherwise you can expect the GOP revenge tour to be in full swing here just like what is currently happening the federal government.",dogmotherhood,2025-04-24T09:15:12,2
"Yes, lobbying is by definition corruption.  It’s supplants the interests of the majority by special interests and it drives corruption.",PlanetCosmoX,2025-04-24T08:03:58,3

"I also left California due to the fires.   I was sick of smoke all fall, and know multiple people who lost everything in Paradise. My cousins in Napa have had to evacuate without warning because the hill behind their house was on fire two separate times. The couple I used to babysit for had their house dropped from their insurance company and can’t find a buyer for it. Palisades and Malibu were massive and in urban areas.   You feeling safe in SD doesn’t mean it’s an overreaction for others to leave the state.",Suspicious_Lynx3066,2025-04-24T19:41:03,1
"You have this foreign dark money pouring into our country and aiding the worst of the worst domestic groups encouraging, promoting, and teaching these viewpoints of their very terrible countries and wanting to teach these values to our children and blanket our country with their PAC ads and values.",postsshortcomments,2025-04-24T08:06:19,5

"Yes the only application of cryptocurrency is to corrupt, and steal.  Biden should have banned it.  Trump is going to try and put all US currency in it, so that it can be stolen.   This is the tool that is being used against the US to undermine it. There are no good applications to cryptocurrency. That money is going to Russia,  North Korea, Iran, and terrorists. The more money people put into crypto, the more money those bad actors have to destabilize and destroy the US, and fund themselves.",PlanetCosmoX,2025-04-24T08:30:54,5
