Pretty sure even non-US citizen true criminals on US soil are afforded due process rights. That's the whole point.,dangersson,2025-04-20T13:33:07,22
"Even if this is exactly how his tats look, what the hell does that have to do with his right to due process? I just can’t believe we are here. What is his point? This is the party of law and order? I think not.",Sioux-me,2025-04-20T13:18:50,17

"The 'MS 13"" is just photoshopped on his hand to show what each tattoo means. I'm sure that no one is trying to say that those letters 'MS 13"" are the tattoo itself. Even so, a pot leaf, a smilely face, a cross and a skull are NOT used by gang members of MS-13.",jadiana,2025-04-20T13:16:58,17
"Sorry but this is the dumbest sort of outrage. The MS13 on the image are clearly supposed to be labels for the ""interpretations"" of the actual tattoos on his fingers. The interpretations are ridiculous, of course, and having tattoos isn't illegal and due process should still be served. But I seriously don't think that they are trying to pass off the perfect Arial font that's super-imposed on the picture as his tattoos. This feels like a terrible distraction to what is actually going on: people being captured and deported to a foreign detention center without due process.",No-Proof-7576,2025-04-20T10:06:44,29

"none of us know the context of those tattoos if they are even real. We know what they told us is that his family business was threatened by the gang and that they were going to take his brother and him into the gang, and that is the reason why they fled. So far there is no criminal record in El Salvador or the United States for him..",3i1bo3aggins,2025-04-20T13:18:35,10
Just another sharpie gate! Also no one gets a knuckle tat above another knuckle tat. I mean they didn’t even bother to use another font than just plain letters. What a bunch of shitbirds!,Tricky-Spread189,2025-04-20T16:01:55,10

If Garcia is ms13 tell a court.,lovely_orchid_,2025-04-20T10:23:46,7
The letters and numbers were just to show what they think the tattoos on the knuckles mean.  I don’t think they meant to make people think he literally had MS13 tattooed on his hand.,rock-n-white-hat,2025-04-20T15:51:33,16
"Ya gotta love how they’ve been saying for DAYS that he has no ties to MS-13, and then we are suppose to believe that these tattoos are real and all of the people dealing with his earlier case, just NEVER NOTICED?!",jencbowles,2025-04-20T19:33:36,3
"Of course it was Photoshop. They admitted they made a mistake. Then, when a federal judge made a ruling, the administration stated they only had to facilitate his return not actually make a concerted effort to bring him back. When they were questioned about those statements, all of a sudden they came out saying he did have gang affiliations and tattoos, and mysteriously came up with a photo that you think they would’ve shown from the very start. Of course it was fake.",Zen-platypus,2025-04-20T22:25:38,4
"I think the original intent of the photo was for MS13 to be a legend explaining the tattoos (which, by the way, no one has been able to confirm that tattoo's have anything to do with MS13).  But I think President sharpie is too dumb to understand that the MS13 was not part of the tattoo.  Because he is very stupid",AdAccomplished6870,2025-04-21T17:00:08,4

Don’t give him too much credit. Don’t forget he drew on a map with a sharpie because he wouldn’t admit he made a mistake,KeeblerElff,2025-04-20T13:27:32,7
"That's my take as well. I think our side looks a little silly taking the ""Photoshop"" angle.   This article is a pretty good analysis. It starts off on the Photoshop angle but debunks both that and the alleged interpretation of the tatts.   https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-posts-image-kilmar-abrego-175852020.html    >The interpretation of those symbols is not so cut-and-dried, however. The four symbols – “Marijuana,” “Smiley,” “Cross” and “Skull” – have not been found in any law enforcement guidelines or manuals to stand in for MS-13 gang identification.",def_indiff,2025-04-20T11:09:27,11
That's what I thought too but trump was pretty ambiguous about it in his post. He's not very good with words but he did say that he had ms13 tattoed on him. But it's whatever ig,WillyDAFISH,2025-04-20T10:47:19,4
My guess is that staff made up the picture and explained to him that the alpha numeric labels corresponded to the tats.  He retained a fraction of what they said or changed it on the fly cause it sounded better in his huge good brain,blockholeforever,2025-04-20T11:41:09,2
"Frankly, given the timeline of him coming to the country, even if he *was* affiliated with MS-13 when he came here fleeing gang violence, that affiliation would be irrelevant *now*. He came here at 16 and has no criminal record since coming here. Claiming a 29 year old needs to be brutalized because of tattoos from when they were a teenager is absurd.",Voltage_Z,2025-04-20T11:37:51,10
How many people out there sporting tattoos that they got when they were out runnin and gunnin but have since changed their lives.  I’ve been hanging out with people who have completely changed their lives for 21 years now so I’m big on redemption.  People change so a tattoo in and of itself is not a clear indication of who a person is right now.,Christ_on_a_Crakker,2025-04-20T12:22:32,7

They literally said he has MS 13 tattooed.  Not that he had symbols they interpret to being MS 13.  The ambiguity was intentional and 90% of MAGA already want to believe it and take it literally.     They weren’t trying to convince a court — doctoring evidence would be a crime.  It was them justifying themselves to their base.  Fox News has already blurred the line between proof of a fact and political argument to the point that MAGA can’t tell the difference.,Hener001,2025-04-21T03:26:31,4
