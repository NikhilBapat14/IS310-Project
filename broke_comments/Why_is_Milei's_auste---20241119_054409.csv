"Any policy can be considered a success if you choose a criteria that lines up with your pre-stated goals and ignore other indicators, as the author of the second link does. Lowering inflation is not the only metric, but if you focus on that, you will spike other key metrics-in Argentina's case, that's the rate of poverty is at 53%, up from around a consistent 40% for the last several years.  [https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mileis-austerity-seen-pushing-half-argentina-into-poverty-2024-09-26/](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mileis-austerity-seen-pushing-half-argentina-into-poverty-2024-09-26/)  This is kind of the same trap we just experienced here in the US-official data said inflation is cooling off, but realworld experience is a much different thing.   If your goal is to make a car weigh less, you can remove the tires and the engine. You will be successful in lowering it's weight. But by all other metrics, the car will perform worse.",scubafork,2024-11-20T12:05:25,15
"Given my own political leanings, I've been following Argentina fairly closely.  [There are some deep studies](https://www.bbvaresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Argentina-Economic-Outlook_3Q24.pdf) and it'll end up being a true test of austerity approaches.  If you look at slide 18, for example, the people *very much* wanted inflation addressed - it was over 60%.  I think a better analogy is that people wanted the engine to stop smoking so they put in a new, cheaper oil that's causing it to not run as well.",AuditorTux,2024-11-20T12:57:38,4
"The problem was inflation that was what miley ran on.Â  So yes, if you run on something and you manage to reduce it, you can claim a victory. Miley admitted that poverty was going to increase that things were gonna get worse before they got better.You just don't like the fact that he succeeded",Terrible_Year_954,2025-01-08T17:54:01,1
"That same slide kinda proves the opposite point to me. People wanted inflation addressed, but now that inflation is not the top issue, they care about unemployment.",scubafork,2024-11-20T13:10:42,2
"Its no longer the top issue because it went from 25% in December of 2023 (the month he took office).  Other measures put it [*much, much* higher than that](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.DEFL.KD.ZG?locations=AR) (but its also different measurements of inflation, so they're all more or less saying the same thing).  If its truly down to 4% (original source) from 12% before that bad month, and it holds there, austerity measures he's doing probably can't do much more.  But its more or less handled and so they need to move on to other topics.  And if that GDP projection pans out, they might well be on their way to starting to deal with the rest of it.",AuditorTux,2024-11-20T14:44:49,3
