"No country spends more per capita on health care per citizen than the USA, at over $12,000 per citizen. Switzerland is second, at $8,000 per. The problems are significantly more obvious than, “We need to spend more on health care.”",sunkenship13,2025-04-15T08:46:02,109

"Our Medicaid. Gosh, I wish government would stop subsidizing everything on planet earth. ",Reuters-no-bias-lol,2025-04-15T05:45:35,15
"I love the healthcare discussion, because it's so mind-numbingly stupid. No one else should be subsidizing your medical care.",squunkyumas,2025-04-15T05:50:01,-37
"Corruption is wide and deep in healthcare.  Med schools limit the number of Docs they graduate, and work with States as the State determines how many Docs they can graduate, this is to keep Doc salary high.  Same with Hospital beds, states and/or municipalities determine how many hospital and nursing home beds in an area - this keeps demand high compared to supply - which a high schooler knows raises prices.    Then we have drugs and medical equipment, with the FDA, big Pharma, big medical equipment companies revolving door.  Joe Smith is a high up in the FDA. Joe “helps” ACME Big Pharma Inc get a few drugs through the system over his 30yr tenure.  After decades of “wink, wink - nudge, nudge” from ACME, when Joe “retires” he lands a fat “consulting” gig at ACME Inc., $600,000/yr, a company car, company health insurance, a phone that only goes to Voice Mail, and an email inbox Joe only uses to do stuff like ask HR how to change his payroll direct deposit.  Because Joe doesn’t actually do any work, it’s delayed bribery.    And the cluster fuck if Medicare and the red tape bullshit providers must go through for Medicare and any health insurance.  If a provider wants to take Medicare they must do a ton of stuff that’s not really related.  It’s a crap ton of red tape. A doc visit for a simple wellness check costs more in processing and administration than it does actual Doc time…",cliffotn,2025-04-15T14:43:56,33

Get congress off of their healthcare program and have them use what we have. It will get fixed in days. ,Blahblahnownow,2025-04-15T11:27:53,27
I really can't get behind this. What should poor/disabled people do? Die? The government should provide basic services for those who are unable to provide for themselves.,craytsu,2025-04-15T08:49:12,83
