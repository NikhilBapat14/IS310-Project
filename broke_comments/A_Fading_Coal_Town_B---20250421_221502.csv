"They get what they pay for.... Should have thought harder b4 voting...  Somerset: Trump 5,614 (51.3%), Harris 5,175 (47.3%)",netsheriff,2025-04-21T22:37:09,19
"Non paywalled gift link. Excerpt:  > SOMERSET, Mass.—Pat Haddad fought for years to keep open a hulking coal-fired power plant in this bayside town of 18,000. After the facility closed in 2017, the locally dubbed “Queen of Coal” transformed into the “Witch of Wind.”  > Staring down a hole in Somerset’s economy, the state representative and others bet big on the offshore wind industry as a way out. A planned factory on the site of the old plant would build underwater cables funneling energy onshore from skyscraper-size wind turbines off the coast. President Joe Biden even visited in 2022, casting the $200 million project as a symbol of America’s clean-energy revolution.   > But these days the property stands empty, patrolled by deer and wild turkey—a sign of a dream deferred.   > The election of President Trump, who has railed against wind power and promised to kill new projects, hammered what many in Somerset believe was the final nail in the coffin for the proposal, which already was facing shaky demand and permitting delays. The Italian company behind the project pulled out days before his inauguration.",nosotros_road_sodium,2025-04-21T22:15:19,10
"I guess there's not enough money to pocket with wind. To hell with the environment, how much money can be made? Coal emits more carbon than any other fossil fuel and causes severe health problems for miners and people who breathe polluted air. Our planet will never recover from what Trump is doing.",invalidpassword,2025-04-21T22:39:24,2

"Whenever I’m not feeling well and still want to do something creative I pick a theme and assemble song lyrics from stupid Trump quotes.    “Windmills” was one of the easiest themes so far, due to having long, rambling statements full of absolute wackiness.  This is a man who has expressed a lot of *weird* opinions about wind power.      I guess we shouldn’t be surprised anymore that people haven’t been paying attention for the past decade.  ",Nopey-Wan_Ken-Nopey,2025-04-22T13:03:39,1
