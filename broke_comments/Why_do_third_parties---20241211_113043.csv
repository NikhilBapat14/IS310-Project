"It’s the mechanics of any system set up like ours. Look up Duverger’s Law; it’s the principle that in systems like the US (single party districts, first past the post) two-party systems emerge. Proportional representation systems lead to more minor parties.  I think your teacher would be happy to learn about how you’ve seen the bigger picture of political systems like these playing out across the world (grounded in longstanding theory from political science), rather than trying to make some special-case view into our parties.

"[Duverger’s Law](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law) is an example of [Game Theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory) in action, and is more rigid in the U.S. compared to other countries that use [first past the post voting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting) due to our presidential (rather than parliamentary) system.      People typically vote for the candidate who strikes a balance of being most closely aligned with their priorities and having a realistic chance of winning. This naturally results in the top two most consistently successful parties increasingly consolidating power over time as their past victories add weight to the “likely to win” side of the scale.",Mrgoodtrips64,2024-12-11T14:59:22,8
"The devil is often in the details but the long and short of it is the DNC and RNC have colluded to make sure that the electoral system favors a[ two party duopoly.](https://secondratedemocracy.com/the-two-party-duopoly/)  Since they're in charge of the campaign laws, they place all sorts of formal and informal constraints around individuals and groups in terms of the entry requirements to even get put on a ballot.  But also, on another level, they create a situation where voters and political candidates alike are in a bit of a [prisoner's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma). Things like [first past the post voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting), gerrymandering, voter obstruction laws, the [electoral college](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College), and institutional inertia favor an ""all or nothing"" partisan power structure.  As a voter, the only way you can ensure you get what you want is if you either vote all Democrat or all Republican, depending on your political leanings. And this is deliberate. This dynamic is by design and it ensures the two party duopoly remains intact.  Even the three branch structure of government itself favours the partisan duopoly. The way the US government is structured, POTUS is always the head of their partisan organization, in addition to being the head of state, the head of cabinet agencies, the head of foreign policy, and the head of the armed forces. That's a lot of incumbent authority to place in the hands of one of only two parties every election cycle. Also, any party with a simple majority in Congress wields incredible power over the minority party, since they can simply gridlock any proposed legislation at a procedural and committee level before it even reaches the assembly for consideration.  Even the judicial branch contributes to this, somewhat. Because SCOTUS is not beholden to the other two branches after a Justice is confirmed at the Senate level, anytime a party manages to stuff it with ideologically right or left justices, the court will be a partisan force in favour of one particular ideology or another potentially for decades, even if the popular will has shifted substantially.  Parties also make sure that people within their own ranks can't reasonably deviate from the party line, which further supresses diversity of choice at the ballot box. The candidates you are allowed to choose from were selected by secret committees, beholden to special interests. American voters are only given the choice between two candidates, both of whom have been vetted by society's elites in advance, and so in a way your vote doesn't really matter. Whoever gets in power is generally going to do whatever the plutocracy wants, first and foremost, and then secondly, whatever the partisan institution wants. What voters want is a tertiary consideration at best. And it's within this context that both Democrats and Republicans have worked together to ensure that they're the only parties who will have a meaningful shot at achieving power in US elections.  Parliamentary systems and proportional systems, on the other hand, tend to be multi-party systems and are more politically moderate and reflective of the overall population's will, since they are more closely centered around consensus and compromise. The executive can also be subject to a no confidence vote in these systems, so they have to be more sensitive to what the people around them want. And the judicial branch in a parliamentary system is beholden to the elected government rather than its own partisan whims, irrespective of what the public wishes.  The Founders believed that any government where authority is not derived from the will of the majority is illegitimate. Our system at every level is designed to ensure that a few people get their way, while any deviation from the status quo line is suppressed before it even has a chance to be discussed. Food for thought about what it means to actually live in the ""Land of the Free.""",mr-louzhu,2024-12-11T18:11:51,8
"Veritasium did a great breakdown of the mathematics involved.  Watch the video below, it is 20 minutes well spent.  https://youtu.be/qf7ws2DF-zk?si=wIYZhmApD-35-VIv",RICoder72,2024-12-11T17:32:20,1

It inevitable based on our voting system.  Game theory will always push any first past the post voting system into a defacto two party system.   This video explains the theory as to why very well.    https://youtu.be/s7tWHJfhiyo?si=y2omXTKx0i8PqsAr  If we had a different voting system then it would be possible for there to be more than two viable parties.  But not in first past the post voting.,HighPriestofShiloh,2024-12-12T21:55:02,0
"Systematic and organizational reasons.  Systematic: FPTP others have talked about; primaries are a proxy for popularity for ideas, which helps people realize whether or not their policies can get enough traction  Organizational: third parties in the US are grifts or scams. They’re organized like dogwater. Anyone with a functioning brain could tell you you need to have a ground game and local parties to push your candidacy. Yet somehow these third party grifters run only every 4 years at the presidential level without doing anything in the meantime to build up the party.",DaSemicolon,2024-12-12T21:55:23,1
"Don't we still run into the same problem with other systems? However, instead of being a 2 party system, it becomes a 2 alliance/coalition system. What I tend to see in other countries is that a lot of different parties are able to get elected, but only a few times are able to get the majority by themselves. So they usually have to make coalitions, and what tends to happen is there is a majority coalition and an opposing coalition. And generally what happens is that there tends to be a consistent ""leading"" party for each coalition. Usually this is the biggest party of each coalition since being the biggest gets you the most sway. So we ultimately end up with 2 big parties that are sometime restrained by other parties within their coalition.  But we sort of have that even with the GOP/Dems. The representatives tend to form ""caucuses"" to represent their factions. And ofc there can be infighting between different caucuses in the same way there can be infighting in a coalition.",JustASumoGuy,2024-12-24T15:48:09,1
