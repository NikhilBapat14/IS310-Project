There is zero upside to doing this.  It's not even funny.  He kept catching lightning with the McDonald's stunt and the garbage truck stunt.  This was stupid.,esqadinfinitum,2025-04-24T22:14:10,93
Why tho?,Hot-Syrup-5833,2025-04-24T21:08:20,113
Yeahh that's a no from almost everyone. This is potentially damaging to the future of the Republican Party. I know that it's trolling and people find it funny but Trump needs to consider the future of the party and the Republican candidate's chances in 2028. Because this isn't helping anything or anyone. It's doing the opposite of helping.,kelvarnsen1603,2025-04-24T22:04:55,50
I get the joke and it may be funny if there were no more elections but the midterms will be here soon enough and he's going to need support.   It would be better if he left the trolling to Reddit and get on with governing.,Key-Monk6159,2025-04-24T21:15:30,67

"People crying about how it will affect midterms are kidding themselves. Most voters won't even remember this by then and the only thing they'll care about is how expensive it costs to survive.  Nothing wrong with this anyway. If Trump is able to wrangle everything together that would be necessary to change the Constitution to allow him to run again then let him. He's the most successful president of the last 50, if not 100, years. I'd love another Trump term.",GeorgeWashingfun,2025-04-24T22:24:39,-40

"Of all the things to be thinking about right now, while there are some seriously world changing issues to be concentrating on all at the same time... This is just horrible optically.   Is it just trolling?  Yeah probably. I doubt he has any interest in the futile fight to get his name on the ballot again. Then again, I didn't think he really would declare a trade war on everybody all at once, so what do I know.   But this is just politically dumb.  And it's the kind of thing that will weigh around Republican necks at the midterms.",Trussed_Up,2025-04-24T21:16:11,315

Trump‚Äôs never really been an effective party leader. It should shock no one that he doesn‚Äôt consider how he might be impacting future republican chances.,EliteJassassin101,2025-04-24T21:42:10,188
If JD Vance decides to run in 2028 I fear this would hurt his campaign because the Dems will use stuff like Trump 2028 to ‚Äúprove‚Äù that a JD presidency is just a workaround for Trump to keep power. The trolling needs to stop,-yayday-,2025-04-24T23:37:33,6
"It actually gets the ‚ÄúTrump or bust‚Äù voters more motivated. For whatever reason, Republicans never seem to vote whenever Trump is not on the ballot.",Trondkjo,2025-04-24T23:55:15,1
Chill. It's not even been the first hundred days. This raises money for the RNC war chest and will be long forgotten by mid-terms. But money doesn't fade (although it does get devalued....),deciduousredcoat,2025-04-24T20:35:07,-325
What does it have to do with midterms? If anything it will get the voters that typically never vote but only do when Trump is involved. There are a TON of low propensity voters that only vote for Trump.,Trondkjo,2025-04-24T23:53:56,-1

And UAP disclosure. I want to know more about what the New York Times‚Äô and 60 Minutes‚Äô reported about a tictac shaped craft that flew circles around Commander Fravor‚Äôs Super Hornet. It‚Äôs confirmed by the Pentagon.,thewholetruthis,2025-04-24T21:04:02,77
"From almost everyone? Come on. This reminds me of the chatter that Trump was the only way Republicans could lose in 2024 and how the GOP was ‚Äúdumb‚Äù for making him the nominee again.   For the record, I wouldn‚Äôt want him to run again because he will be too old and I want young blood, but you guys underestimate his popularity. Each election he gets more votes than the last one .",Trondkjo,2025-04-25T00:04:43,1

The only thing I dislike about stuff like this is that I now have to read a bunch of comments from fake conservatives talking about how this is dangerous to democracy lol  We need The_Donald back,MiceTonerAccount,2025-04-24T20:44:25,-109
"If anything, it could help midterms. There‚Äôs a lot of voters out there that only vote when Trump is on the ballot. It would be great to energize Trump voters to actually get out and vote in the midterms.",Trondkjo,2025-04-24T23:51:25,0

"Lol this reminds me of the whole ‚ÄúWe are shooting ourselves in the foot if we nominate Trump! Literally anyone else would beat Biden in 2024!‚Äù The truth is, Trump is the one who gets people who are typically non-voters to actually vote. If he can attach himself to future candidates, then more power to him. Let‚Äôs face it, he is reason the Republicans are no longer the party of Bush, Cheney, Romney, or McCain.",Trondkjo,2025-04-24T23:58:10,-1
I'm just not a fan of playing into the alarmism. It's a useless distraction that makes him look like a clown. That doesn't help push good policy or do anything other than anger the crazies.,JurassicParkFood,2025-04-24T23:56:08,4
