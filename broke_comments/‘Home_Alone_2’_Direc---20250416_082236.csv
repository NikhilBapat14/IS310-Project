"Saw this in another “regular” sub yesterday and to my surprise most of Reddit seemed to agree that this would be a stupid move.  Granted it was a movie sub and not a political one, but it gave me a bit of hope.",Disastrous-Power-699,2025-04-16T08:57:40,215
And yet they still work with Roman Polanski lmao.   Truly shows just how disgustingly petulant democrats are. Just absolute creatures.,Sad-Amoeba3186,2025-04-16T09:24:51,142
This stuff irks me badly. Why can’t you just laugh about it and move on? Bunch of crybabies…,ancienteggfart,2025-04-16T08:29:30,258
Is NBC going to cut him from The Apprentice?,Svenray,2025-04-16T08:58:05,82
This is a little too close to Stalin removing people who later became unfavored from photos.,NotAnotherRedditAcc2,2025-04-16T10:57:23,35
DVDs and Blu Rays never forget.,PartyOfFore,2025-04-16T09:49:31,41
TDS is 100% real. These goobers can't have a single thought without Trump somehow being involved. It's been ten years of non-stop derangement.,JaredUnzipped,2025-04-16T09:26:40,58
"They fail to mention that Trump allowed them to film in the hotel, which he owned at the time, for no monetary payment. What did he ask for in return? A 5 second cameo.",VerusPatriota,2025-04-16T15:30:20,13
Shouldn't he be happy that he directed someone to the Left?,Right_Archivist,2025-04-16T09:04:48,24

If they cut him out I’ll probably never watch home alone again lmao you don’t gotta tell me twice,IndigoSoullllll,2025-04-16T08:45:50,26

That would be like my crazy friend who photoshopped his ex out of all his pictures.,bw2082,2025-04-16T09:04:55,16
These is as stupid as editing out the WT1 and WT2 from New York outdoor shots.,TooHotTea,2025-04-16T11:22:21,1
Where did this “they’ll probably take me out of this country” talking point come from?,plitspidter,2025-04-16T10:56:40,0
"I saw it on r/homealone, and 95% of comments were saying to leave it because it's funny that Kevin met a famous person and didn't even realize it. It's not political at all, and why removes a 5-second clip?",kinghawkeye8238,2025-04-16T10:35:08,148
"And Woody Allen and 100 others. [It's an open secret](https://variety.com/2016/film/news/elijah-wood-pedophilia-hollywood-problem-1201781021/) that should have created a global boycott, but people like their escapism apparently.",ngoni,2025-04-16T20:38:20,11

It's why one should always purchase the physical copy.   Case in point: the DnD episode of Community was one of the funniest.,sowellpatrol,2025-04-16T11:40:44,14
Just picked a combo Blu-ray of 1 and 2 from Amazon via a goodwill seller just because of this comment. Thanks for the reminder I was able to pick both of these up for far cheaper than both of them digitally and then I'm immune to edits pushed via internet.,Blales,2025-04-16T16:59:38,2
"Seconding ten years, for anyone who forgot there has been a continuous wall of incoherent rage ***with exactly one topic*** from the moment the moment the topic entered the primary race in 2015.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-16T10:01:36,19

In fairness to Kevin I don't think Trump was famous among 10 year olds back then.,NotRadTrad05,2025-04-16T12:32:37,36
>why removes a 5-second clip?  Because the fans of r/homealone fail to understand the extent of the director's TDS,sowellpatrol,2025-04-16T11:38:53,57
"It's not just that people like their escapism, it's supply and demand at a base level.  All sorts of young men and women out in the hinterlands that want to be movie stars/rich/famous and are willing to do things to make that happen.  There are many of them, and considerably fewer star making rolls, and even fewer people that control who gets those.  Those people build considerable power and so people in the business cover for them.  Jennifer Lawrence didn't want to go to college in Kentucky and work for some corporation, she wanted to be a STAR.  Sleeping with Harvey Weinstein made that happen.  Unlike some I think she actually has talent, but getting that talent seen might never have happened without taking the shortcut.",TedriccoJones,2025-04-17T07:24:26,1
"AI Bernie - fires CEO and all the VP’s the first day, because “oligarch” means anybody who makes more than Bernie.  Then to prove his views out he hires a team of High School dropouts to run the company.  The first two hours in they offer to sell the company to a fFortune 50 firm, and sell the $20 Billion company (current market value) for $2Bil - two hours after they were hired.",cliffotn,2025-04-16T16:20:05,4
"I remember when the Trump jokes slowly started to take over the monologues on the late night talk shows. Before long, all of their jokes were about Trump. It was (and is) the only thing they can think about. This was a bellwether for things to come.  It's been a decade of derangement and I don't see it ending until they shuffle off this mortal coil.",JaredUnzipped,2025-04-16T10:26:37,12
