"EOs do not carry the weight of the law and do not have any legal effect outside of guiding and binding the internal affairs of the federal government. [They are not a substitute for legislation or statute, and have no effect on anything or anyone outside of the federal government.](https://www.healthlawadvisor.com/a-primer-on-executive-orders-and-a-preview-of-the-road-ahead)  At any rate, no, this language is not necessarily concerning because they *are* technically signed into the law that governs federal agencies (The Federal Register) and whomever may interact with said agencies by way of a government contract or some such thing. But they are not added to the US Code which governs us all.",Oxytokin,2025-02-07T17:13:33,36
"Here's a MoveOn pledge to only buy necessities until Trump stops violating the Constitution and disregarding the Judiciary, among other offenses. You don't have to sign with your real name if you don't want to in case of retaliation. Just pledge not to participate in the U.S. economy until things change.

I would caution that right now how the admin will attempt to enforce the EOs and how state governments respond will determine precedent. All it takes are some ideologically committed judges to make rulings to effectively change how we interpret the letter of the law and the scope of what an EO can actually do. The admin is genuinely pushing the line as much as they can until they hit a wall.,Icy-Acanthaceae-6816,2025-02-10T14:02:23,7
"It seems that many of the EOs issued recently are taking effect immediately and only weeks later being struck down, after the damage has already been done. Is this true or am I imaging things being more dire than they are?",jktstance,2025-03-04T07:30:53,1
Then do none of the boot liquors in Congress realize that he’s totally making them irrelevant by not having any of the stuff go through and actually be voted as a law rather than just something that can be totally removed and reversed in four years by a Democrat president?Or are they all too stupid to notice that?,Magnum-TA,2025-03-06T13:58:50,1
"I would agree; I suppose my comment was more to ameliorate this specific concern about the use of this language in Trump's schedule. Not the broader concern of the ongoing, extreme and unlawful executive overreach.",Oxytokin,2025-02-10T23:17:56,1
"Yeah, that’s what sucks is seeing sovereign states, their cities, counties and districts, and private and nonprofit companies reacting to EO’s as if they were the law of the land.",Blackdalf,2025-02-13T14:52:38,1
"They are fully aware, but the Republican Party is mostly neo-monarchists, authoritarians, and rich people who do not need to bother themselves with silly things like the law and democracy, so they don't care. In Trump's first term McConnell was often quoted saying things like ""we won't pass anything the president won't sign."" That is NOT how it's supposed to work at all. Congress passes bills, the President can then veto them, and Congress can try to override the veto. This idea that Congress must only pass bills they know the president will sign is positively asinine, and was at the time the clearest indicator that the Republican Party wanted the Congress to become like those legislatures found in Russia, China, Belarus, etc: a rubber stamp giving the appearance of democratic legitimacy to a dictator.  But yes, there are also many, many intelligence-deficient people (placating the bot), but that's mostly in the base. Most politicians are smart enough to know how to take advantage of the intelligence-deficient, and here we are.",Oxytokin,2025-03-07T17:08:59,1
