In other words...rig it so that the GOP always wins no matter how awful they are.,Competitive-Bike-277,2025-04-24T10:06:02,34
"> The March 25 order directs the commission to update the national voter registration form to include a proof-of-citizenship requirement, revise guidelines for voting systems and withhold federal money from any state that continues to accept ballots after Election Day.    That's more than enough voter suppression to guarantee GOP wins.    And mark my words, ICE agents will be stationed at polling locations to intimidate voters.",Searchlights,2025-04-24T10:09:05,28
These election officials need to tell Trump to get fucked; the president doesn't get to tell states how they run their elections.,Cat_herder_81,2025-04-24T10:11:59,20

"As the article notes, this EO is being challenged in court: > Voting rights groups, the Democratic Party and Democratic officials in 21 states have sued, arguing that the Republican president is exceeding his authority under the Constitution and interfering with states’ power to set election rules. They want to block the commission from taking action to implement the executive order.",aleph32,2025-04-24T11:22:50,10
How did that disabled person apply for benefits? Has the elderly person you referred to forgone SS or Medicare? Have they moved (renter) or refinanced (home owner) ever? Have they ever had a prescription for a controlled substance?,RedditReader4031,2025-04-24T13:51:43,1
"Despite the lies about the 2020 election, where is the harm in making elections super secure? Ensure that no one can have any doubts about ballots being cast. You cannot turn around in this country without having to prove your identity. To use town parks. To rent an apartment or close on a house. To go to the doctor. To apply for a job. And in that case, also provide your social security card and at least one utility bill along with submitting to a drug test. At a police roadblock. To use a bank or draw a money order. To rent a storage unit. To buy or rent a car. Regarding identification requirements, I have an honest question for those who’d say they discriminate. How do those you are “looking out” for manage to function? How have they completely removed themselves from modern life?",RedditReader4031,2025-04-24T10:31:58,-9

He has enough people staged in positions of power that will gladly jump on board of this because of what it leads to. Enough won't stand up to him because they are complicit with the plot and treason.,rodentmaster,2025-04-24T10:49:38,8
"Requiring people to provide identification while simultaneously charging them a fee to get said identification is a poll tax and is illegal.  I am fine with an ID Law for voting if it's possible to get an eligible ID was free and not hugely burdensome. The fact that the GOP is focused on putting the restrictions in before even remotely discussing making government IDs free to obtain should tell you what this is _really about_.  edit: Consider this - if you're a poor person who needs to spend 100% of your income just to survive, how are you going to manage to pay for a passport? Usually you need to pay for the photo used and there's a fee to get a passport. So if you aren't able/willing to pay that fee you shouldn't be allowed to vote on who runs your country?",BonesIIX,2025-04-24T10:43:11,11
"> How would this even work?     That's the thing.    Whatever it is, it will trip up enough people to skew the voting totals a few percent.  And it's well established that the demographics of people who have trouble with these systems are low income voters.    If everybody was issued a Federal ID I wouldn't have a problem with this.  But Republicans won't support that because they're not acting in good faith.",Searchlights,2025-04-24T10:24:27,18

"Using the costs involved with a passport is disingenuous. A state issued driver license or non-driver identification is required to do a great many things in modern life. So again, how do those who are unable to obtain such identification for whatever reason able to function?",RedditReader4031,2025-04-24T13:20:11,-1
"You're moving the goalposts. You're now saying ""how could they not have an ID?""  ANY ID that costs money and is a requirement to vote is a poll tax and is illegal under the 24th amendment of the Constitution.  Even if they made drivers licenses free... lets humor that point.  The GOP has clearly stated that Drivers Licenses are not enough to be considered valid proof of citizenship. Their SAVE Act bullshit puts the line at Birth Certificate or Passport.  You might argue ""well getting a birth certificate shouldnt be too hard""  * Still costs money (Poll Tax) * What if you are an American who became a citizen as a child/adult? You are required to get a passport * What if you dont know where you were born exactly? Passport * What if you live far away from your place of birth and lack the ability to contact your old city hall to get a BC copy? Passport * What if you are a married woman and your BC doesnt match your married last name? Passport  As I said earlier, if sufficient government IDs were free and very easy to get for a homeless, disabled, or elderly person - sure I'm okay with the notion that we should have IDs to vote... BUT doing it now, at the hands of the party of voter suppression, it's nothing but a means to disenfranchise voters they dont believe will vote for them.",BonesIIX,2025-04-24T13:39:20,3
"Right-wingers have no problem erecting bureaucratic roadblocks in between people and their right to vote, but ask them how many would approve of a federally regulated proof-of-citizenship paperwork process in order for ownership of a firearm to exchange hands and you’ll see how many start complaining about bureaucratic federal overreach.",MrDangerMan,2025-04-24T13:53:05,1
"A very apt comparison.  I think the problem also lies in the fact that many not poor people dont understand how hard it would be to go through the entire process of getting even something ""simple"" like a drivers license or state issued ID. Cost aside, the time spent, during working hours, would be too much for many poor americans stuck working in inflexible service industry jobs. Are you willing to risk your job in order to get the ID to then be able to vote?",BonesIIX,2025-04-24T13:57:52,2
