Let's not allow Communist China to claim a heritage to Chinese land. They burnt and destroyed their history and culture with the Boxer Rebellion and then persecuted and/or starved millions. Their saber-rattling has turned into navel gazing.,BludgeIronfist,2025-04-15T11:24:56,24

You are a command and control economy, while that does give many benefits in a trade war, you know whats a much bigger bonus. Being a massively consumerist country that drives global markets to a degree that cant be replaced even if every other nation in the world were to band together.   Weve already seen plenty of reports that manufacturers and storehouses in china are on the brink of collapse because in many cases the vast majority or even all of their business partners are american importers.
