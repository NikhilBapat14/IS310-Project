They are making better decisions than the Supreme Court on immigration issues these days. The executive controls the refugee program. Trump added South Africa and discontinued other countries.,Dazzling_Pink9751,2025-04-22T16:36:37,15
Thatâ€™s astonishing. The 9th circus is generally one of the most liberally biased circuit courts in the country.,Tasty_Explanation_20,2025-04-22T16:52:08,12
"the administration is well within its rights to proceed with the suspension of the Refugee Admissions Program. Which, quite frankly, seems quite reasonable â€” a description I've not had occasion to use in relation to the 9th Circuit often, if ever.   It would be nice if some of the lower courts started to take notice.   More winning for MAGA ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-22T16:14:46,13
That is accurate but we are seeing the true expression of the Trump 45 vintage. He stopped the practice of getting the stamp of approval of the home state senators and that decision has aged exceptionally well.,Kahnspiracy,2025-04-22T18:25:48,7
