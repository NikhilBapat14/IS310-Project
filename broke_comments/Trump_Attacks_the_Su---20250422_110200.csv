"So not that I particularly expect SCOTUS to show a spine, or any kind of enforcement to happen, however:  You have nominally for-life appointees who are one of the few even vaguely viable checks on your power. Why telegraph that they have nothing to lose and everything to gain by betraying you, irrespective of what deals were made?

Donald Trump who abused due process in past by delaying everything related to his mutiple court cases including criminal ones is now oppressing the people by not giving them the due process they deserve.

Over here. Pay attention. The constitution exists to prevent one person (the ""me"" you mentioned) from making arbitrary decisions about who is a violent criminal or terrorist.

"“We cannot give everyone a trial, because to do so would take, without exaggeration, 200 years. We would need hundreds of thousands of trials for the hundreds of thousands of Illegals we are sending out of the Country. Such a thing is not possible to do,”  This is his understanding of trials and the court system. He assumes everyone is allowed to delay trials and do endless appeals and not have to worry about the staggering amount of money a good lawyer will cost to do all of these things.  Real question, what happens when one of his cult takes ~~queues~~ the cue to handle a judge permanently? Trump gets to install another justice and I assume the republicans will just blindly let it happen because the president can't be held responsible for the actions of a lunatic.

We will maintain a constant barrage of criticism against the Left. We will attack the very legitimacy of the Left...
