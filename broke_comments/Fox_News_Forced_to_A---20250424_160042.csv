Every single Trump supporter knew Trump was going to torpedo the country, they only wanted Trump in so they could openly be bigots, that's it, bottom line. They care more about the ability to freely step on people they hate than they do their own prosperity.  All the education in the world can't make people who are denying the facts embrace them.

"I'm not sure religion fully explains it. I think citing religion just moves the goalpost and creates a new problem: nearly every wealthy country exhibits low religiosity (compared to high religiosity in poor countries). Why then is America so religious?   I believe Barry Glasser answered this in his book, The Culture Of Fear. Citizens in poor countries have much to be afraid of and their economic and societal stability is often threatened or non-existent. So those citizens feel powerless to control their lives, and thus turn to an all-powerful deity or deities to provide protection. Americans should NOT feel this instability and uncertainty but are made to do so through compromised media (""invasion of the brown people!"", ""murderers at your doorstep!"", etc), lack of gun control (constant shootings), demonization of minority groups (those queers are coming to get you), dissolution of rights ( big gov wants your guns), and other issues. Most Americans, for example, have very little in savings and are one crisis away from absolute ruin. So they remain as religious as someone in a much poorer country, even though the wealth is there to improve the lives of every citizen in the country.   The result is Americans are afraid. They are afraid economically and socially. So religiosity remains high, but it's a sort of psuedo-manufactured religiosity, which is why there's so many holes, contradictions, and cherry picking with the ""faith"". It's the kind of religiosity you would have if people in power were pulling strings to ensure there are haves and have nots.   Just my 2 cents.",MyToesHugEachOther,2025-04-24T21:35:42,1
