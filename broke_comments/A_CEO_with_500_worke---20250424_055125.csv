"I know this is wishful thinking, but I hope all of these business owners remember that the entire Republican party was complicit in this.   But I know realistically they'll pinch their nose and vote Republican next time anyway.",labe225,2025-04-24T10:45:41,35

"In my limited experience working with business folks, some of them have extremely short memories, and are very easily excited (either enthusiastic or scared). Obviously not everyone one worked with, but enough that I've noticed the personality type.Â    My take, the ones voting maga aren't really looking at things beyond the next quarter. If trump just keeps promising short-term gains, they'll take a good amount of abuse before they abandon the possibility of a huge payout. But again, that's my personal take based on my personal experience",3qtpint,2025-04-24T11:32:36,5
