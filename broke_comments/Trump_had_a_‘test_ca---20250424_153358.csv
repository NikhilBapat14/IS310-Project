Of course none will be signed. Trump started trade wars with dozens of countries on his own with no real purpose. He doesn't know what he wants and there is no reason for other countries to placate him for his one sided aggression.,TheJadeGoddess,2025-04-24T15:47:38,1

Why would any country sign right now? They would have to be extremely gullible and even more desperate than the United States is. Trump has no clue what he’s doing. He is winging it and changing his positions constantly.,RamonaQ-JunieB,2025-04-24T15:54:58,1

">Indeed, speculation was rife that the visitor from Tokyo might even secure the “first mover” advantage touted by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent: winning advantageous terms as the country quickest to agree to a deal with the Trump administration.

"You need to tuck this in somewhere too, because this one ain't going away anytime soon,    China Just Turned Off U.S. Supplies Of Minerals Critical For Defense & Cleantech   https://cleantechnica.com/2025/04/05/china-just-turned-off-u-s-supplies-of-minerals-critical-for-defense-cleantech/   > What China did wasn’t a ban, at least not in name. They called it export licensing. Sounds like something a trade lawyer might actually be excited about. But make no mistake: this was a surgical strike. They didn’t need to say no. They just needed to say “maybe later” to the right set of paperwork. These licenses give Beijing control over not just where these materials go, but how fast they go, in what quantity, and to which politically convenient customers. >  > The U.S.? Let’s just say Washington should get comfortable waiting behind the rope line. The licenses have to be applied for and the end use including country of final destination must be clearly spelled out. Licenses for end uses in the U.S. are unlikely to be approved. What’s astonishing is how predictable this all was. China has spent decades building its dominance over these supply chains, while the U.S. was busy outsourcing, divesting, and cheerfully ignoring every report that said, “Hey, maybe 90% dependence on a single country we keep starting trade wars with and rattling sabers at is a bad idea.” >  > Try ramping up your semiconductor fab or solar plant when your indium source just dried up. It’s a fun exercise in learning which of your suppliers used to be dependent on Beijing but never mentioned it in the quarterly call. >  > The materials China just restricted aren’t random. They’re chosen with the precision of someone who’s read U.S. product spec sheets and defense procurement orders. Start with dysprosium. If your electric motor needs to function at high temperatures—and they all do—then mostly it is using neodymium magnets doped with dysprosium. No dysprosium, no thermal stability. No thermal stability, no functioning motor in your F-35 or your Mustang Mach-E. China controls essentially the entire supply of dysprosium, and no, there is no magical mine in Wyoming or Quebec waiting in the wings. If dysprosium doesn’t come out of China, it doesn’t come out at all. It’s the spinal cord of electrification, and right now China’s holding the vertebrae. >  > So here we are. China has responded to Trump’s tariffs by cutting off U.S. supply of some of the most essential ingredients of the modern world.",tech57,2025-04-24T16:09:39,1
"A really important part of a normal trade deal is that it is approved by Congress. This is hard to do (it takes years) but it means it's also very hard to change. This is a key feature of a trade deal -- you establish the ""rules of the road"" clearly for the foreseeable future and so businesses can rely on these rules because it's very hard to change them.  Trump isn't offering that. So he's not offering trade deals as we know them. He's using his emergency tariff powers to extort countries, so all he can offer are temporary handshake deals that can be changed at any time by him, another administration and will almost certainly be cancelled if the Dems win big in the midterm.   So it's not a surprise that countries aren't lining up to do ""trade deals"" -- these deals he's offering are terrible and there's no guarantee he won't rip them up tomorrow.  It makes way more sense to wait him out and hope that he cracks or the courts or Congress take away his ability to level these emergency tariffs. Unless he'll accept nothing real in exchange for some favorable headlines, I'm not sure why you would negotiate with this idiot when he can't offer you anything you can rely on in return.",rage_panda_84,2025-04-24T15:50:00,1
