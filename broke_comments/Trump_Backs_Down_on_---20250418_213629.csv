"The actual content of the article doesn't imply they're backing down, at least not immediately.  *A senior White House official said the administration stood by the letter, calling the university’s decision to publicly rebuff the administration overblown and blaming Harvard for not continuing discussions.*  *“It was malpractice on the side of Harvard’s lawyers not to pick up the phone and call the members of the antisemitism task force who they had been talking to for weeks,” said May Mailman, the White House senior policy strategist. “Instead, Harvard went on a victimhood campaign.”*  *Still, Ms. Mailman said, there is a potential pathway to resume discussions* ***if the university, among other measures, follows through on what Mr. Trump wants and apologizes to its students*** *for fostering a campus where there was antisemitism.*  I find it weird that they're doubling down while publicly saying they didn't mean to start the argument, but I guess it's consistent with admitting they deported someone by accident but still refusing to fix it.",thespelvin,2025-04-18T22:03:52,140

">“It was malpractice on the side of Harvard’s lawyers not to pick up the phone and call the members of the antisemitism task force who they had been talking to for weeks,” said May Mailman, the White House senior policy strategist. “Instead, Harvard went on a victimhood campaign.”  Trump's entire existence politically is a victimhood campaign.  They have zero grounds for accusing anyone else of the same.    And Harvard was the victim here.  They were threatened and they responded.
