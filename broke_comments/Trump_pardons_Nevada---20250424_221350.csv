Just a reminder that accepting a pardon is an explicit admission of guilt.  This should reflect on her ability to return to her job as a judge.  It won't.  But it should.,obligatorythr0waway,2025-04-24T22:32:22,1

"K but like… as much as I feel for you (if you’re American), you could totally fight back on a way more petty level. Honestly, why aren’t you crowdsourcing money to run digital advertising campaigns on this kind of shit that leads back to worthwhile causes and generates PPC money?  This admin runs a super effective “flood the zone” strategy where nothing ever sticks because there’s always some new BS to distract from the last one. The dems can’t keep up with it and would never do this. But if I were being a little unhinged (as an ex digital marketer & also a Canadian, so not really my place to start it) I’d start a grassroots campaign just flooding MAGA-heavy areas with super shareable, fact-checked content that doesn’t look like it’s from “the libs.” Go check the other sub for ways to write headings that get shared. Just confuse them.   Like:  - Meme-driven posts that feel organic and homemade - targeted ad buys in deep red zones - Stuff that sounds like it’s coming from inside the house — someone who’s “just asking questions” or “starting to wonder”  If you make it look like a frustrated uncle finally cracking, people will share it. MAGA folks eat that kind of “personal awakening” content up, especially if it’s subtle enough not to trigger defenses.  Anyway, I usually try to use my marketing brain for good… but if someone set this up, I’d 100% contribute. I’m also absolutely not insinuating disinformation. But come on.
