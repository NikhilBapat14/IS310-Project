"I’ve been a cop a long time, including 16 years as a detective.  I’ve sat down with, smiled at, bought food for, and treated with feigned warmth, all manner of criminals, from rapists, burglars, diddlers, murderers, and everything in between, with suspects from every race and background you can imagine.  It’s called “rapport building”.  The big picture is getting the defendant behind bars where they belong.  If I have to fake respect with a person who did horrific things to enhance the chances they pay for what they did, I’ll do that 10/10 times.",RazorSlaked,2025-04-17T20:21:25,49
They get mad when the cops treat suspects poorly but they also get mad when the cops treat the suspect well.,Mountain_Man_88,2025-04-18T15:31:29,5
"Yeah I would have thought this obvious. I expect just about everyone who has to function in society has had to shake the hand, or otherwise maintain a degree of civility, with someone they can't stand.   I think its just the fuax ""masculinity"" where a hand shake means the world, like gritty western promise.... It can be, it can also just be basic decorum not fit to carry the weight of the air around it.",thatfordboy429,2025-04-17T23:20:39,3
"I agree. The optics here don't look great, but sometimes you have to do things you disdain in an effort to accomplish the end goal. As well as what you mentioned, the feigned respect also puts the suspect at ease allowing for dialogue that may give you more evidence to provide the prosecutor.",letmeinfornow,2025-04-19T09:15:21,1
"I’m reminded of all the morons who flipped their wigs after the cops bought Dylan Roof Burger King.  If he said he was hungry and they didn’t feed him before going into hours of interrogation, his lawyer would have been able to get his statements tossed out based on the argument he was coerced and thus his statements were not voluntary and therefore inadmissible.  Could they have convicted him without the statements?  Probably, but you don’t throw out perfectly good nails that can go in the defendant’s coffin lid to appease the fickle court of public opinion.",RazorSlaked,2025-04-19T09:32:54,2
