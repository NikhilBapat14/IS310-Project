Please don't. Just stay away,Swissgirl2,2025-04-22T01:00:46,52
"After what he said on Easter? I know heads of state are suppose to attend these things, but it just feels wrong — like it sullies the Pope's name.    Maybe lightning will strike.",invalidpassword,2025-04-22T01:09:24,20
“We look forward to being there!” What the holy hell? Does he think this is some kind of party?!,Baremegigjen,2025-04-22T01:55:30,24
He just wants to shit himself in the vatican. He has a weird bucket list because he's demented.  He's a bit pissed playing second fiddle after Vance liptosucked the Popes soul with his charisma vacuum as the opening act.,theretortsonthisguy,2025-04-22T01:15:25,15
Please just stay away and leave the man to rest in peace.,damnthistrafficjam,2025-04-22T01:11:37,14

"That man has no business setting foot in the funeral of the finest pope we've had in generations. No, he didn't do everything that we may have wanted him to, but he did the possible. And he even did the impossible. A former bar bouncer from Latin America turns pope? He was a gift to the church.",PoetryJunior1808,2025-04-22T02:07:30,9
Holy water will start to boil.,sovlex,2025-04-22T01:16:47,9

I would love to see him seated outside of the church.,Junior-Addendum88,2025-04-22T01:59:09,5
Trump is the antithesis of everything Pope Francis stood for.  No doubt the most unreligious leader in the world will try to leech off his legacy.,Duanedoberman,2025-04-22T02:04:30,6
As an American Veteran I will hang my head in shame.,Ecstatic_Sign_6157,2025-04-22T06:05:37,4
The wrong part of me wants to see this. Trump triumphantly standing on his own cock for the world to see. Again.,UnkyDub,2025-04-22T01:21:59,3
I wonder how he will embarrass us this time? Will he stay in hotel if it is raining? Push through dignitaries to get a photo op? Storm the Conclave? Declare himself Pope?,markroth69,2025-04-22T02:50:20,3

"If given the chance to speak, he'll spout off something like:  ""Thank you all for coming to see me today.... I hear I'm in the running for the next Pope, and why not?? No one has done as much for God as I have, not even Jesus! Some people are saying Vatican City should be the 52nd state, and Francis was against it. Terrible. What a nasty pope he was. But you're all free from that, and I'm here now, but unless the manufacturing of the popemobile comes back to America, my beautiful tariffs will burn this holy city to the ground!""",geologicalnoise,2025-04-22T06:13:46,2
Trump *says* he will attend. That's not the same thing.,Banes_Addiction,2025-04-22T01:09:23,2

He is head of state .. there’s nothing wrong with him attending the funeral of the pope,welding_guy_fromLI,2025-04-22T02:37:26,-8
I'm surprised he just wouldn't burst into flame upon touch holy ground.,Cod_North,2025-04-22T01:04:02,26
His narcissism can't resist. He knows the eyes of the world will be on him.   In his mind he will be the most important person at the service.,-eYe-,2025-04-22T01:59:52,24
"The faithful in Rome have greeted Mr. Vance with shame, shame shouts. How will they greet Mr. Trump, who contradicts the life of the Pope in everything.",Spirited-Top3307,2025-04-22T05:08:10,5
This guy buried his ex-wife on his golf course for a tax break. Wouldn’t surprise me if he thought this was a party.,2HDFloppyDisk,2025-04-22T02:07:52,10
Hate to blemish your day but The Vatican is not an ICC member and there is a weird transit arrangement in place for visitors of the Holy Sea with respect to airports around Rome.,kaas-schaaf,2025-04-22T04:58:32,3
He was very very open to sinners being included in the church; maybe Pope Francis would hope Donald Trump's attendance might affect a change in him? A miracle?,Counterpoint-4,2025-04-22T04:51:41,1
"You know he's going to try and annex Vatican City now the Pope is gone.  It'll be another Greenland.  Except he can't send Usha and JD ahead for a ""cultural visit"" this time because we know how the last one turned out.",tropical_edition,2025-04-22T02:42:03,3
One of the few times I've laughed out loud on here. I can just see Trump making passive aggressive comments to some cardinal.,George_the_poinsetta,2025-04-22T02:57:08,1

I wish he would stay in the hotel if it was raining. Save the pope from having that thing of a human at his funeral at least,Lostsock1995,2025-04-22T04:01:54,1
"He won’t like the eulogy, so he’ll complain about how bad the the cardinals were. I’m sure the word “woke” will be in there, “illegal emigrants”",rom_rom57,2025-04-22T06:49:04,2

I guess maybe we'll finally get an answer on if god exists or not.,lizard_king_rebirth,2025-04-22T01:27:46,11
"He will probably also work hard to find some way to tarnish it or diminish Pope Francis, the Vatican, or religion generally. Wrecking someone else's big day is absolutely in the top 10 of the narcissist's playbook. But, big but, if he had a heart attack and died during the funeral that would not be terrible.",Hairy_rambutan,2025-04-22T03:02:07,9
