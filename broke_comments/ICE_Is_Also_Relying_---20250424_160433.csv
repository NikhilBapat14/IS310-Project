"If those sent to CECOT actually WERE criminals. The trump administration would be jumping with joy shoving it in our faces every felony and misdemeanor. The truth is, they don't show us this transparency because they don't actually have the evidence. And they would have done it from the get go, not weeks or months from when they were sent.",paxwells97,2025-04-24T16:06:17,1

"What's shocking is how easily checks and balances are disrupted when one party controls so much, and they are all acting like a zombie army enacting the whims of a madman.  The entire republican party is complicit.  It's not just the president, but the entire party and it's voter base have gone off the deep end.  I recently saw a post where 90% of republican voters still approve of this presidency.",mixplate,2025-04-24T16:44:37,1
