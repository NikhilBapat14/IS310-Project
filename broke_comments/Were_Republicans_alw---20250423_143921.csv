But people like her make me believe that even if they read the more common versions of the Bible that don’t have homophobic and racist self insert rhetoric. They would still be saying the same bullshit. It’s not because of Christianity that these people are this way. They nitpick different versions of the Bible that fit their personal beliefs.   And to anyone who has read my little rant. Remember that. Maga Christians believes in the same shill that most of our founding fathers called out the kings of England for pushing. Self inserted beliefs in Bibles that weren’t actual gospel.

"So regarding number 10 on that list, about disciplinary or adverse actions in regard to religion-based expression, I'm going to interpret that as the employer or co-worker is not allowed to write-up, terminate, sue or otherwise discipline a Christian employee for their OWN discriminatory and hostile acts against non-Christians or anyone else. For example, the Christian employee using homophobic or racial slurs in the workplace will not only now be considered acceptable but their ""God given"" right to do so.   Hmmm, sounds like an awfully slippery slope into allowing a free for all for workplace harassment of non-Christians or non-practicing Christians.",LivingIndependence,2025-04-23T20:44:23,2

"Lincoln was elected by northern liberals and progressives.  Lincoln would be a Democrat today.     I really wish we didn't put so much importance on arbitrary party names.  As party names don't mean anything unto themselves.  What matters is who is voting for that party, as voters vote for politicians that best reflect their values.  So essentially, the parties switched when the Confederates switched parties.  The Confederates didn't magically become the good guys all along when they started calling themselves 'Republicans'.  They simply kept electing the same hateful bigots they've always elected, just now it's under their newly adopted 'Republican' name.  That's how we got the 'Party of Lincoln ' waving the Confederate flag.",ShamelessLeft,2025-04-23T16:41:35,2
