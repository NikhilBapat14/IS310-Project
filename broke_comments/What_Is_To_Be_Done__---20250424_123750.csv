"The American Revolution was not an oppressed peasants' revolution; it was a bourgeois merchant's revolution.   The Canadians, who lived under pretty much the same laws as the Americans never had a revolution and they turned out fine.    The other problem with the American Revolution is that many of its leaders had drunk the Kool-Aid of the Enlightenment.   Reddit is dominated by Americans, who largely know nothing about history, so it may be necessary to explain that the Enlightenment was a philosophical movement in the 18th century that fetishized rationalism. It fetishized it so much that it is often known as the ""age of reason""   Its underlying premise was that human beings are fundamentally rational. If we had the freedom to make our own decisions we would be rational utility maximizers. As a result, America became one of history's first major popular democracies. (Earlier democracies such as the Athenian one had a very narrow franchise)    The problem is that there is no scientific support for the idea that human beings are fundamentally rational, and there is plenty of scientific evidence that we are not. There's plenty of evidence that human beings mainly make their decisions through their 'gut', 'vibe', tribal loyalty, the choices of other members of their community, superstition, and a whole bunch of other non-rational influences.    It was exactly through those factors that we ended up with the current fascist president.    ",Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-24T15:16:26,1
