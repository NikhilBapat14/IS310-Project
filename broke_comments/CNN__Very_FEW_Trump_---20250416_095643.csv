The Reddit echo chamber would have you believe that we all regret our votes. (LOL)  This place is really getting out of control with the bots and brigaders.,onlyBotsdownvote-me,2025-04-16T10:14:01,241

"I thought the media was going out of control in 2016 but they are REALLY ramping it up this time around. They're putting every waking second of Trump's life under the microscope yet they hardly wanted to take a glance at Biden whatsoever during his time in office.  Truthfully, if every president was put under this level of scrutiny a lot of people's entire worldview would come crashing down.  2025 is really showing us which Americans thrive off of reading headlines vs. which ones are actually thinking for themselves and doing their own research.",Sketch_Crush,2025-04-16T10:22:02,63

The narrative that people regret their vote comes from the left because they don't like Trump. It's just more projection and propaganda as usual. Nobody who voted for Trump thinks Kamala is a better option. She's a buffoon.,RandolphE6,2025-04-16T11:06:39,5

"They are indeed out of control.  And every month that they are out of control and acting bat shit crazy.  There are more people that give up on the media.  We are living in a time where the media landscape is changing in a bigger and faster way than we have ever experienced.     Newspapers were important for over 200 years.   Radio was important for a little over 100 years.    Television (over the air) was important for about a little over 60 years.   Cable TV was important for about 50 years.   Satellite TV was important for a little over 24 years.     Today all of the above industries are hurting for revenue growth.   All are experiencing declines in revenue and customers.    This is not a political prediction, but a business prediction.    Either MSNBC or CNN will not exist in the three years.    I also predict that one of the four major TV networks will drop their news coverage, or two of them will combine operations into a merged platform.    Having said all of this.  I have to wonder how long podcasts will be a big thing? I doubt that it is going to be over 15 years before podcasts are mainly a thing in the past.     Not because podcasts are bad, but just look at how the changes in technology evolve and media consumers follow the evolution.

"> I do hope the tariff situation comes to a close relatively quickly as that will be a problem if it drags out.  Agree, it's a risk and a gamble, but so far, so good as 90+ countries currently want to negotiate with Trump.

Then why does he have [three](https://propy.com/browse/bernie-sanders-real-estate/) of them?  >How is trump fulfilling campaign promises??  Offhand, he's hammering China flat and addressing decades-long free trade issues with other  countries with tariffs, he's resumed actual border security and increased deportations, and he's done everything he can to convince other NATO members that they need to to at least meet their minimum defense obligations if not exceed them, and exposed how much graft, waste, and corruption there is in just a tiny amount of federal spending.  EgG pRicEs are, as far as I can tell, both exaggerated and the result of the government paying farmers to kill chickens whether that addresses bird flu or not. They're also a weird and weak attempt at a gotcha point, so I can only assume you have no substantive objections or you'd have brought them up instead.   >Trump had done nothing to help the Trump voter  And?

You're nothing but a donor to him, if that.  >The only war is class war don't let culture war divide us  I disagree, because nothing had ever removed the divide between rich and poor except for rare instances where everyone was reduced to poverty or death, and while class conflicts are valid a monomaniacal focus on ""class war"" just leads to regular old war of the worst kind. Culture on the other hand, is entirely and 100% worth some warfare. Culture is what lasts, culture is makes civilization, and civilization is the greatest survival tool we have.
