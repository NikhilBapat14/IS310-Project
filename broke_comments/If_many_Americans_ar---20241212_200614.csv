So, because the wealthy and powerful don't want it, it won't happen. The only way we fix that is if we remove the wealthy from power. The tried and true method for doing so short of a bloody revolution is to adjust the tax structure so that billionaires don't exist and the average middle class person is capable of sustaining a family of 5 on one salary.

"> The United States is an oligarchy dressed up to look like a democracy.  When I was in elementary-high school, I've had several teachers tell me that America is a democracy.

He told us America is a democracy. The government/civics teacher from 11th grade also talked about different types of government and said the US was a democracy.

"Why mention Reagan? Education is fundamentally a state responsibility, not a federal one. Your focus should be on putting pressure on state governments to prioritize education funding and reform.  However, when it comes to higher education, the federal government has played a significant role in expanding student loans, beginning with LBJ’s administration. Over time, these expansions have coincided with rising tuition costs and a decline in state contributions, as states have increasingly relied on federal loans to fill the funding gap. This has created a cycle that needs to be addressed at both the federal and state levels.",tylerlinnebur,2024-12-17T12:33:13,0
"It's happened before. It takes a popular labor movement and a lot of organizing. But it's happened before. They'll try to stop it with everything they have, up to and including bullets. If you look at 20th century history, there's literal examples of striking workers fighting law enforcement and national guard in gun battles. The authorities will not tolerate a nationally mobilized, motivated, and labor activist movements idly. But they can't stop everyone. If a movement is widespread enough and enough people are behind it, they can't stop it. That's kind of what it takes though.  In the Great Depression the nation was on the brink and reformers appeared to fix the issues. It worked because everyone knew they needed to find a way out of the situation. Industrialists and the upper class were willing to sacrifice some of their stranglehold on power to prevent a mass popular uprising.

"I mean, there is such a thing as a bubble. One indicator of a bubble when the price of your stock and your actual expected future earnings aren't commensurate with one another. There are tons of companies out there who have suspect value and will likely never turn a profit, but their stock value is soaring. There are also companies out there who are only still afloat due to low interest rates and abundant venture capital, who would otherwise be out of business, and they're also over valued. But it's a big shell game because executives of these companies are largely paid in stock options, whose stock may not actually be more valuable than the paper its printed on, which they then use to take out those loans you mentioned. Then they buy mega yachts and real estate assets, or a newspaper, or an entire congressman, which have actual real value, which they use to convert into real material wealth. Then the economy inevitably goes tits up due to their financial shenanigans, and Uncle Sam comes to bail them out at tax payer expense.  Is the economy a scam? You be the judge. In either event, you're right. There has to be a point where we say ""this has to stop. It's insane.""",mr-louzhu,2024-12-16T12:42:48,2
I agree that the stock market is a major issue but not necessarily for the same reasons. I think the problem is the stock market requires any public company to maximize profit for the shareholders over any other consideration. If a CEO were to start paying higher wages or benefits then the shareholders would fire him or her and hire someone else who doesn’t mind underpaying people and increasing everyone’s work load while limiting benefits to the bare minimum that will keep a good enough workforce. Same is true for environmental issues - ecologically sound options cost more money and therefore receives pushback from shareholders. The only way out that I see is stronger regulations. Unfortunately a large swathe of Americans has been convinced that regulations are the true problem with the marketplace.,Kaddyshack13,2024-12-17T13:17:27,1

">This is an abomination of a comment.   Mostly it's diagnostic. We live under elite economic wealth domination. And that is an abomination.  >The American public will not agree to this.  Are you sure? There's a growing consensus in the US that systemic wealth inequality and corporate power are out of control. The radical neoliberal market extremism that became popular under Regan is falling out of vogue the world over because it's been a social disaster for society.  >This is **definitional** marxism. ""remove the Bourgeoisie""  You're referring to communism. Marxism mostly just analyzes historical cycles and social evolution in terms of material factors and class struggle. It's more diagnostic. Whereas, communism says the answer is to collectivize the means of production. Though, there are many schools of thoughts on how to do this. The one you learn about in school is Stalinism, since it makes for good propaganda, but it conveniently omits other examples of peaceful collectivism that were more market based and grassroots.  >This is also definition marxism. You don't seem to understand private property rights which western civilization is built on.  I didn't say abolish private property. I also didn't say remove the bourgeosie. I said make billionaires impossible. That still leaves lots of multi-millionaires running around living their best lives. It's just I'm saying you don't want have billionaires with enough money to buy up the media and your politician and put them in their back pocket. In a free and democratic republic, 10% of the population should not be controlling 80% of the wealth. The practical effect of this is you lose your free and democratic republic and it gets replaced with an autocratic plutocracy. I'm assuming this isn't your ideal preferred outcome, nor is it mine, so why are you so gung ho for ensuring that outcome via your market extremist beliefs?  I believe in mixed market economics. Private property and private industry remain essential parts of the nation's economic life but a robust welfare state and state funded services in key sectors such as healthcare and education also ensure that society's standard of living remains high for everyone regardless of their income bracket, whereas the political system remains free and democratic due to the resulting social stability that the welfare state ensures.  The top marginal tax rate used to be in excess of 70% in the US, and this was during America's economic heydey in the postwar period. The golden age of the American middle class. Right now, billionaires effectively pay a lower tax rate than the average middle earner by proportion of their income due to most of their income being from capital gains, whereas capital gains tax is much lower than most income taxes. On top of that, there are so many tax loopholes strategically peppered into the system by society's elites that a lot of wealthy people get away with paying little or nothing in taxes. This is a huge problem.  Now, what you're hearing is communism, communism, communism. Which is about as much as I expected. But your response is hyperbolic and ignorant. What I'm actually saying is the USA's political system should be more moderate and emulate the economic approach of the rest of the Western world. Which is to say, capitalist but with more economic guard rails to ensure a high standard of living for everyone while regulating the potential political corruption that results from an excessively extreme degree of material inequality.",mr-louzhu,2024-12-13T14:56:32,37

">When I was in elementary-high school, I've had several teachers tell me that America is a democracy.  Have you considered the possibility that what they teach you in grade school civics is just propaganda and should be viewed with skepticism?  >In that case we can just vote for politicians who will listen to the majority instead of the rich.  That's not how it works. Both major political powers have a monopoly on power in the US. And both major political parties have been taken over by wealthy elite interests. And both political parties hand pick their candidates so that they tow the party line, which conforms to the interests of wealthy elites. Any stragglers such as AOC or Bernie get disciplined during election cycles or bought off in congress during off-cycles. So the candidates voters are given to choose from are both establishment candidates. Whichever one gets into power will always ultimately cater to the preferences of the wealthy elites.  When your political system is thoroughly captured by wealthy special interests to the extent ours is, it will take a massive and overwhelming grass roots social movement to change that. But so far that type of movement has yet to materialize.  I mean, we have seen movements like that BEGIN to materialize such as Occupy and BLM. But if you have been paying attention, Occupy was violently suppressed in a police campaign coordinated at the Federal level. And for much of the 10's, BLM leaders kept dying under suspicious circumstances--gunshot, arson, killed while they sleep. This is part of a long tradition of US state suppression of political movements. In the late 19th and early 20th century they would actually deport or jail political activists who were agitating for greater working class rights. In the 50's, they used McCarythism to basically demolish anyone who voiced contrarian beliefs. In the 60's and 70's, they used the War on Drugs and COINTELPRO to go after activist movements of all stripes. In the 70's and 80's, they used neoliberal reforms and the southern strategy to bust the unions and turn the middle class into debt peons which are easily controlled. In the 2000's, they used the War on Terror to keep the population divided and distracted. In the 10's and 20's they resorted to using the culture wars and astroturf psy-op campaigns on social media to drive a wedge between people. Now here we are.",mr-louzhu,2024-12-13T12:02:24,14

"You are both talking political theory and philosophy and not real world structure or instances. Billionaires and millionaires are both apart of bourgeoisie. Reagan was a just a plain old conservative, if not close to a neoconservative. Stop thinking politics as a straight left to right line and start thinking of it more as a sphere because everything mixes and both left and right ideologies have authoritarian extremes. And Marx did go into political structure. He preached a cashless society of the type that Lenin had tried and it failed and USSR had to bring back the ruble. And when it came to medicine and healthcare, a committee of doctors did decide who got what level and type of healthcare and who did not under Marxist theory. When you talk about percentages and who pays what, percentages are misleading because it is based on elements that may not be equal in one sample to another. 1% of one person’s income maybe more than another’s entire income. Talk dollars. The average wage in the USA is $69,392 in 2020, 2024 tax bracket is 22% which equals $15,266.24 I think. A billionaire’s bracket regular income tax is 37% 2025 (and a Biden tax hike is coming) which is $370,000,000. But you were talking capital gains tax. The current capital gains tax top bracket is 20%. 20% of $1,000,000,000 is $200,000,000. The difference for a billionaire between $370,000,000 and $200,000,000 is $170,000,000 which is still all 3 are still at least $199,984,733.76 higher than the $15,266.24 what the average median wage earner pays in income taxes.

"Oh, you mean the amount of money taken out for taxes of every dollar you earn? Not that hard to understand that is what “marginal tax rates” means, Bugbear 259. It is hard to take anybody who shouts ”the Rich don’t pay their fair share” seriously when they don’t understand what the problem is. They don’t understand that for every dollar the median average tax payer earns and pays .22 per dollar at 22%, a single billionaire earns (rounded up) $14,410.89 paying .37 cents for every dollar at a 37% based tax rate. Aka, for the .22 cents tax for the single dollar the average taxpayer, the billionaire pays at least $5,332.03 (rounded up) in taxes to every .22 cents per dollar of your taxable income.… at base tax rates. The problem comes in is that the billionaires, like many taxpayers, is looking to find a way to pay less taxes too and has found it in the capital gains tax which is cheaper than the regular income tax. They still pay more than you in actual dollars in taxes but they pay less of it because they don’t give themselves a large wage but live off of the dividends of their stocks or their share of the profits of the businesses they own.  Pretty much like what mr-Louzhu has been saying.

"1st, I saw your comment before you had edited it and removed “10%”. 2ndly, you are so wrong when you said, “Everyone is taxed the same on each dollar earned for each marginal rate for each income type (W-2, capital gains, etc)”  I had used tax information in my statement. And this statement from the source I had used, which also shows the tax brackets directly contradicts your statement. https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/marginal-tax-rate/#:~:text=The%20marginal%20tax%20rate%20is,additional%20dollar%20earned%20as%20income. Statutory Marginal Tax Rates  In terms of the U.S. federal income tax system, your statutory marginal tax rate corresponds to the highest tax bracket you face (see below). This is considered “statutory” since it simply describes the top income tax bracket your income falls into as set by federal or state law.“ Tax brackets have different marginal rates and the source shows the tax brackets. But in my statement did not include deductions like Child deduction, personal deduction, or earned income tax credit that may change your level of income into another bracket. And before to fast talk your way around this, I did click on the “income tax” button (which led me to this page - https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/individual-income-tax/), and the “Payroll Tax” button that lead me to this page: https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/payroll-tax/ . From that payroll tax page, it says that the only tax that is the same marginal rate or percentage are the government payroll taxes for “Social Insurance “ programs, not income taxes. It says, “A payroll tax is a tax paid on the wages and salaries of employees to finance social insurance programs like Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment insurance. Payroll taxes are social insurance taxes that comprise 24.8 percent of combined federal, state, and local government revenue, the second largest source of that combined tax revenue” and “In the U.S., the largest payroll taxes are a 12.4 percent tax to fund Social Security and a 2.9 percent tax to fund Medicare, for a combined rate of 15.3 percent. Half of payroll taxes (7.65 percent) are remitted directly by employers, with the other half withheld from employees’ paychecks. This withholding shows up as FICA (Federal Insurance Contributions Act) and MEDFICA (Medicare Federal Insurance Contributions Act) on payroll stubs. Self-employed individuals remit both the employer and employee side of payroll taxes.” While those remain the same for “ While ‘everyone is is taxed the same on each dollar earned for each marginal rate for each income type’ (your words), those are not income taxes and income level or brackets are not taxed at the same marginal rate, even on W-2s. From the page on income taxes it says, “An individual income tax (or personal income tax) is levied on the wages, salaries, investments, or other forms of income an individual or household earns. The U.S. imposes a progressive income tax where rates increase with income.” And “The U.S. income tax is progressive, which means that tax rates (the percentage of your income that you pay in taxes) increase as taxpayer income increases. The U.S. levies income tax rates ranging from 10 percent to 37 percent that kick in at the specific income thresholds outlined below. The income ranges for which these rates apply are called tax brackets. All income that falls within each bracket is taxed at the corresponding rate.” the marginal rate (the amount out of per dollar ) increases with each tax bracket increase. If any thing , I got the amount of the capital gains tax on realized capital gains wrong. It is a lower percentage 15% to 20%. But still the math is correct when converted into dollars because of the different amounts being taxed. That is why I says that the percentages are misleading. Just because the capital gains taxes in some incidences (capital gains taxes cover a wide area, https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/taxes/realized-capital-gains#:~:text=Long%2Dterm%20capital%20gains%20are,your%20ordinary%20income%20tax%20rate.) are lower percentages than many income brackets, doesn’t necessarily mean a billionaire with a few million in stock is going to pay a lower dollar amount in taxes than the average taxpayer.",Puzzleheaded-Home334,2024-12-18T04:28:46,1
I didn’t edit my comment nor mention anything about “10%” - maybe you have me confused with another commenter.  You are copying things you are finding on the internet but you still aren’t comprehending them.  The list of marginal tax rates is for each marginal dollar earned at that rate.  You don’t seem to understand that.  That’s why your math is all wrong.,Bugbear259,2024-12-18T10:19:04,1
"No sir. I do understand. I also do research before opening my mouth up. The fact that I was able find, copy, and post quotes in their correct context* proves that I was able to find facts and evidence of what I said. That is how I am able to prove your statement was wrong.  Look, I tried of all the bandwagoning echo chambers on the far liberal side who were tricked into repeating bandwagon (the repeat is intentional), bandwagon propaganda they don’t look uneducated or ignorant, or not cool. Specially when they call a person with a college degree not as educated as they are simply because that person disagreed with them or punctured one of their viewpoints. I’m sorry if I have punctured one of yours.  * That is the reason why the quotes are so long. It was in order to show the exact context they were said in.",Puzzleheaded-Home334,2024-12-18T14:32:41,1
"You found the chart.    You don’t understand how to read and apply the chart.    In other words, even with the correct chart in front of you, you can’t correctly calculate taxes using the chart.  This is actually pretty common.  Most people are just like you and don’t understand how marginal tax rates work.      You are part of the majority of people who don’t know how to calculate taxes using a marginal rates chart.    The wild part to me is your absolute refusal even for a second to think you might not know what you’re talking about.  Have you ever admitted to being wrong about anything your whole life?",Bugbear259,2024-12-18T16:53:15,1
