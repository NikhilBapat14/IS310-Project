"This would be a great idea and I would love to see it implemented but you can't do it with current House districts because you have monstrosities like Denton and Amarillo in the same district and that's not something you can give an easy name to.   I also think the Canadian naming would likely work better, so you can combine multiple city names for districts that include multiple relevant cities (so for instance PA-10 could be Harrisburg-York, MI-3 could be Grand Rapids-Muskegon, IA-02 could be Cedar Rapids-Waterloo - the AI seems to have gotten that wrong, IA-02 doesn't contain Davenport)",kalam4z00,2025-04-05T21:48:11,6
Making good names would be hard for two reasons:  The House of Representatives districts are big compared House of Commons districts. We could add more seats to make the districts smaller.  Some districts have weird shapes because of Voting Rights Act concerns or gerrymandering. They would hard to name.,balletbeginner,2025-04-06T16:29:23,4
"Perhaps giving geographic names could make it harder to gerrymander... the average voter might not be able to remember the number of their congressional district, but is likely to notice if it is named for a place nowhere near to where they live because they live in a non-geographically sensible gerrymandered district!",TheTallestTexan,2025-04-06T16:57:47,4
"I could come up with some great names, like: The Absurdly Gerrymanderd Anti-Hispanic District of Las Vegas, the Despicably Gerrymandered Districts of Greater Salt Lake City, the Ridiculous Anti-democratic District of Any Big City in Texas, etc. etc.",CishetmaleLesbian,2025-04-06T18:41:27,3
