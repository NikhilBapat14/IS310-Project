Primaries are a good thing if the incumbents are so great they should have no problem winning. This is the stuff that angers me the most about the party they claim to be democratic but within the party they clearly are not. They are more then happy to put there fingers on the scale to get rid of progressives and primary them.  I wont be voting for my representative Marie Perez and will be angry if they undermine anyone who runs a primary against her.,sedatedlife,2025-04-24T17:25:09,1

"> I feel like you are making this more complicated than it needs to be.  It's called painting the bicycle shed. Comes up A LOT when progressives make the news.  Law of triviality   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality   > The law of triviality is C. Northcote Parkinson's 1957 argument that people within an organization commonly give ***disproportionate weight to trivial issues***.[1] Parkinson provides the example of a fictional ***committee whose job was to approve the plans for a nuclear power plant spending the majority of its time on discussions about relatively minor but easy-to-grasp issues, such as what materials to use for the staff bicycle shed***, while neglecting the proposed design of the plant itself, which is far more important and a far more difficult and complex task.    >  > The concept was first presented as a corollary of his broader ""Parkinson's law"" spoof of management. He dramatizes this ""law of triviality"" with the example of a committee's deliberations on an atomic reactor, contrasting it to deliberations on a bicycle shed. As he put it: ""The time spent on any item of the agenda will be in inverse proportion to the sum [of money] involved."" ***A reactor is so vastly expensive and complicated that an average person cannot understand it (see ambiguity aversion), so one assumes that those who work on it understand it. However, everyone can visualize a cheap, simple bicycle shed, so planning one can result in endless discussions because everyone involved wants to implement their own proposal and demonstrate personal contribution.***[4] >  > ***After a suggestion of building something new for the community, like a bike shed, problems arise when everyone involved argues about the details***. This is a metaphor indicating that it is not necessary to argue about every little feature based simply on having the knowledge to do so. Some people have commented that the amount of noise generated by a change is inversely proportional to the complexity of the change.[3] >  > Behavioral research has produced evidence which confirms theories proposed by the law of triviality. ***People tend to spend more time on small decisions than they should, and less time on big decisions than they should***. A simple explanation is that during the process of making a decision, one has to assess whether enough information has been collected to make the decision. If people make mistakes about whether they have enough information, then they will tend to feel overwhelmed by large and complex matters and stop collecting information too early to adequately inform their big decisions. The reason is that big decisions require collecting information for a long time and working hard to understand its complex ramifications. This leaves more of an opportunity to make a mistake (and stop) before getting enough information. Conversely, for small decisions, where people should devote little attention and act without hesitation, they may inefficiently continue to ponder for too long, partly because they are better able to understand the subject.[5]  >",tech57,2025-04-24T18:48:12,1
">lived in CA at the time and having the News outlets and the DNC calling the state for Clinton before the election really kick off I am sure turned people who would have voted for Sanders away.  The DNC and the media didn't call California for Hillary before the election started.

Seeing how Bernie would have needed to win California with 86% of the vote to stop that it was the truth (and even then he would have just stopped her rather than secure the nomination himself).  However, that reporting also angered the Clinton campaign who feared it would lower the turnout.
