"How can we explain the world's underlying order? How does consciousness emerge? And why do people from such different cultures have such similar near-death experiences? In a new episode of the *EconTalk* podcast hosted by [Russ Roberts](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/russ-roberts), [Ross Douthat](https://www.nytimes.com/column/ross-douthat), *New York Times* columnist and author of the new book *Believe: Why Everyone Should Be Religious,* argues that these and other unanswerable questions underscore his argument for the rationality of religious belief. Douthat and Roberts discuss Douthat's reasons for embracing faith with confidence, why science only bolsters his belief, and why he thinks that more religion would be a good thing for society. The duo also considers the tax treatment of religious institutions in the US and the prospects of artificial intelligence systems gaining consciousness. ",HooverInstitution,2025-04-14T14:12:05,4
