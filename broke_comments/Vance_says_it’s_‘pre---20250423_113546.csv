You know what’s also crazy? The trophy was fine just before he touched it.      You know what’s also crazy? The tourists killed in India were alive until he landed in India.,hospitallers,2025-04-23T11:49:21,14

"Just look at his face (Vance, not the Pope) is enough to get my blood pressure up. Let alone having any kind of conversation with him. Maybe the Pope can do miracles but converting Vance into a decent human being requires more than miracles.

"Vance is what sailors used to call a ""Jonah,"" a cursed sailor who brought calamity and destruction to every ship he sailed on.   Disaster and tragedy follow Vance like toilet paper stuck to the bottom of Trump's shoe.",Beantown-Jack,2025-04-23T11:50:37,19
It's heartbreaking that the pope spent his last moments in this world trying to convince Vance to treat immigrants like humans and basically behave like a decent human being himself. I suspect the effort was more than Pope Francis' heart could take.,kh-38,2025-04-23T11:51:48,14
