Harvard should never ever go for a deal.  The administration has zero credibility to keep their end of the deal.,thieh,2025-04-23T07:11:41,23

">Dr. Garber seemed to concede that the White House had raised reasonable issues about antisemitism. “We agree with a lot of what is in the government’s letter,” Dr. Garber said, according to a person on the call.  This is the problem, I don't know how the fuck this is something one of the Harvard leaders is saying. There is no new antisemitism problem. The antisemitism that no doubt exists is the same antisemitism that has always been in the background.  What is new is the state of Israel (not interchangeable with Jews), getting well out over its skis, and just straight up committing genocide. Something that, unsurprisingly, galvanized students to protest against its actions in Gaza and the US's material support for it.  How do these people not see that this is all one big scheme to erode freedom of speech? It's so goddamn obvious to anyone with their head screwed on correctly!",BurstSwag,2025-04-23T08:18:58,9

Anyone pressuring Harvard to strike a deal with Trump should be publicly named and shamed forever.,teedeeguantru,2025-04-23T07:29:29,6

Making a deal with Trump is making a deal with the devil. You don't make a deal with him because he never respects it anyway. The only thing he respects is when you meet force with force and beat him at his own game.,TopEagle4012,2025-04-23T07:21:38,6
No deals!  Especially for an institution that is known for its lawyers.  We need MORE institutions and people in law that AREN'T bending to this administration.,CouchCorrespondent,2025-04-23T08:01:26,5

"Despite not receiving as much news as Harvard, Georgetown University Law Center also chose to uphold its commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, even amidst increasing pressure from the Trump administration to dismantle such programs. ￼ Georgetown also deserves a ton of recognition for maintaining its values.  In February, interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, Ed Martin, appointed by President Trump, sent a letter to Georgetown Law Dean William Treanor. In it, Martin warned that his office would cease considering Georgetown Law students for internships, fellowships, or employment opportunities unless the institution terminated its DEI-related programs.  ￼ ￼  Dean Treanor responded by reaffirming the law school’s dedication to its DEI curriculum, emphasizing that such efforts are integral to its mission as a Jesuit and Catholic institution. He highlighted that fostering dialogue among individuals of diverse backgrounds is essential to promoting intellectual, ethical, and spiritual understanding.  ￼  The Georgetown Law community, including student organizations like the Coalition for Justice, has expressed strong support for Dean Treanor’s stance. They view the administration’s attempts to curtail DEI initiatives as unconstitutional and contrary to the values of academic freedom and inclusion.  ￼ ￼  This situation reflects a broader national problem, as the Trump administration has issued tyrannical executive orders aimed at reducing or eliminating DEI programs across various educational institutions. Despite these challenges, Georgetown Law and Harvard remain steadfast in their commitment to fostering inclusive academic environments",Proof-Delay-602,2025-04-23T21:46:08,2
