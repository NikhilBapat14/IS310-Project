Que photo of Nazis being ashamed of their atrocities. I can’t send images in comments.,Carl-99999,2025-04-15T19:01:19,17
Guys ima be so honest this is probably just dirt or mud  There are so many more verified horrors at CECOT,Eternal_Flame24,2025-04-15T20:38:50,34

"I pulled these screenshots from Google Earth desktop, where you can view a larger volume of historical satellite images. These screenshots show the progression of time between 11/23 - 4/25.   In the most recent image, we can see additional ""trails"" of the dark stain coming out of the building.",chasingthewhiteroom,2025-04-15T13:25:29,24

This is qanon level evidence. We don't deal in this,B_Boooty_Bobby,2025-04-16T07:06:51,3
Cool. Good thing we passed the CR to keeps the government running.,dtisme53,2025-04-15T20:07:30,4
This is not a body pit and you are distracting from real issues by acting like you are smarter than every human rights organizations and intel agency.,alienatedframe2,2025-04-15T21:30:38,4
"It amazes me that people are here arguing semantics when this shouldn't even be a debate. There should be no people being deported there, period. The fact that defenders of trump want to argue over the conditions vs the fact that we just rounded up people and sent them here is atrocious.",owlincoup,2025-04-16T11:37:07,4
So you think in March of 2024 and 2023 there was a death camp in the western hemisphere readily visible on google maps and the Biden admin said nothing about it? No one in the world cared to mention it?,alienatedframe2,2025-04-15T22:35:46,-12
Agreed. Please I urge everyone to read this. This prison is death sentence…  https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-05-29/inmates-in-el-salvador-tortured-and-strangled-a-report-denounces-hellish-conditions-in-bukeles-prisons.html,Old_Specific7310,2025-04-16T02:43:53,19
"The direct implication of this post is that there was a publicly visible death camp in the western hemisphere during the Biden admin and they just forgot to mention it. And that’s how you know nobody in here really believes it was a death camp, and are just playing along.",alienatedframe2,2025-04-15T22:37:05,-25
The last four Google Earth satellite image updates from CECOT (the labor prison in El Salvador) showing a newly constructed building which seems to have a continuous flow of dark liquid coming out of it,chasingthewhiteroom,2025-04-15T18:48:18,15
"Not sure how posting satellite photos is ""acting like I'm smarter than every human""...   the potential for CECOT featuring a kill site *is* a real issue and those human rights organizations and ""intel agencies"" you mention *are* looking into this specific issue to the best of their abilities",chasingthewhiteroom,2025-04-15T21:44:17,10
"The United Nations subcommittee on the prevention of torture is one of many organizations that have spoken out against the conditions at this facility. I can’t speak to the photos, and I don’t know that it’s even necessary given the hard data available.   Curious what you think the OP is distracting from here.

There was plenty of reporting about the bullshit Bukele has been up to. It's not like he was hiding it.,RellenD,2025-04-16T14:09:05,2
A foreign death camp probably wasn't on many Americans radars until Americans started getting sent there,bwheelin01,2025-04-16T03:47:56,18
"It’s not a kill site. It’s a bad prison, but it’s not a kill site, and you should stop role playing as a UN investigator.",alienatedframe2,2025-04-15T21:48:13,-7
Do you have a source for this information? Otherwise you have no basis,WestworldIsLife,2025-04-15T22:02:14,11
"Can anyone reliable actually confirm that? Unless you can somehow prove what you're saying, your words are pretty meaningless. Saying something over and over again doesn't make it true unfortunately.   And again, I'm not saying this is absolutely a kill site. I'm saying it's a building that's been oozing red fluids for a year",chasingthewhiteroom,2025-04-15T22:24:47,3
They're killing people through wasting away and malnutrition at the very minimum.  It's a death camp,RellenD,2025-04-16T14:10:46,1
"I 100% recommend looking into CECOT but the truth is, it's not his job to provide a source really. He's not the one making the claim so to speak",SmoothGardens,2025-04-16T12:18:28,2
"What’s their basis? Blurry google images? My basis is there is not human rights organization calling it a death camp, there is no intelligence agency or state department in the world calling it a death camp, there’s only redditors who think they are Sherlock Holmes. The other person is the one making an extremely bold claim with no evidence to back it up, the burden is on them to prove that this is a kill site.",alienatedframe2,2025-04-15T22:23:32,-4
"You are the person making the extremely bold claim, the burden is on you. You are the one saying this is a kill site, against the word of every world government and human rights org. You prove your claim.",alienatedframe2,2025-04-15T22:25:58,8
I literally just said I'm not claiming it's a kill site but hit your monologue buddy,chasingthewhiteroom,2025-04-15T22:27:49,6
"What are you implying then? Say it, don’t just make a vague implication and then leave it. Make a claim with your chest, if you can even muster the courage to do that on an anonymous platform.",alienatedframe2,2025-04-15T22:29:29,5
