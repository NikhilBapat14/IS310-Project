"I'll bite. Politics isn't a classroom debate that exists independent of context.   I'm on the left. Not too long ago people liked to tell liberals and leftists who were worried about the USSC overturning of Roe v Wade that they were overreacting. It was settled precedent, you see, and Gorsuch, Kavanuagh, Barrett, even Alito, had all testified that they would respect precedent. And then Roe got overturned. The mainstream media was absolutely shocked, which is insane, given that overturning Roe v Wade had been the cornerstone of the conservative legal movement for 40+ years.  What I'm getting at is that, when Trump says he's concerned about illegal immigrants and is going to deport them, I think it's very naive to ignore the fact that [anti-immigration, white supremacists Stephen Miller] (https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/stephen-miller) is going to be his deputy chief of staff. It's naive to ignore the fact the past and future head of ICE, [Tom Homan, has stated the family separation won't be a problem, because he's fine deporting entire families, including American citizens] (https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/10/tom-homan-ice-mass-deportation-family-separation-60-minutes/). Hell, Trump himself has promised to deport 15M people. There are only an estimated 11M illegal immigrants in the US.  I'm not constructing an ideological straw-man. I've looked at the political landscape recognized that I'm being lied to. When they claim to be talking about illegal immigrants, they're not just talking about illegal immigrants.   So, sure, are there people who are fine with immigrants, as long as they go through legal channels? Sure. But I'm not interested in an abstract discussion divorced from reality. I'm interested how the people in power will wield that power.",vinnie_puh,2024-11-18T19:29:17,10
The Roe point is absolutely true. I used to volunteer with crisis pregnancy centers and they'd explain how the primary purpose of campaigning to overturn Roe was because they knew it would never happen but it riled up the bleeding heart Christians into funding the pregnancy centers and adoption grant resource fund.,WanderingLost33,2024-11-19T00:31:43,3
