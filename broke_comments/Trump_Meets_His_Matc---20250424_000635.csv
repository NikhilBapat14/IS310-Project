"Non-paywalled gift link. Excerpt:  > WASHINGTON—President Trump has met his biggest opponent—and it’s the stock market.  > Since returning to Washington three months ago, Trump has toppled federal agencies, consolidated executive power, challenged global alliances and reconfigured America’s economic relationships around the globe. His moves have been met with protests, court challenges, dipping poll numbers and political opposition.  > Yet so far, the only force that has reliably prompted him to back down is Wall Street.   > In recent weeks, Trump has softened his economic and trade stances following periods of market turmoil. Early this month, he imposed a 90-day pause on many of the tariffs he had put in place just days earlier, as the stock market cratered and a selloff of U.S. bonds rattled investors. This week, he softened his tone on China after ratcheting up tariffs on imports from the country to 145%. And he ruled out—for now—attempting to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell after his public musings about terminating him triggered another market plunge.",nosotros_road_sodium,2025-04-24T00:06:59,6
"Soft as a poached egg, this wasteman President. Even if people didn't know that The Apprentice was a second-string version of the original plan to make a show about Russian Oligarchs until the KGB convinced Barnett to make a show starring Trump, they should at least have figured out that it was satire. It was meant to be a show like as if William Hung had been set up as a vocal coach for American Idol.  I've seen Dolan Trunk since the mid-80s, he's an absolute waste of tape. The problem is that people who buy into WWF got invested in his manufactured persona.",4ivE,2025-04-24T01:27:15,3

Trump would meet his match in that pond full of leeches from the movie *Stand By Me*.,NotAPreppie,2025-04-24T06:06:38,1
"You mean the markets that he deliberately crashed and then restored with his various tariff announcements, allowing him and his buddies to make ungodly profits due to blatant insider trading?",JDGumby,2025-04-24T06:34:23,1
"Oh but they do. They look at your fantasy narrative, assume (correctly) that you're going to drive the country off the cliff, and react accordingly.  The markets are susceptible to hype though, just not to the ones Trump's base hungers for. This disconnect (and mutual exclusion) between what he has to say / do to keep his rabid followers happy and what he needs to say /do to keep the markets happy is actually worse for economic stability than if he did nothing and just went golfing for four years.  It's also worth noting that his followers don't like the stock market in the same way they don't like most things and people. They only care about it in so much as it fits into a narrative denouncing their enemies or praising their own leaders. It could crash tomorrow and they wouldn't really care, either ignoring it or flat out lying about it. That in itself will depress confidence in the government's capacity and willingness to maintain stability.",barryvm,2025-04-24T04:34:07,5
