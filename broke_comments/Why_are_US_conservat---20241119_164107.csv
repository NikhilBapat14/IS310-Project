"The two conflicts are thought of quite differently, speaking as a former conservative myself. We can stitch together a good answer from the evidence from Trump's first term, and how the modern conservative movement talks about the conflict.     Short Summary: **\*\*Conservatives are against funding Ukraine because of Trump's personal animosity against the country, top donor and adviser's empathy for Russia's position, and apathy about the stakes of the war either in Ukraine or Israel.\*\***     I'll break down the evidence from here to make the argument:  Part One:    **\[\*\*1. Remember that Trump was first impeached in 2019 due to his attempt to blackmail Ukraine into announcing a public investigation into his political rival by withholding military aid and support.\*\*\]**([https://www.vox.com/c/2020/2/6/20914280/impeachment-trump-explained](https://www.vox.com/c/2020/2/6/20914280/impeachment-trump-explained))     The source above explains the details but the origin of the impeachment was because of a call Trump placed to the President of Ukraine directly asking him to investigate President Joe Biden's son so that he had something to smear him with ahead of the US presidential election in November. A whistleblower identified the call logs had been scrubbed, and identified Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani in concert with sympathetic businessmen in Ukraine and Russia were sent to negotiate further with Ukraine.     The specific ask, captured on the call logs between Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, was for Ukraine to ""do a favor"" and open an investigation into CrowdStrike (a cybersecurity company that was the subject of an election-related conspiracy theory Trump appeared to believe in) and to discuss with Rudy Giuliani an investigation into Hunter Biden.     Ukraine did not do this, although Zelenskyy's aide apparently entertained a chat with Giuliani. Because Ukraine did not follow through, Trump's administration did indeed withhold military aid mentioned on the phonecall that had already been approved for export. This led to a public investigation - of Trump - in the US by Congress, and ultimately to his impeachment. Trump has had a personal animosity against Ukraine ever since, according to lev Parnas, who was one of his original envoys in the blackmail effort alongside Rudy Giuliani: \[Why Donald Trump ‘hates Ukraine’ – POLITICO\]([https://www.politico.eu/article/why-donald-trump-hates-ukraine-us-congress-kyiv-war/](https://www.politico.eu/article/why-donald-trump-hates-ukraine-us-congress-kyiv-war/))    \[Even further back, there was relatively little pushback from the Republican Party when Trump's top advisers asked to remove ""support for Ukraine"" from the official party platform in 2016.\]([https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mueller-asked-trump-2016-rnc-platform-change-ukraine/story?id=59476035](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mueller-asked-trump-2016-rnc-platform-change-ukraine/story?id=59476035))",[deleted],2024-11-28T09:33:21,1
"The short and sweet of it - [Israel is an ally ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel%E2%80%93United_States_relations)and Ukraine is not.  That's a big influence.  From here, things get a bit complicated and reams of digital ink could be burned in writing every possible way, but I'm going to focus on one point that I think is the ultimate reason: **Israel can win its war at our current level of support, Ukraine cannot.**  Unless we start giving much more lethal aid or directly intervene ourselves, there simply is no route for Ukraine to reclaim their lost territories.  While they were able to repel the initial attacks (especially in the north near Kyiv), you can find [time lapses showing the lines/territory](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/733fe90805894bfc8562d90b106aa895) and see that its basically settled into a front line in the east and along Dnipro River in the south - which is to be expected as rivers make for good fortification.  But in this case its also a problem for Ukraine, too, as they have to cross that river as well.  If we (or any European nation) is not willing to intervene and fight to help Ukraine retake those territories, then, in my view, it is almost immoral to continue to support Ukraine in what is a meatgrinder with one or two results - Ukraine eventually loses as Russia grinds on or we reach a stalemate where Russia itself finds its gains acceptable and stops pushing.  If we have to choose between a stalemate and a loss, I'll take the stalemate and believe we should push Ukraine to formalize it in a peace treaty.  Is it ideal?  Absolutely not.  I'd rather Ukraine kick in Russia's teeth... but they don't seem to have that capacity and at some point demographics start coming into play.  Does Ukraine want to sacrifice a [generation of young men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War#Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine)?  Compare that to Israel.  Hamas is all but defeated and the only reason it isn't... is due to the US constantly wanting Israel to be careful.  Its been so successful that its decided to open a second front and attack another group that has attacked it over the years in Lebanon and achieved the same result - Hezbollah has been critically degraded and [Lebanon is not in control of much of its south](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/the-price-lebanon-is-paying-for-the-hezbollah-israel-war), and Israel can strike anywhere in the country seemingly at will.  Even Iran, who twice has [fired at Israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/02/west-defend-israel-iranian-attack), did basically no damage while[ Israel struck back into Iran with almost no issue](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr0yvrx4qpo).     Now, all this said, I think the US policy *is correct* in that we do not want either war to become something bigger - we do not want Russia to use nukes and we do not want Israel and Iran to go to war with each other.  With all of that above and those goals in place, what is the most likely want to achieve that?  Ultimately, it means pushing Ukraine to be realistic and pressing Israel to use restraint as necessary.  And I think we can achieve both under either Biden or Trump.",LordFoxbriar,2024-11-21T14:00:19,-2

"**\*\*2. Russia has made a concerted - and successful - effort to influence top advisers within Trump's inner circle and the upper echelons of the Republican Party.\*\***     Little remembered now is the case of Maria Butina, a Russian intelligence officer that went undercover within the Republican Party to influence it from the inside, largely through growing connections to key Republican fundraisers and affiliated organizations like\[ Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne\]([https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/maria-butina-russia-spy-fbi-860256/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/maria-butina-russia-spy-fbi-860256/)) (a top Trump donor) and the \[National Rifle Association\]([https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44885633](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44885633)). This is but one example of a larger problem: There appears to have been a concerted effort by the Russian intelligence apparatus to at least seed the Republican Party with pro-Russia views, and that inevitably paid off later with a variety of people within Trump's inner circle echoing Russia's propaganda on its invasion of Ukraine and overtly supporting the Russian war effort.     Nowhere is this more obvious than in Elon Musk and David Sacks, two of Trump's most important donors for his 2024 campaign and two of his top advisers informing his transition and administration. \[Elon Musk was personally called upon by President Putin of Russia early in the war after Ukraine was found to be using Starlink communications equipment for its war effort.\]([https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/10/28/fiona-hill-explains-trump-musk-putin-00185820](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/10/28/fiona-hill-explains-trump-musk-putin-00185820)) He \[subsequently disabled Starlink connectivity for the Ukrainian military at critical points in the war\]([https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66752264](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66752264)), influenced by Putin's view that Ukraine could not catastrophically win against the Russian occupation.     To put another bow on it, Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's nominee for Director of National Intelligence, \[has been paid and feted by Russia's state-owned media circuit as far back as 2015.\]([https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard-trump-russia.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard-trump-russia.html)) It is not clear these people want Ukraine to win the war - quite the opposite. They prefer Russia ultimately prevail.     To be clear, these people are not Russian intelligence sources or agents themselves. They likely genuinely believe what they say about Russia's position on the war for a variety of reasons -  For other folks in Trump's orbit like Gabbard, there is a mixture of plain antiwar feeling that favors Russia winning over any extended US role, as well as a sense of obligation after being so prominently boosted by Russia's state media and propaganda networks.",[deleted],2024-11-28T09:33:28,1

This is horrifically ignorant.   Hamas is not 'defeated' because it is impossible to completely eradicate an insurgency. It'll grow back. If you had done research on previous clashes with Hamas, you would know that Israel has regularly struck down militant groups in Palestine and Lebanon only for them to grow back, because it is precisely Israel's inability to pursue a long term peace in the region and solve Palestinian grievances that causes the insurgency in the first place. The US warns Israel to 'be careful' because it is a common wisdom of counterinsurgency that making the population more hostile to you just prolongs the insurgency.   This is just a very strange way to frame the conflict and I question whether you've really been following it closely enough. Even with Lebanon it is more or less unfolding exactly how Israel invaded in the late 90s/early 2000s. Some tactical military successes absent a clear endgame lead to an enduring insurgency and ultimately a build-up of Hezbollah capability once again. Most people following the region for a while have noted this, which is where rational criticism of Israel's actions come from.",[deleted],2024-11-22T17:01:09,7
"This is a superficial answer. It doesn't actually address the consequences or issues of Ukraine losing military aid versus keeping the current level it is at - the best way to have a durable ceasefire is for neither side to perceive any further gains are possible (the lack of this is why Russia has violated every ceasefire since 2014).

"I don't dislike your answer, but I think it omits that the strategic goals of the United States may not directly match the goals of the benefitting nations.

"Part Two:  **\*\*3. Conservatives, currently, have other priorities for the US defense-industrial base than Ukraine. The incoming administration's priority for the military is the deportation of legal residents and undocumented immigrants, and policing the southern border and/or sending the military into Mexico.\*\***     This is probably one of the simplest reasons. Similar to the first term in 2016, the incoming Trump administration has other priorities than worldwide conflict. The Ukraine conflict is difficult. It is going to require a lot of time and money for a stable stalemate to be achieved that allows for a lasting peace. The incoming administration has other priorities - namely deportation. \[It plans to reorient the US Defense Department and associated military for this end,\]([https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trumps-mass-deportation-plan-what-we-know-and-latest-news.html](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trumps-mass-deportation-plan-what-we-know-and-latest-news.html)) and likely \[plans to continue efforts under Trump's previous term to bomb parts of Mexico that are believed to host criminal groups.\]([https://www.forbes.com/sites/zacharysmith/2022/05/05/trump-wanted-to-secretly-launch-missiles-into-mexico-to-blow-up-drug-labs-ex-defense-secretary-reportedly-claims/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zacharysmith/2022/05/05/trump-wanted-to-secretly-launch-missiles-into-mexico-to-blow-up-drug-labs-ex-defense-secretary-reportedly-claims/))     That is going to cost a lot of time and money. The administration could fund both these efforts and Ukraine, but there is little reason to believe they have an interest in doing so, based on their first term in office. I attribute this more to an attention-span problem than anything. The top advisers to Trump are obsessed with domestic issues, namely the existence of migrant workers and perceived domestic enemies. What happens in Europe is of very little concern and beyond their attention.     \*\*4. Conservatives care about Israel for different reasons. Namely, they support a one-state solution with Israel fully controlling Palestinian territory, and the current conflict is moving towards that end.\*\*     The appointment of Mike Huckabee as Israel ambassador is a good example of what the current conservative mindset (and Trump's position) is: \[Palestinians do not exist,\]([https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/mike-huckabee-once-said-that-there-s-really-no-such-thing-as-a-palestinian/ar-AA1tYfIa?ocid=BingNewsSerp](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/mike-huckabee-once-said-that-there-s-really-no-such-thing-as-a-palestinian/ar-AA1tYfIa?ocid=BingNewsSerp)) there is no valid territory for a state of Palestine, and they would prefer if Israel merely controls the West Bank and other areas that are not under its control. Recall that under Trump's first term, he moved the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem unilaterally without consulting the Palestinian Authority, even though East Jerusalem was meant to be the capital for an eventual Palestinian state.     It's worth noting here as well the personal friendship between Israel's ruling regime and the Republican Party: \[Benjamin Netanyahu has personally addressed Congress twice at Republicans' request.\]([https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-811582](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-811582)) They even invited him in 2015 specifically to denigrate and defame the US President (Obama)'s disarmament deal with Iran at the time.     Unlike in Ukraine, which rebuffed Trump's blackmail attempt, Israel has been a willing partner to assist Republicans in their domestic political messaging. Therefore, there's some personal affinity there. The notion that Republicans should care about a supposed genocide in Gaza ignores the fact that they simply do not think it matters - their position, since 2016, is that Israel has the right to do what it is doing.",[deleted],2024-11-28T09:34:06,1
"> The question is about PULLING aid - if conservatives earnestly believe as you describe it, they're woefully ignorant of what the result would be.  As I replied in another comment, you use the threat of pulling aid to make sure Ukraine is willing to come to the table and discuss because as short as a few weeks ago Zelensky called any talk of a *ceasefire* [dangerous](https://www.barrons.com/news/zelensky-says-calls-for-ukraine-ceasefire-dangerous-irresponsible-9e59f831).  I think most of the talk about the war in Ukraine is too simplistic at best.  Two questions:  1.  Are you willing to have the United States (or the EU, etc) intervene directly in the war? 2. If no, then at the current level of support can Ukraine achieve its objectives?  If the answer to the second is also no, then you're basically just promoting a meatgrinder which, I believe, is unethical/immoral for *both* sides.

"Part Three:  **5. \\\*\\\*Conservative are somewhat naive about what pulling aid for Ukraine means.\\\*\\\***     I am going to ignore the oft-repeated ""the budget can't afford it!"" line about aid to Ukraine. The reality is the aid to Ukraine is very tiny relative to the US budget and it primarily boosts US domestic manufacturing (military aid and loans are used to ultimately buy US weapons, built in US factories, \\\[hence why Zelenskyy visited an artillery plant in Pennsylvani\\\](\[[https://www.rferl.org/a/zelenskiy-arms-plant-us/33129906.html)a\](https://www.rferl.org/a/zelenskiy-arms-plant-us/33129906.html)a](https://www.rferl.org/a/zelenskiy-arms-plant-us/33129906.html)a](https://www.rferl.org/a/zelenskiy-arms-plant-us/33129906.html)a))).     The decision to cut aid, if done, would be purely political. Likely to pressure Ukraine into conflict termination on Russia's terms. However, it's not clear how that would work, because Russia has given no indication it is ready for a lasting peace, \\\[only a ceasefire. \\\](\[[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-wants-ukraine-ceasefire-current-frontlines-sources-say-2024-05-24/)And\](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-wants-ukraine-ceasefire-current-frontlines-sources-say-2024-05-24/)And) when](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-wants-ukraine-ceasefire-current-frontlines-sources-say-2024-05-24/)And](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-wants-ukraine-ceasefire-current-frontlines-sources-say-2024-05-24/)And)%C2%A0when) Republicans \\\[previously blocked Ukrainian aid\\\](\[[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/how-stalled-u-s-aid-for-ukraine-exemplifies-gops-softening-stance-on-russia\](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/how-stalled-u-s-aid-for-ukraine-exemplifies-gops-softening-stance-on-russia)](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/how-stalled-u-s-aid-for-ukraine-exemplifies-gops-softening-stance-on-russia](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/how-stalled-u-s-aid-for-ukraine-exemplifies-gops-softening-stance-on-russia))), it only led to cascading Ukrainian military failures that led to the current predicament. There appears to be little understanding within the modern Republican Party about military strategy, or the purposes of defensive aid in the first place - the only way to pressure Russia and Ukraine to come to terms is if both sides perceive no further gains can be made, not to pull the rug out from one side of the conflict. That just encourages Russia to push harder.           Remember: The core of Russia's problem with Ukraine has not been solved yet - Russia is seeking the ethnic cleansing of Ukrainians and the Ukrainian national identity from Ukrainian land, and wants to either absorb or place a pliable client state in Kyiv. This was the basis and intent spelled out in Putin's essay \\\['On the Historical Unity of Ukrainians and Russians,\\\](\[[https://ia802207.us.archive.org/15/items/vladimir-putin-on-the-historical-unity-of-russians-and-ukrainians/Vladimir%20Putin%20-%20On%20the%20Historical%20Unity%20of%20Russians%20and%20Ukrainians.pdf\](https://ia802207.us.archive.org/15/items/vladimir-putin-on-the-historical-unity-of-russians-and-ukrainians/Vladimir%20Putin%20-%20On%20the%20Historical%20Unity%20of%20Russians%20and%20Ukrainians.pdf)](https://ia802207.us.archive.org/15/items/vladimir-putin-on-the-historical-unity-of-russians-and-ukrainians/Vladimir%20Putin%20-%20On%20the%20Historical%20Unity%20of%20Russians%20and%20Ukrainians.pdf](https://ia802207.us.archive.org/15/items/vladimir-putin-on-the-historical-unity-of-russians-and-ukrainians/Vladimir%20Putin%20-%20On%20the%20Historical%20Unity%20of%20Russians%20and%20Ukrainians.pdf)))' which was published at the onset of his invasion in 2021.     Conservatives seem to think a ceasefire would somehow hold indefinitely - despite these facts. And despite the fact that...many ceasefires have been tried before. Notably, the current war started among frontlines that had been 'frozen' around 2014, during Russia's initial invasion of Crimea and eastern Ukrainian provinces. With each step of the war, Russia has only used ceasefires to train, re-equip, and re-arm for the next invasion, which is how the 2021 invasion occurred in the first place.     A lack of understanding of this history, and perhaps willful naivete about Putin's intentions, can therefore explain some conservative reasoning. On the flip side, with Israel, conservatives are rooting for the opposite of a ceasefire - they believe conflict termination can occur on Israel's terms, despite the evidence from 20+ years of insurgency in Iraq and Afghanistan that spell out what happens when a threadbare military attempts to occupy hostile populations.  That could also be from a lack of history or willful ignorance, it's not clear.     Hope this helps clarify some things!",[deleted],2024-11-28T09:34:33,1
"Doesn't make much sense. The only reason Russia would rescope war goals and enter ceasefire negotiations is if it perceived it cannot make anymore gains. By pulling aid or even showing weakness in front of Putin, it just guarantees they'll push for more territory and prolong the suffering. Your logic is entirely backward and not in step with movements on the ground - the greatest gains made by Russia all occurred during the previous blockage in aid set up by Republicans in the House.  >But Russians are the aggressors so I don't think they really care (its Russia's war strategy since, well, the entirety of the modern era) but we're supposed to be the good, enlightened people, right?  If you're stating Russians will just mindlessly keep grinding themselves against Ukrainian trenches because they're 'evil' and 'aggressive' then I'd say that's horribly racist and doesn't reflect the reality on the Russian side. There is exhaustion in the Russian armed forces. The arrival of North Korean troops proves that. If the Ukrainians want to keep fighting, then the alternative is to force Russia to the table for talks, not Ukraine.

"Your understanding of the situation is incorrect. More Ukrainians die without aid. With military aid, air defenses, ground defenses, and the frontline in general is much more stable.  Much better and more enduring to set Ukraine up for a while to bargain for a lasting peace - otherwise, Russia will merely accelerate gains and ethnic cleansing, or use the ceasefire as an excuse to rearm.   If you have a long enough memory, the history of the conflict since 2014 should tell you this. This is why when people erroneously state pulling aid helps Ukraine, I find it naive.",[deleted],2024-11-22T17:03:43,2
