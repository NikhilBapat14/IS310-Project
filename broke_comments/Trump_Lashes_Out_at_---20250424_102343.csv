">‚ÄúRupert Murdoch has told me for years that he is going to get rid of his FoxNews, Trump Hating, Fake Pollster, but he has never done so.‚Äù  Honestly, it's just... shocking how deeply entrenched this is.

"> The new Fox News poll found that Trump‚Äôs highest approval rating is on border security, with 55% approval. But as Fox News noted, that is the only issue where his ratings are in positive territory: ‚ÄúOn immigration, a record high of 47% approve of Trump (48% disapprove), while a new low of 38% approve on the economy (56% disapprove),‚Äù according to the outlet‚Äôs article about the poll. The president‚Äôs worst ratings are on inflation (33% approve, 59% disapprove), followed by tariffs (33%-58%), foreign policy (40%-54%), taxes (38%-53%), and guns (41%-44%). >  > In addition, per the Fox News poll, Elon Musk‚Äôs work with Trump on DOGE was firmly negative, with 39% of Americans approving and 56% disapproving. >  > The Fox News survey was fielded April 18-21, 2025, with a 1,104 registered U.S. voters ‚Äúunder the direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R),‚Äù the outlet said.

"Polls are only as good as the people conducting them. I don't know what poll you're talking about referring to violence, but that's kind of an oddball thing to ask and guessing it wasn't the most reputable poll (though I am not sure).   But as far as samples go, 1k is a generally pretty decent sample, for a good/reputable pollster. As you can imagine the results you actually see are not just the raw data, because you'd have to just luck into a representative sample by coincidence. Instead they probe the demographics of the people polled, and demographics of the larger populous, and weight results based on who answered.   It's still not perfect by any means. All polls have a margin of error, which is also estimated by the pollster based again on who actually responded. But 1k+ is typically enough for a good pollster to have some results that make sense.   And again want to stress they're never perfect, and also attitudes shift by the day and by the week so even at best a poll is like a snapshot of the ""vibes"" at the time the poll was taken. And notoriously polls are not very ""quick"" to capture trends -- the ""vibes"" in a poll tend to lag behind by at least a week or more.",SirDiego,2025-04-24T11:13:43,5

"With polls and sample sizes, there is a point where adding thousands of more respondents won't significantly change anything.    Think of it like flipping a coin, it should work out to 50/50 odds of it being either heads or tails.  If you only flip the coin 4 times, maybe it comes up heads 3 times and tails 1 time.  If you flip that coin 100 times, it will be right around 50 heads and 50 tails, say 52 heads and 48 tails.  Now do it 900 more times for 1000 total flips and it will be really close to 50/50.  Do you need to flip the coin 9000 more times to see if it's actually 50/50 or would something like 505 to 495 let you say that the chances of flipping a coin are probably 50/50.  That's how sample sizes work.  They need to be large enough to be representative of the population, which for nation wide polling (in a lot of circumstances and assuming the population is representative) is around 1000.  Need more people if you are looking to drill down further or further classify how certain groups feel about the question you're asking.",UsedToHaveThisName,2025-04-24T11:28:28,15

"The only way to know if a sample is large enough ‚Äúat first glance‚Äù is to have it memorized. A sample size of 1000 gives an MoE of about 3% at 95% confidence given an infinite population size. That‚Äôs plenty small enough given how negative Trump‚Äôs net approval is, particularly when you have dozens of polls all saying the same thing for weeks.",gurenkagurenda,2025-04-24T15:34:54,1

"Statistical methodology can make for fairly accurate representative polling.  The math can be quite accurate for reputable pollsters.
