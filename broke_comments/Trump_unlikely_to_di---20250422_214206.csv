">Trump said he had Hegseth’s back and voiced frustration at “leakers”  So dangerous negligence and incompetence are acceptable at the highest levels of the U.S. Dept. of Defense, says the 'commander in chief', but the main thing is that the American people not know about the fuck ups??",dremonearm,2025-04-22T21:59:11,15

"<reporter>: Mr. President! Mr. President!     <Trump>: If you want me to call on you, what's the magic word?     <reporter>: *(sigh)* - Mr. Most Excellent Supreme Being President, given the controversy and confusion - along with the misuse of a banned app to share military secrets with civilians, as well as possibly the Kremlin - are you considering dismissing Pete Hegseth, your Sec Def?     <Trump>: All options are on the table, Trump is as open-minded as he is brilliant! Many people are saying so - I wouldn't say it myself because I'm so humble, despite being so magnificent.  But if there was some reason for me to dismiss my secretary don't you think there would be some sort of reporting on it in the fake news? Next question ...",84thPrblm,2025-04-22T22:14:56,2
