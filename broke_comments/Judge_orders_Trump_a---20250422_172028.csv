"This was another blatant attempt from the Trump administration to not just overstep congressional authority, but to gain control over the spread of information and to stifle the free press. And of course they justified it by claiming that services like the VOA promote ""left-wing propaganda,"" and don't ""adequately represent America's interests.""   In reality however, the VOA is considered one of the most accurate and objective sources of news because it operates under a ""firewall"" that is supposed to ensure editorial independence, and as stipulated by the VOA charter which was signed into law by Gerald Ford.  The charter basically requires integrity in reporting.  The goal for the Trump administration isn't just to threaten and defund independent journalism, but to also assert its political influence and control over VOA's content.  Targeting its operation could heavily restrict the VOA's ability to combat misinformation in other countries as well. Hmm, I wonder how this could benefit the Trump administration?  in case you aren't aware, VOA broadcasts largely to international audiences and it reaches hundreds of millions of people weekly across multiple platforms.  They also provide news to places where free press is limited or non-existent.   Over 80% of VOA's audience reports that they find its content trustworthy.  This is also an attempt from the Trump administration to target diversity in news coverage as the VOA provides news and information in 48 different languages worldwide, and its primary audience is non-american.  The funding for VOA comes from Congress, which means Trump is clearly overstepping congressional authority and ignoring the separation of powers. But judging by Trump's response to court orders recently, it's unlikely that his administration or his kowtowing loyalists in Congress will adhere strictly to this order.",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-04-22T19:01:59,24

"It's about time the courts start hammering tRump and he band of idiots on their illegal acts. USAGM had no lawful right to do what they did. They just followed tRumps orders without thinking about it. Now that the Judge has ordered VOA to be completely restored, they had better do as he ordered or find themselves in front of the Judge.... They most likely wont like what he does next.....",Harry_Mud,2025-04-22T17:44:40,16

"tRump himself didn't do anything. The Judge ordered USAGM to do as he ordered. tRump unlawfully was trying to get rid of VOA for whatever reason and it was very illegal for USAGM to do as he wanted.

"VOA is a big deal in building bridges in other countries. It’s part of the plan to wall us off from everyone else and alienate our allies. It’s the same reason he pulled us out of WHO and stopped all the AIDS drugs going to Africa. He’s doing the bidding of his masters who want America alone and friendless. It’s why he never has reasons other than “costs too much, unfair nasty people, they weren’t working hard enough”. He doesn’t know or care the real reason, he’s middle management.",myfakesecretaccount,2025-04-22T17:59:32,8
