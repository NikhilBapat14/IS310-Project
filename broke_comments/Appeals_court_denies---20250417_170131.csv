El Salvador still has to agree to extradite him. They don‚Äôt care what a US Appeals Court rules.,Lifeisagreatteacher,2025-04-17T17:04:32,257

"He's a Salvadoran, not an American. And El Salvador is not fucking around with gang members right now. No way in hell he ever sees American soil again.",VeryPokey,2025-04-17T18:33:20,42
"Even if he‚Äôs sent back here, they‚Äôll just retain him in custody then deport him right back lol.",BH11B,2025-04-17T19:13:25,33
It‚Äôs ridiculous this is continuing after the President of El Salvador explicitly said he‚Äôs not going to be released. The Supreme Court should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this farce to continue. If Trump is remembered for anything it should be exposing corruption. The judicial branch is a joke.,FkDemocRats2024,2025-04-17T17:07:28,5

"Honestly, I wouldn't expect them to agree to blocking the return.    On the other hand, don't forget the SCOTUS ruling admonished the lower courts against overstepping into the Executive's powers.  The El Salvador president has already said that returning him is off the table.  How much effort should be expended and at what price is in those powers.    I've said before, this doesn't end well for the judicial branch.  And it just may give Trump a bigger margin in Congress.",Celebril63,2025-04-17T18:37:37,3

"I dont get why our courts just didn't order the return of the Americans who became prisoners in North Korea and Russia, it was so simple all along.",AnnoyingInternetTrol,2025-04-17T21:31:18,82
Agreed. I don‚Äôt think the lower US courts understand the problem here with their stance. They can‚Äôt force a foreign country to do anything. They have no power over El Salvador or its government. So‚Ä¶. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,ITrCool,2025-04-17T20:15:30,12
"Following in Reagan's footsteps, unfortunately. Giving millions of illegal immigrants amnesty was the lowest point of his admin, which is saying a lot considering the Iran-Contra affair also took place.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-17T17:53:48,40

"Even that would *at least* be rational.   Because the Americans in north Korea or Russia are actually, ya know, *American citizens*. So maybe the courts do have a little bit of say.   This guy is El Salvadorean. They're asking his government to release their own citizen. This is as fucking dumb as an appeals court ordering Kim Jong Un to release *his own North Korean citizens from jail*.   Apparently it was all that easy all along.",funny_flamethrower,2025-04-18T02:26:11,10
