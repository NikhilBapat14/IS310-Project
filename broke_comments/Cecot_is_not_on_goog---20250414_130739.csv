"If you know where it is, go make a bounding box around it on geojson.io website. Save it. Then you can use this geojson files to query other satellites. Europe has the biggest publicly funded remote sensing program in the world. A Sentinel 2 sstellite should fly over that area every week and you can fetch it with that geojson. Europe won't be censoring anything.   It won't be as high resolution as the Google map ones (1 meter vs. 10 meters pr pixel) but the Google earth ones are basemaps that can be several years old.  With S2 you get a fresh one ca. Once a week. For free.  You can likely find the images without coding on sentinelhub.   If you are willing to pay a little, you can get 3 meter resolution daily from www.planet.com.  American company, but I have not seen them censor anything",Mars_target,2025-04-14T13:17:39,31
"The coordinates to CECOT on google earth: 13¬∞32'04.4""N 88¬∞48'19.9""W  Some additional context on El Salvadoran Prison human rights violations: [https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/03/20/human-rights-watch-declaration-prison-conditions-el-salvador-jgg-v-trump-case](https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/03/20/human-rights-watch-declaration-prison-conditions-el-salvador-jgg-v-trump-case)  3.  The Salvadoran government has described people held in CECOT as ‚Äúterrorists,‚Äù and has said that **they ‚Äúwill never leave.‚Äù** Human Rights Watch is **not aware of any detainees who have been released** from that prison. The government of El Salvador denies human rights groups access to its prisons and has only allowed journalists and social media influencers to visit CECOT under highly controlled circumstances.  4. While CECOT is likely to have more modern technology and infrastructure than other prisons in El Salvador, I understand the mistreatment of detainees there to be in large part similar to what Human Rights Watch has documented in other prisons in El Salvador, including Izalco, La Esperanza (Mariona) and Santa Ana prisons. This includes **cases of torture, ill-treatment, incommunicado detention, severe violations of due process and inhumane conditions, such as lack of access to adequate healthcare and food**.  8. One of the people we spoke with was an 18-year-old construction worker who said that **police beat prison newcomers with batons for an hour**. He said that when he denied being a gang member, they sent him to a **dark basement cell with 320 detainees, where prison guards and other detainees beat him every day. On one occasion, one guard beat him so severely that it broke a rib**.  12. For ‚ÄúWe Can Arrest Anyone,‚Äù Human Rights Watch and Cristosal gathered evidence of over 240 cases of people detained in prisons in El Salvador with underlying health conditions, including diabetes, recent history of stroke, and meningitis. Former detainees often describe filthy and disease-ridden prisons. **Doctors who visited detention sites told us that tuberculosis, fungal infections, scabies, severe malnutrition and chronic digestive issues were common.**  13. Out of the **estimated 350 detainees who have died in El Salvador‚Äôs prisons,** we documented 11 of these cases in detail in ‚ÄúWe Can Arrest Anyone‚Äù, based on interviews with victims‚Äô relatives, medical records, analysis by forensic experts, and other evidence.  14. ***In one case, a person who died in custody was buried in a mass grave, without the family's knowledge.*** This practice could amount to an¬†enforced disappearance¬†if authorities intentionally concealed the fate or whereabouts of the detainee.  16. In at least four of the eleven \[death\] cases, photographs of the bodies show bruises. Members of the Independent Forensic Expert Group (IFEG) of the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims (IRCT), who reviewed the photos and other evidence in two of the cases, told Human Rights Watch and Cristosal that t**he deaths were ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù given that the bodies ‚Äúpresent multiple lesions that show trauma that could have been caused by torture or ill-treatment that might have contributed to their deaths while in custody.**‚Äù  17. In a separate Human Rights Watch report from February 2020, titled ‚ÄúDeported to Danger,‚Äù Human Rights Watch investigated and reported on the conditions in Salvadoran prisons experienced by Salvadoran nationals deported by the United States.\[3\] In interviews with deportees and their relatives or friends, we collected accounts of **three male deportees from the United States who said they were beaten by police or soldiers during arrest, followed by beatings during their time in custody, which lasted between three days to over a year**. During their time in prison, two of these individuals reported being kicked in the face and testicles. ***A third man described being kicked by guards in his neck and abdomen, after which he sustained injuries requiring an operation for a ruptured pancreas and spleen, month-long hospitalization, and 60 days of post-release treatment***.",ververvava,2025-04-14T15:48:37,19

"I know as an American I cannot fully grasp the horrors you have witnessed and I am so sorry you and your loved ones have had to experience the horrors you have. I am no expert but I know that in the 80s the US government intentionally destabilized El Salvador and sent soldiers that raped/killed countless innocent people and added to the gang violence. In my opinion (at the VERY LEAST) the US should fund healthcare and education for all US and Salvadorian citizens but Trump would call me an extremist liberal marxist for that opinion and would send me to CECOT if he could lol. It bothers me so much that rich men don't pay taxes so they can buy their 3rd/4th/5th yacht when innocent children are sick and starving.   I know the Bukele has high approval ratings because he reduced the gang violence and I totally understand wanting to be safe. One thing I think about a lot is if the government kills someone it's not murder it's ""just"" killing/death. If someone is killed in the prison it is not recorded as murder, it's recorded as death or an accident if recorded at all. Same with military operations, it is never called ""murder"". I am concerned about how Bukele calls himself the ""coolest dictator in the world"" and how his ""new ideas"" party has taken over all branches of government and he defied the constitution running for a second term and will not lift the state of emergency even though its been two years. From what I can tell, Trump is trying to be a shitty knock-off version of Bukele but Trump is much MUCH stupider and certainly less cool and less loved because trump hasn't really done anything to truly protect anyone besides billionaires... The average American has not been a victim of gangs/terrorism so Trump is trying to use CECOT footage to make US citizens scared that they COULD be hurt and these gang members are HIDING in America. Really at the end of the day Trump is banking on racism to create enough fear in combination with the CECOT press/influencer media.   My friend is Salvadoran and his mom ran away and gave birth to him in America so he is a US citizen but he left America to be in El Salvador with his grandma because racist tensions are so high here he does not feel safe, especially since he has tattoos. He is very concerned about Bukele disappearing Salvadoran citizens who have tattoos and since the state of emergency is not lifted he has no rights which is scary. He told me yesterday that he avoids the city and feels safe in the country. He said a few months ago his uncle (who has no gang affiliations) has been in taken El Salvador to a prison in the middle of a municipal waste center with no light entering and they cannot contact him but the government says he is still alive with 500 other inmates. He said when he was dropping off food he saw them bringing in American el Salvadoran prisoners that were speaking english which he had never seen before.   He said Bukele is gentrifying the nation and kicking out Salvadorans and incarcerating them so tech bros and investors can overtake the country. He said that the average Salvadoran makes $150 a month but rent is no less than $250. He said when he goes into the city he keeps seeing more and more American and Arab investors and is very upset.   I totally agree with you there is NO reason trump should be deporting people to these CECOT prisons. In America the ICE prisons are contracted with private for-profit prisons so when ICE kidnaps and detains immigrants, the more people grabbed and the longer they are held the more taxpayer money the private prisons get. Additionally, all politicians with stocks in these companies get richer the more immigrants taken and detained. It's horrible!! I'm SO ANGRY my taxes are going to this kind of US terrorism against innocent immigrants!! America is a country of immigrants and all these white people are immigrants too!! It makes me so mad that the rich seem to never get punished and it's basically a crime to be poor.

"Don't worry, I never expect privileged people to understand these matters. Thinking mareros deserve humane treatment makes it obvious you have never interacted with mass murderers on a regular basis.  ***EDIT: Since i can't respond to*** u/BusiniessAioli\*\*\*'s comment, here is my reply:\*\*\*  >People are being sent to this prison based on assumptions and without a trial. Imagine if someone mistook you for a gang member?¬†  I take it we are correctly ignoring US detainees which have no business being sent to cecot.  You can't mistake people for gang members. They all have maras tattoos. A requirement for joining a gang is the murder of a random citizen or rival marero, or a rape, usually of a rival marero's GF, followed by her public, broadcasted execution and spreading of body parts somewhere in town. Before turning 15 years old I passed by at the very least 5 different ''women dismembered in trash bags on a roundabout'' scenarios, and I lived in a part considered ''safe''.  We tried everything before this. You know what we got when trying to have fair trials for mareros? Mass murders. Last time there were even ***talks*** about cracking down on maras related crime, they murdered almost 90 people in 2 days.  The time before that, they took a bus full of people, burned it with them alive, inside, in broad daylight on a street crossing, filled it with bullets from all angles and prevented crews from cleaning it up for a whole week.  ***There is no way to reason or negotiate with a group of people that had effectively created a secondary government body to opress 6 million citizens.***  >what if 10 years from now, they take your son or grandson to this prison on the inaccurate assumption that they were gang members?  No tattoo artist in LATAM will give you a maras tattoo unknowingly.  >Ending violence with more violence just creates more pain, and eventually the injustice will touch your life, too. You aren't responsible for gang members and the pain they cause, but you will be responsible for this.  I sleep well at night.  My people are now safe to roam the streets.  My 80yo grandma is able to walk down the store without paying renta.  Kids can visit libraries without paying to a homeboy at the entrance.  San Salvador's center is now somewhere people can visit without wondering if they'll get stabbed in broad daylight.  I was able to visit my country for the first time after 15+ years living on the other side of the world.  I know it's very hard for a privileged person born in a developed country to understand what it's like to  live in a country that was effectively a war zone for 30+ years, where 10 year olds walking by crime scenes of several women dismembered and in trash bags in a city's roundabout was a common enough occurrence to not even warrant commentary from people passing by.  If you want to call us criminals for locking up the 20k or so mareros that were opressing the 6million or so salvadoreans in our country, go right ahead, we'll take the tag while being able to live normal lives for the first time in 30 years. We are now amongst the safest countries ***in the world.***  EDIT: for u/chefk85, as the replies are still broken  >This is brought up because our orange dictator is now sending us citizens  Again, we agree on this. The US should solve it's own issues and stop relying on central and southamerica as the dumping grounds for criminals or alleged criminals. That's actually how we got the Maras in the first place, they were excons that interacted with the, at the time, more organized mexican cartel and west/east coast african american gangs in US prisons. I personally have no idea what's the endgame for the political play Bukele is trying to pull off, maybe it's just a matter of getting more funds for the country because the maras provided a \*\*\*stupidly\*\*\* large economy to huge swaths of the country, dirty money or not, it was money flowing that doesn't exist anymore and has to be built slowly.  CECOT and lack of due process was never meant for ''normal'' criminals. You have to understand \*every single marero\* has their crimes, alleigances and even specific murders ''beautifully'' inked into their bodies. You don't need due process to lock up a guy with MS on their forehead, that tattoo alone is the confession of the crime needed to join the gang.  Orange man should stop sending them here, for sure.     EDIT: for u/Codi_BAsh",drkztan,2025-04-16T12:50:32,1
">So, since the prison has been used I assume you've no longer had issues with gangs?  >Or maybe cruelty does absolutely jack shit to solve the issue except for satisfying sadists like you.  Yeah, virtually no gang issues now! We are now the safest country in LATAM and amongst the safest countries in the world!  My 80yo grandmother stopped paying renta when she wanted to go to the store, my cousins are playing on the streets again. The city center is actually a place people visit without fearing for their lives now. A huge library was built and no mareros charge you for entering it.  I was able to visit my country for the first time in 15+ years and we are pretty much the safest country in continental america at the moment, and I'm actually looking to purchase back our old family home to move back in.",drkztan,2025-04-16T23:18:34,1
