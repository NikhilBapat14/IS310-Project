"Meh, ""smart"" people can misjudge people. Or lie and say they think he's smart in public, because they know they gotta keep the ruse up. Hell, the stupidity of the average person actually makes it more likely to misjudge his intelligence. A person doesn't need to be dumber than another to think the other is smart, they just need to be dumb enough to not know what constitutes intelligence. And intelligence is not necessary for success.  I don't think half of people think he's smart by any means. Maybe 25%. The rest are either just on the MAGA train for their own self centered reasons and are willing to pretend the emperor has clothes. And of course MAGA doesn't hold a monopoly on stupid.
