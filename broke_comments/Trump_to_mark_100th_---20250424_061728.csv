Between rallies and golf one would think he would be away from the office enough not to screw things up.  Nope he is very efficient when it comes to screwing up,HippieJed,2025-04-24T06:50:17,14
"Who in their right mind would go to a Trump rally ? Is it outside? Well… I hope any patriots that might attend behave themselves. I hope no riots break out, hope nobody gets shot.",New-Cupcake4479,2025-04-24T07:27:12,12
These Rallies are to sell merch and nothing more. He doesn't need to rally and technically he can't run again.,The_Establishmnt,2025-04-24T07:53:54,7
What a great opportunity for the American people to let him know what we think of the job he’s done so far…,LLGaverageoldlady,2025-04-24T09:59:42,7

"Why does Whitmer even support penalties on imports, and why isn't the Michigan Democratic Party mobilizing Macomb County? Trump and Republicans have been hammering Macomb County, and telling them what they want to hear. Democrats need to make at least as much of an effort here, and step up their ground game in Macomb, Monroe, Bay, Eaton, and Manistee counties.",x_xHaunter313,2025-04-24T09:52:56,4

Rally for what?,KR1735,2025-04-24T09:23:42,3
Everyone should protest by not showing up. It would be amazing. Him talking to an empty space. It would trigger him so badly. Spoiled brat.,amywhatsherface,2025-04-24T10:14:53,3

Ah yes of course he needs his little army of lobotomised sheep to bleat for him to stroke his ego how am I not surprised.,Deviantdefective,2025-04-24T12:23:31,2
"I hear his rallies are very dangerous. Felons walking around openly, gunfire all over the place. ",takethemoment13,2025-04-24T21:26:16,2
"People need to be able to afford to live, which often includes having a job. A rally isn't going to pay their bills.   Plus, how much is this going to cost the taxpayers?    ""We’re already seeing the impacts. Auto companies are stockpiling parts and laying off workers. Suppliers are facing higher costs and delaying expansions. Dealerships will be forced to raise prices by up to $15,000 amid slowing sales. And since every auto job supports three others in the community, the impact will be felt by countless small businesses across Michigan, too,"" she said.",Lebarican22,2025-04-24T06:19:10,2
He’s a malignant narcissist who needs constant adoration and praise. He’s destroying our country solely for the sake of his ego.,Significant_Camp9024,2025-04-24T07:29:57,31
He never stopped campaigning since 2016! Ten years of this pig,Cluefuljewel,2025-04-24T09:09:09,11

He might be looking (hoping?) for a riot.,moreobviousthings,2025-04-24T06:43:44,13

Are those hats commemorating the year of his death?,Haaskivi,2025-04-24T16:14:07,1
"Honestly if he had campaigned and governed like what used to pass for a normal republican like the last two republican candidates for president McCain and Romney, he would have been wildly popular. I never knew he was this stupid uninformed messianic authoritarian pussy grabbing freak!  I mean he always had the womanizer and braggart persona. That much  we always knew. We did not know he was a pathological liar, had a reputation of refusing to pay contractors, cheating at golf, sexually assaulting dozens of women, admiration for dictators. No way. He was known as a popular tv star and business man to the general public.",Cluefuljewel,2025-04-24T10:05:59,3
