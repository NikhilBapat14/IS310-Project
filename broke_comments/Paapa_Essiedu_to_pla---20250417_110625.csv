I'm still waiting for someone to cast Jim Carrey as Ghandi in a remake of the 1982 film.,Ironman650,2025-04-17T11:11:05,27
That‚Äôs okay with me as long as they cast Peter Dinklage as Hagrid.,murmanator,2025-04-17T11:21:13,43
"Had to click the article to confirm this wasn‚Äôt BabylonBee. Sure enough, the ultra-woke UK is absolutely race-swapping another white character. Yet again.",Achmetan,2025-04-17T11:09:39,51
"Lol I don't even care anymore, the race swapping is getting to be pretty comical at this point.   They should have made it an animated series instead.",-Throw_Away_16-,2025-04-17T16:19:59,5
Such an unnecessary remake,aethiestinafoxhole,2025-04-17T12:38:44,17
"The thing is, making Snape black makes Harry's parents and their friends (and pretty much everyone else at the school) into Grand Wizard racists!",Derek-Ess,2025-04-17T13:26:28,18
"Here, a [preview](https://preview.redd.it/leaked-scene-from-the-new-harry-potter-series-v0-inqmmnngm5oe1.jpeg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=0befe9f73ab9d27d39df997c6dba5977db23cb85) of the show.",2696969,2025-04-17T11:14:07,9
"Honestly don't really care unless it's a sign of things to come. At least they got the age right. Alan Rickman did fantastic, but he was waaaayyyyy too old. Snape is only 31/32 in Philosopher's Stone.",Zaphenzo,2025-04-17T11:27:48,2
"Its ok, no real fan of HP was planning to watch this abomination anyway",Xander_hades_,2025-04-18T09:07:11,1
And *I'm* still waiting for the Shaft remake with Michael Cera as Shaft.,sowellpatrol,2025-04-18T02:15:53,2
I wanna see Jeff Goldblum as Dobby,GaggleOfGibbons,2025-04-17T11:54:41,16
>Hagrid  Nick Frost.  I'm not kidding.  I'm actually...  ok with that maybe?  John Lithgow as Dumbledore?  lol - I can't even see this in my head.  I adore Lithgow...  Dumbledore though?,bozoconnors,2025-04-17T12:12:23,0
"I don't know, it could work if the actor has the right personality and acting abilities.   I was quite surprised with how good Will Smith was as Genie in the Aladdin remake.   ü§∑",Ironman650,2025-04-17T11:13:23,-29
I lol'd entirely too hard at that.,bozoconnors,2025-04-17T12:11:47,4
‚ÄúDonny is‚Ä¶ a free Elf.‚Äù *hand gesture*,jak2125,2025-04-17T11:57:04,13
I don‚Äôt think Genie was race swapped. MF was still blue,Florida__Man__,2025-04-17T12:22:25,45
"It won't work for multiple reasons.   Snape is established as having pale skin and greasy long black hair.   It's gonna look pretty shitty when Harry intrinsically distrusts the one black teacher and constantly accused him of wrongdoing.   It's gonna look pretty shitty when James and Sirius bully the one black kid ""more for the fact that he exists.""   It's gonna be sketchy when the one black kid joins the wizard gang.   There are many other characters where race wouldn't matter one bit, even Dumbledore would be fine TBH.",Mountain_Man_88,2025-04-17T14:23:43,15
"Well sure the actor may be great for all we know, at the end of the day people shouldn't attack the actor for just taking a role that pays the bills, the fault really lies in the casting director. Daniel day lewis is one of the most prolific actors of all time, but you're not gonna see him get cast as a role that was previously established as a black man.",just_one_random_guy,2025-04-17T11:46:21,13
Me too. I clicked because of your comment and was not disappointed.,sowellpatrol,2025-04-18T02:17:57,2
