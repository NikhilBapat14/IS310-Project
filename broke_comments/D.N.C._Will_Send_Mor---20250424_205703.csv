"Never gonna happen. I watched a super moderate, veteran, well spoken man who truly cared about the people and visited every corner of the state lose in a landslide to a dude who visits Missouri once every few years. Kunce and Hawley are who I’m referring to. It is what it is at this point. We are so polarized that people don’t care about actual candidates or policies.",TDeath21,2025-04-24T21:00:35,1
Imagine where we could have been if the DNC hadn't kicked Howard Dean to the curb. Only took them damn near 20 years to figure this shit out.,1900grs,2025-04-24T20:58:52,1

"As much as I shit on the DNC for being reactionary centrist hacks, this is actually a good move.  Post New Deal Democrats (from 76-present) neglected state legislature so badly. It allowed the gerrymandering to get worse and worse and this is the first of many steps to turning that page.  Democrats used to dominate state legislature. There's currently about 4,100 Republicans in state legislative seats to about 3,200 Democrats. Chip away in the state houses for the long term projects.  The GOP motivates their base across consistent ideological points with local flavor sprinkled on top. Democrats need to recapture the message that local government affects people the most, focus on statehouses and start peeling back control from the GOP.",Pike_Gordon,2025-04-24T21:11:16,1

"Just give these yokels the money directly, with ""Paid for by Democrats"" on the check. These morons say they care about fraud, waste, and lazy dems but they were the ones cheering trump for wanting to print his name on checks for them to stay home during covid. They're the ones buying beer and cigarettes on the first of the month with their EBT cards. Just like everything with them, every accusation is a confession. They only care about being handed a free ride. Give them one and then harp on it endlessly. ",Sick_Wave_,2025-04-24T21:19:24,1
"It doesn't matter. The DNC will only allow old geriatric centrists bought with donors dollars to advance past any primary, and they will continue to lose to the more established right wing Republicans.  Until there is a real choice in America, red states will continue to choose Republicans and our democracy will burn for it.",Trump_sucks_d,2025-04-24T21:04:04,1
Every state has the potential to be a blue state.     Reagan once got every state but one!  No reason why democrats can’t achieve that same feat.,dbag3o1,2025-04-24T21:57:57,1

"Agreed. The Democrats are facing a monumental task to undo 50 years of listlessness.  I read a good book last week called Chaotic Neutral by Ed Burmilla, an unabashed progressive, but talented political historian tracing the shift of the party from being a stalwart for the working class to being the baroque lifestyle branding it's become.  A large portion is focused on how Democrats dominated statehouses into the 90s and how the gerrymandering of 2000 and 2010 from state legislature slimmed down Democratic national chances to gain consistent majorities.  He also goes into the way that the Republican party is able to consistently message their party platform at the localest of local levels (think about insane school board members) all the way to the white house. And how Democrats haven't responded to this shift for 20 years and it detached people from the national party. I don't agree with all his points necessarily but overall I highly recommend it.",Pike_Gordon,2025-04-24T21:22:36,1
"And that was at a time when there were tons of actual swing voters and split ticket voters. Bush also tried to privatize Social Security in 2005 and got huge backlash for it and the unpopularity of the Iraq Invasion had come to light. It was a perfect storm of everything, none of which the Democrats actually did. The cherry on top of course was the most well spoken, articulate, and charismatic candidate fell right into the Democrats lap when Obama decided to run for President earlier than expected and shot up the primary polls seemingly out of nowhere to snag the nomination.",TDeath21,2025-04-24T21:48:38,1
