"This whole thing makes zero sense. Had the tariff policies never been introduced, inflation wouldn't have increased. Therefore, the Fed would have cut interest rates and the economy would be on track for a smoother landing. Then he could have slowly negotiated more fair trade deals one by one.",Readysteady2025,2025-04-22T18:09:20,3
"if he had just done nothing he'd be able to ride what was the best economy in the world and claim victory.  Just like Covid.    Instead, just like covid, magical thinking is not solving the problem... the markets won't stop divesting just because he wants them to, just like covid won't magically disappear one day.  The more he shows to be chaotic the more the bond market will falter too.    I don't see how this economic downturn stems until the administration is at a minimum heavily reined in by congress.  The administration is the sole cause of the situation, what else is there to fix?",Late-Dingo-8567,2025-04-22T18:33:26,4

Someone reminded him for probably the 40th time that most of his personal assets are in US dollars and deliberately destroying confidence in the Fed is probably not in his interest.,smersh101,2025-04-22T17:51:02,3
"Translation: He'll be out by Friday, April 25th. The story will most likely break late Friday afternoon, moments after the closing bell. I'm going to watch those after-market stocks tank, and I'm keeping my fingers crossed for the opening bell on Monday. Stomach churning times indeed.",According-Pay-7075,2025-04-22T18:04:18,3
"Yeah, I don't believe that. The guy lies constantly.",jayfeather31,2025-04-22T18:24:40,3
shows someone got through his tick skull this would be a very bad move; still think he's going to pull that trigger.,roastbeeftacohat,2025-04-22T17:34:49,1

Daddy Trump got slapped by Grampa because Grampa's retirement portfolio is hurting too much.,lonelytop1818,2025-04-23T03:03:09,1
I think he's getting tired of all that winning,RAdm_Teabag,2025-04-23T05:37:56,1
"Yeah!  So if y'all could stop applying political pressure and bringing it up during interviews, so that he could quietly regroup and find a way to fire him anyway, that'd be great. s/",pjwalen,2025-04-23T10:10:02,1

He is addicted to confusion,SirPonderer,2025-04-22T17:36:03,13
"""If I want him gone he'll be gone, believe me"".  What this new quote really means is he found out he can't do it and he wants to make it seem like it's not happening because he hasn't made it so.",UncomfyPerspective,2025-04-22T18:21:08,11
"I assume when he said termination he meant end of term, but u can never know for sure",rmdavidov,2025-04-22T17:49:41,0
That would require a brain cell and Trump to put down social media long enough to have a reasonable articulate thought.,lonelytop1818,2025-04-23T03:05:49,2

Precisely!,Catymandoo,2025-04-22T17:39:00,3
Sorry if I didn't write it clearly enough. I meant to imply that trump meant to say end of term instead of termination. But because he is illiterate he used the wrong word.,rmdavidov,2025-04-22T20:32:00,3
