"I hate the idea of a healthy, popular, and effective candidate getting rejected because of an arbitrary line. It's up to us as voters to make those determinations. That's democracy.   The problem is we seem to have a lack of viable candidates and/or little choice to vote for them. I think that's a much deeper and systemic problem.

"No, I don't feel there should be a maximum age, but there should be term limits for those offices that don't currently have them (e.g. the House and Senate in the US).  Free and fair elections allow the people to decide whether an older person is fit for the office.  What could be done is to implement a mechanism for a vote of no confidence, so those that are not serving the will of the voters, or who are no longer competent enough to perform the duties of their office, can be removed and replaced.",ANewBeginningNow,2025-04-08T16:52:05,2

"Yes! A mandatory retirement age (MRA) is something I absolutely think should apply to politicians!! However, I don’t think it should be static.  *Disclaimer: I’m not sold on numbers, I’m selling a concept. If you like the idea, awesome! If you disagree with the numbers, that’s totally valid!*  ——  ## Core Concept     The MRD for politicians should be 85% the average life expectancy of a citizen. Currently that’s about 77.5 which would put the MRA at about 66 years old.  ——  ## Supporting Details     So when does it matter? The obvious start is that you can’t run if you’re over the MRA. Maybe you can’t run if you’d be over the MRA by the end of your term. I’m open to discussion about either.  Now for the tricky part. When does the MRA remove you? Maybe your seat goes up for election when you reach the MRA. Maybe it can’t remove you, just prevent you from running. I’m open to many ideas here.  ——  ## General Thoughts     I feel this is a smart avenue because it encourages politicians to work on national health. We could maybe expand on this concept by somehow incentivizing a lowering of the retirement age. I don’t think wrapping up too many metrics is a good idea, but those two feel related and important.  I’m a believer in crafting an environment to set you up for success. This is an opportunity for passive measures to be used to influence politicians on the people’s behalf.",Arkmer,2025-04-08T08:33:53,1
"You know, I'm starting to think that as a person gets older they should actually have less influence on politics. Why should someone with 5 years left to live have all that much influence on what's going to happen in the next 50?  Maybe the further you get over the median age for voters in the country the smaller percentage your vote counts. Like, if you're close to the end you get 50% of a vote.

"Its a good question.  Is being the president the equivelant of being an Air Traffic Controller (ret 55). Or is the decision making they are making different?  I dont know the answer from a scientific standpoint.  I certainly think is we just had term limits that would fix a lot of this something like you can serve in an elected position for no more then 12 years .  We would get some old people but not for that long, but we could potentially still end up with a couple of 80 year old presidents still so its not a perfect solution.",Lanracie,2025-04-08T09:36:14,1
"The complexity of the US political system makes the issue of age seem relatively insignificant in comparison to the many other problems that need to be addressed.   There are so many issues that need fixing that the age question feels more like a minor concern rather than a meaningful change.   For example, political power pedaling, the influence of political parties, gerrymandering, social media's impact, misinformation, government agencies’ party affiliations, and the fact that the government itself holds the only power to change its structure.   Additionally, the amendment process is not controlled by the public, the public vote does not directly elect the president, and vice presidents are appointed rather than elected, political parties control who can run for office, and lobbying also plays a major role.   These are just a few examples, and there are many more. None of these issues will change because doing so would upset the balance of power for the parties.   In my opinion, these discussions are little more than a pipe dream. Until a way is found to force a constitutional revision that returns the power of government to the people instead of politicians, trying to effect change feels like screaming at a brick wall.  I’ve heard many times throughout my life, and especially on Reddit, that while we may not have direct control over Congress’s actions, we do control who gets elected into Congress, so we have power. This statement, however, is factually misleading and creates a false sense of the people's power.   We may have some influence at smaller levels, such as city or county elections, but when it comes to higher offices, the people have no control. Political parties decide who will appear on the ballot, and any candidate not backed by the party has no chance of making it to a true position of power.",Balanced_Outlook,2025-04-08T09:40:47,1

100%. Most people are just voting for a party or a name they recognize and that allows for a lot of entrenchment and makes it so people can hold onto power for way longer than they should be able to. Our elections also favor wealthier people because of the cost to run a campaign and there’s literally no one more out of touch with the realities of the average person than an old ass wealthy person.,itsdeeps80,2025-04-08T10:51:42,1
Just have term limits. Make them short. Two or three terms. That avoids 95% of the problem and solves a bunch of others.

"Chuck Schumer (D) NY 74 would not have been able to get reelected so often and thus have the ability to funnel huge amounts of federal dollars back to his state. He will continue to get reelected because of this.  Robert Byrd  (D) died at the age of 93 after representing West Virginia (a poor state) in the Senate for 51 years. He was famous for the amount of money he funneled to his state.  Just to show some bipartisanship,  The same holds true for Susan Collins (R) Maine 72 also brings federal dollars to Maine, which is the poorest state in NE. She regularly gets Democrat votes in a state that twice rejected Donald Trump and has a Democrat governor.  The longer your senator or representative stays in office, the more money they'll be able to funnel back to your state.

Can be paper or interview, recorded for live consumption. The test is long but with few questions as each question should be thought out. On the eve of the Congressman's reelection (Before the person is declared victorious) and/or 50th birthday, there would be a new test based on logical, logistical, and economical government practices.  Government officials should have reasonable levels of critical thinking skills, as well as a strong fiscal standpoint. There is no way of quantifying the results of the test, and it is not on a pass or fail basis. There would be a board of rotating economists and PhD recipients. PhDs would have to be validated by 10 years minimum of field practice. They would have to be unpaid, unbiased, no public partisanship, and cannot be chosen by representatives of political parties (Congressman, President, or otherwise elected)  Answers given would be analyzed by all members of the board, deliberation taking up to the day of the person's first term, but no later.

"Yes. This exists for both politicians and other federal employees in several countries and it is a good system. Typically the federal retirement age is set between 68 to 72 years.   The benefits are obvious, and the necessity should also be. A system that does not protect against gerontocracy will be consumed by it. Wealthy gerontocrats accumulate unbeatable assets while in office and have little interest or knowledge in present day issues affecting families.  At 72, a person should be finishing their political career. Not starting it. We wouldn't need octogenarians to maintain political cohesion if septugenarians weren't holding down seats and stopping people in their 40s or 50s from getting their start. And the wealth of a 70 year old politician is not comparable to a well-off you get challenger.  For example, Dianne Feinstein earned more than enough in her second to last term in Congress to outfund every competitor in her last race, combined, just through personal funds. She won that election as a near corpse purely through name recognition and personal wealth.  And yeah, these are also mostly the people that abuse insider trading the most as well. Feinstein sold stocks after receiving a private briefing on Covid-19, for instance, and her stocks massively beat the market.  With a retirement age, we'd still have politicians with decades of experience (unlike with term limits, for instance), but they'd be overall younger and better equipped to handle modern issues.",ManBearScientist,2025-04-09T10:37:47,1

"This appears to be a distinctly American question coming from the left.  The US has older politicians because American politics have become a dedicated institutionalized job that requires a substantial fundraising component for anyone who is in it for the long haul.  But the reason for the need for fundraising is not because of the usual suspects of the left (Citizens United!) but is a logical response to the drawn-out election cycles that make US elections enormously expensive.  A lot of that is due to the primary system, which turns every election into a multi-month expensive slog with this two-stage election process and all of the campaigning that this entails.  This is mostly a self-inflicted problem.  The primary system in its current form has only existed for the last five decades, and was a reaction to the 1968 Democratic convention.  Other western democracies have their parties choose their candidates and the voters just choose among the parties.  Some of it is also due to the fixed election cycles, which are set in the constitution.  Other western democracies can and do call snap elections, which gives them only weeks to prepare.  Americans don't have this and they never will.  Make it easier to get into and out of politics, and the politicians will get younger.  Get rid of primaries, and those younger people can be selected directly by the parties that can in turn focus on the fundraising and avoid spending money on primary campaigns that no longer exist.  Getting rid of primaries would also help to reduce the impact of populism on politics.  If there were no primaries, Trump would have never been the Republican nominee, as the party leaders would not have selected him.  A 2016 election without primaries would have probably pitted Hillary Clinton against Jeb Bush, not Donald Trump.",I405CA,2025-04-08T09:49:14,1

I realize people want to avoid a witch hunt, where there are required mental checks and one party could politicize them and DQ perfectly healthy members.

Plus it's already done in some cases like Florida.  In Florida, drivers aged 80 and older must renew their license every six years and pass a vision test at each renewal, either at a driver's license office or by a licensed medical professional.  Here's a more detailed breakdown of Florida's laws regarding elderly drivers: Renewal Cycle: Drivers aged 80 and older must renew their license every six years, whereas drivers under 80 can renew every eight years.  Vision Test: Drivers aged 80 and older are required to pass a vision test at every license renewal.  Vision Test Options: The vision test can be taken at a Florida driver's license service center or administered by a licensed medical doctor, osteopathic physician, or optometrist.  Vision Standards: Drivers must have 20/70 vision in either eye with or without corrective lenses.  Reporting Unsafe Drivers: Florida allows, and even encourages, people to confidentially report drivers who are a hazard on the road to the DHSMV.  Medical Review Process: After receiving a report about an unsafe driver, the DHSMV may require a driver to take a re-examination (vision, written, or driving test) or submit a medical report for review by the Medical Advisory Board.  Restrictions: The DHSMV can place restrictions or conditions on a person's driver's license, such as requiring glasses or corrective contact lenses, or limiting driving to daylight hours.

"Italy is chaotic to an almost stereotypical degree.  Americans can look north to the Canadians for an example of what a more orderly snap election can look like.  They are having one as we speak.  They will select and install the next head of government in less time than it would take for the US to get through a few presidential primaries, and they will spend less money in the process.  Mark Carney was selected by his party electors, who comprise a relatively small percentage of the electorate and who all vote at the same time.  And because the leading party does not need to form a coalition in Canada, winning with a plurality will be enough, thereby reducing the risk of extremism.

Part of why it's so big now is it is much harder to hide, especially for people in the spotlight (e.g., you might hide some back bench Congressional rep, but not POTUS or a prominent Senator / party leader).  There's a reason why so many voters were concerned with Biden's age even before the debate and despite the fact he wasn't much older than Trump.  It was just really clear for awhile, he was diminished, but if you point this out you'd get called abelist and people were pretending it was just his stutter.  One of the funniest and saddest parts of the last election cycle was when some hack account like the RNC's attack account would post a clearly edited video of Biden looking really out of it, some Democratic account would always respond correctly pointing out the video was selectively edited and posting the full video...... only the full video also looked pretty bad.  Less bad than the edited one, but it was just so painfully clear he wasn't there.  And it's sad to me that if you voiced that concern you were shouted down.

The whole issue should have been addressed directly and calmly, but that's not a world we live in anymore.  I've had a lot of thoughts about what could have won the election for Harris, or another Democratic candidate, but... I've had to put that all away. There are just too many variables to pin down any single thing that would have changed the final outcome. That way lies madness.  To my thinking, the weirdest strategic misstep in the whole last election cycle was how obviously surprised and unprepared the Republicans were when Joe Biden stepped down from the campaign. After years of loudly and aggressively insisting he was too old and too infirm, they clearly hadn't prepared for what to do, if he actually did quit.
