"We need to swamp this dictatorship with mountains of lawsuits as a weapon against this tyranny.  Money, power and cruelty are their incentives, glad to see you are standing up and shouting.",Brytnshyne,2025-04-23T10:05:04,30
"What about fElon? He and his DOGE flunkies have assaulted government employees, illegally accessed and vandalized critical government databases and their corresponding data processing software systems. Wouldn't that be grounds for a multi billion dollar lawsuit?",Old_Fossil_MKE,2025-04-23T10:03:14,16

Wow. Glad to hear it StoneMaire games. I play a lot of their board games and enjoy them all.,IndecorousRex,2025-04-23T11:09:41,5
"Glad to see the fight, but what is the legal strategy here? As bad as they are, raising tariffs is one of the few things that Trump has done that he actually has full legal authority to do. So what is the lawsuit based on?  EDIT: seems like tariffs still need to be based on an [intelligible principle](https://www.usconstitution.net/executive-tariff-authority/) and cannot be generalized. Perhaps that's the basis?",climactivated,2025-04-23T10:50:52,1
He is trying to drown us... Seems like the appropriate response.Â ,Lebarican22,2025-04-23T11:10:55,12
"Fed Agencies that collect sensitive data (like your personal records), have laws in place allowing citizens to gain financial compensation, but only under certain situations.  It's possible that a DOGE bro would fall into 'improper access', or that the data is being used in an improper way.  If this is the case then Musk would quickly go from World's richest man to World's poorest.   But, this would require proof of wrongdoing.",crucial_geek,2025-04-23T21:21:38,2
"As I understand it, Trump is basing his tariff authority on the use of emergency powers.  He's arguing that the existence of a long-standing trade deficit is an ""emergency.""    The problem is, it's hard to argue that in good faith.  What exactly makes this an ""emergency?""  Trade deficits aren't new, they've been around for decades, and they're not even a bad thing.  Like obviously a rich country like the US is going to have a trade deficit with a poor country like Ghana - because the poor country can only export raw materials and can't afford to buy anything in return.  Trade doesn't need to be ""balanced"" from country to country.  It's ok to buy coffee from Colombia and sell consulting services to Sweden.  That's literally the way trade works.  That's the way we *designed* it to work.  Nothing about this is an ""emergency.""    Or, to put it another way, by his definition, literally anything can be an emergency.",Xytak,2025-04-23T11:30:07,7
"I think it's important to note that the Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse, not the President. Saying he has full legal authority is a stretch.",Amenian,2025-04-23T12:35:09,3
"To be clear, his authority here doesn't come from the Constitution, it comes from Congress who has delegated their authority on tariffs to the President through a series of laws passed in the mid-20th century.  Congress could pass new laws to un-delegate this authority from the President (though I don't see that happening under this administration).  However I think u/Xytak's comments clear this up for me. Seems like the *rationale* for these tariffs stretches beyond the President's authority for limited or targeted tariff negotiation given by Congress.",climactivated,2025-04-23T15:35:06,2
