I’ve never seen a cherry on the rim of a margarita.  Lime maybe.,miscstarsong,2025-04-19T11:01:49,11
"In his post, President Trump wrote: “This is the hand of the man that the Democrats feel should be brought back to the United States, because he is such ‘a fine and innocent person.’ They said he is not a member of MS-13, even though he’s got MS-13 tattooed onto his knuckles, and two Highly Respected Courts found that he was a member of MS-13, beat up his wife, etc. I was elected to take bad people out of the United States, among other things. I must be allowed to do my job. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”  Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador this week after the Salvadoran government initially denied him access to Garcia. After press coverage, he said, officials arranged a meeting at a hotel, which was filmed. He said Salvadoran soldiers had previously stopped him from approaching the prison and that he was surprised by the last-minute permission to meet.   Van Holland really doesn’t care about Kilmar Garcia but news media coverage is great for Van Holland, who is narcissistic!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-19T04:38:50,42

I'm not particularly opposed to people having a drink while discussing business in a casual setting.,king-of-boom,2025-04-19T10:25:24,5
"Bingo!  With the left completely leaderless, Democrats are jockeying to see who can be their leader for the next Presidential election by getting the most media coverage. Think about it- have we ever heard of this Van Hollen before his stupid political stunt? Nope.   The entire Democrat party is playing a massive ‘Survivor’ type game right now.  With Nancy Pelosi not pulling their strings, any Democrat can fight to become their defacto leader. Look at Corey Booker’s wacky and ridiculous 24-hour filibuster against Trump. It was dumb and didn’t accomplish a thing, yet The View (barf) had him on, proclaiming him to be the savior of them all against Orange Man Bad. How brave! (Lmao) This whole tour that AOC and Bernie are doing? Same thing. They’re self-described Socialists for God’s sake, but the crazy left want to anoint them the head of the party? That won’t enlarge their reach, in my opinion. Whoever wins this PR race (happening in real time) will get the most media attention, and therefore the most monetary contributions. Needlessly to say, none of them are doing anything different or implementing policy changes from your standard 2024 Democrat platform, but that doesn’t matter. Stay tuned - it’ll be fun to watch!",142Ironmanagain,2025-04-19T07:50:43,20
