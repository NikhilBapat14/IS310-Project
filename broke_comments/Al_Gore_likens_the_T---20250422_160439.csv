Trump administration styles its attacks on liberty after Nazi Germany.,LuvKrahft,2025-04-22T16:09:38,15
"I think he's done a lot - maybe more than anyone? - to bring attention to the coming climate apocalypse.  But let's be real - this is also the guy who punked out when the Republicans stole an election, and set the standard for Democrats punking out for the next three decades.",haytil,2025-04-22T16:09:53,1

"> this is also the guy who punked out when the Republicans stole an election,  The supreme court handed that election to Bush. What was Gore supposed to do after that?",Cat_herder_81,2025-04-22T16:16:54,15

"I like Gore, but the bare minimum for a presidential candidate should be to win their home state.  Say what you want about the Florida mess, but running a candidate from a deep red small state that wouldn't support him was not the best option for Democrats at that time.  Not a popular opinion, but the electoral college makes it necessary.",MentalTourniquet,2025-04-22T16:49:19,-2
The fact that this is your response (and was Gore's response) - and that it is *not* Trump's response when they rule against him - is exactly why Trump is getting everything he wants and you (and Gore) aren't.,haytil,2025-04-22T16:41:05,-3
"> Say what you want about the Florida mess,   I will, as the Florida ""mess"" as you call it is the only thing that kept Gore from being president.   >but running a candidate from a deep red small state that wouldn't support him   So because his home state was full of bigoted assholes that wouldn't support him means he shouldn't run? That's lunacy. Using your metric Lincoln wouldn't have been president.",Cat_herder_81,2025-04-22T16:58:18,7
So your answer is Gore should have ignored the law and started an insurrection the way Trump did?   How would that have been any better for the US?,Cat_herder_81,2025-04-22T16:44:25,10

That didn't answer my question.   How would an insurrection be any better for the US? What would it have accomplished? How would it have been any different from Trumps?,Cat_herder_81,2025-04-22T16:54:52,5
"Perhaps it would have led to a population being riled up to the point of rising up and *restoring* a democracy, where everyone's vote *counts*.  No ""hanging chad"" bullshit to enable voter suppression, followed by a series of right-wing Supreme Court installments which creates the domino effect and further erosion of our democracy that got us to this point.  And if you don't know how a post-insurrection Gore administration would have been any different from a post-insurrection Trump administration, then I don't know what to tell you.  The question is both so broad and so transparently self-evident that I can't believe anyone would even ask that.",haytil,2025-04-22T17:02:34,2
"> restoring a democracy, where everyone's vote counts.   We've never had that before; why would an insurrection change that?   But say Gore's insurrection was successful. Congress was controlled by republicans in 2001. What would have stopped them from immediately impeaching and convicting Gore of insurrection?   > The question is both so broad and so transparently self-evident that I can't believe anyone would even ask that.  And yet you couldn't actually answer the question; quite telling.",Cat_herder_81,2025-04-22T17:05:59,3
"> What would have stopped them from immediately impeaching and convicting Gore of insurrection?  The Republicans didn't control 67 seats in the Senate.  You can't get a conviction without the Democrats.  > And yet you couldn't actually answer the question; quite telling.   I'm not going to dignify your sea-lioning, and I'm pretty upfront about it.  Also, I would be remiss if I didn't point out the ludicrous nature of your equivocating a ""Gore Insurrection"" (supporting the will of the people for a rightfully elected president) to the ""Trump Insurrection"" (which was an attempt to *discard* the will of the people, who had voted Biden into office, not Trump).",haytil,2025-04-22T17:10:14,1
"> The Republicans didn't control 67 seats in the Senate. You can't get a conviction without the Democrats.  Look at the democrats of the time. Do you think republicans couldn't get enough dems to vote to impeach and convict the guy who just overthrew an election through violent means?   We're talking about the same dems that backed the Patriot Act, the war in Iraq, and the war in Afganistan.   >I'm not going to dignify your sea-lioning, and I'm pretty upfront about it.  In other words you can't actually answer my questions, you're just gung ho to live in a totalitarian state as long as it's *your* guy who is dictator in chief.",Cat_herder_81,2025-04-22T17:18:18,3

"> Interesting that the only alternative you see to not totally conceding is ""violence.""  Ok Mr. Wise One. How else do you overthrow an election that the highest court in the land just ruled on? I'd love to hear the other options.",Cat_herder_81,2025-04-22T17:59:27,2
