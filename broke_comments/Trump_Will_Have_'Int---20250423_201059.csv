"From reporter Lydia O'Connor:  President Donald Trump will dine with the top 220 holders of his $TRUMP memecoin at an event billed as “the most EXCLUSIVE INVITATION in the World,” the cryptocurrency announced Wednesday.  A promotion for the black tie optional event at Trump National Golf Club in the capital features a rendering of Trump that mildly resembles him and promises an “unforgettable Gala DINNER” on May 22. It also explicitly tells hopeful attendees to “hold as much $TRUMP as you can” from Wednesday through May 12 to rise in the ranks on the cryptocurrency’s “leaderboard.”  Link to the full article: [https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-memecoin-dinner-promotion\_n\_6809694de4b0c4479136c2f1?utm\_medium=Social&utm\_source=reddit&utm\_campaign=us\_main](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-memecoin-dinner-promotion_n_6809694de4b0c4479136c2f1?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=us_main)",huffpost,2025-04-23T20:11:27,9

"*Bribery and Corrupt Financial Schemes:*        Trump is engaged in a complex bribery scheme using cryptocurrency, stock manipulation, and pay-to-play access.       • Trump-affiliated crypto projects, like “Trump Coin,” have been linked to fraudulent investors under federal investigation.          There are strong indications that foreign entities are using these crypto schemes to funnel money directly to Trump-affiliated businesses.       • Violates 18 U.S.C. § 201 (Bribery of Public Officials) – Accepting or soliciting anything of value in exchange for official acts.        • Violates the Foreign Emoluments Clause (Article I, Section 9, Clause 8) – Accepting foreign financial benefits without congressional approval.        *DJT Stock Manipulation:*           • Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) stock allocations have been flagged as a tool for insider trading and illicit payoffs.          High-dollar donors and foreign investors have been given stock in exchange for political influence.        • Violates 15 U.S.C. § 78j (Securities Fraud) – Fraudulent schemes involving securities to deceive investors.         • Violates 18 U.S.C. § 1343 (Wire Fraud) – Financial deception via electronic communications.
