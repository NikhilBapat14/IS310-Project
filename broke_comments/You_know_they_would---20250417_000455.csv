"Wilson Fisk is a smart character who is hell bent on improving his city at any cost, including killing in bulk. The real one however is just a dumb, grifter who just got a big following because his followers refuse to accept they are wrong. This is just it, they got in on the grift and can't accept they are wrong and will die defensign their choice.",Msink,2025-04-17T06:42:07,4
"I get this post but really, it goes without saying. It’s quite clear that this reboot of Daredevil is taking a lot of inspiration for Fisk from Trump. Except that Trump is a small, weak, man child and Fisk could fuck most people up.",hudi2121,2025-04-17T07:10:20,3

"If Putin ran for president instead of being the puppet master of current one, they will vote for him.",Msink,2025-04-17T06:43:04,12
Fisk might actually be a better choice than Trump. Fisk is evil but competent. Also probably not a rapist.,dropzone_jd,2025-04-17T01:53:30,21
"Fisk can and will throw hands if he has to/wants to and he'll do pretty damn well at it, even if he consistently loses to a blind lawyer from Hell's Kitchen.   That *other* guy who currently hangs out in the Oval Office has likely never thrown hands once in his life.",belladonnagilkey,2025-04-17T02:25:25,7
