"The three titles you gave do drastically different things. But district offices will not have a legislative director. They’re usually DC based.   General descriptions are on the Senate Employment website: https://employment.senate.gov/position-descriptions/  Most, if not all, will ask for some Hill or Hill Adjacent experience. Anything director level will be at least 4+ years.  Salaries range drastically between positions and offices. I would look up specific offices and what they’re currently paying: https://www.senate.gov/legislative/common/generic/report_secsen.htm",districtsidepols,2025-01-22T23:00:45,2
