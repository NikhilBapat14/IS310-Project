Beware folks. This is but a District Court. Back in the day... That meant something. Not anymore. So it now goes to Appellate then ultimately SCOTUS. Until they hear this... Assume his plans to limit voting rights are going as planned. This was all defined in Project 2025.,williamgman,2025-04-24T17:08:45,1

"Why is proving you are a US citizen before you can vote such a big deal? Only a US citizen has the right to vote. So it stands to reason that those who are against this can only be non-citizens, or some political party that benefits from illegal votes. When did common sense and reason go out the fucking window? If you went to Germany, or Canada, or Italy do you think they wouldn’t check your citizenship before allowing you to vote?!? WTF is wrong with this country?",DaboJunkie,2025-04-24T21:41:57,1
The conservatives on the Supreme Court should uphold this ruling.  The ruling is based upon the fact that elections are largely a state matter.  The feds don't play much role in how elections are conducted and have no good argument for turning this aspect of elections into an exception.,I405CA,2025-04-24T17:24:41,1
"They're also likely to use this as another excuse for when they try to do their own version of the Enabling Act. We've already had them testing the waters and normalizing in that direction, between Johnson talking about eliminating lower courts and Miller and the ghouls on Fox conflating whatever Trump wants with ""the Will of the People"".",Crommach,2025-04-24T18:27:55,1
"The Supreme Court can't hear all of the cases against the Trump Admin - there's only so much room on their docket.  ""Flood the zone"" also works against Trump.",JakeConhale,2025-04-24T18:59:49,1

"It's adding extra layers to voting, layers which cost money and complicate the process through requiring ever-increasing amounts of documentation.  When I started voting, I presented my driver's license to get my voter registration card, and presented my voter registration card when I voted.  That was it.  With this legislation, I have to have a driver's license, a copy of my birth certificate (which i already had to present in order to get my driver's license) **and** my passport (which i already had to present the previous two identifying documents to acquire), and they all have to match.  If I married and changed my surname to that of my spouse, I have to get a copy of my marriage license in addition to everything else and go through a lengthy process of updating *all of my documentation* before I can vote.  If I've been adopted by a step-parent and taken that person's surname, same thing applies.  It's a big deal because a hundred million people could be disallowed the right to vote, based purely on *manufactured technicalities specifically designed to prevent voters from voting*.  It's called voter suppression.  And it *sucks*.  It's wrong in every way and on every level, an underhanded way for corrupt politicians to secure their offices by pretending that people simply don't exist.  It violates both the spirit of the Constitution and the letter of the law, but, like gerrymandering, it's a tactic that hasn't been ruled illegal (yet).",LuminaraCoH,2025-04-24T22:05:15,1

"No, it’s not a big deal. You do realize many states issue drivers licenses to undocumented migrants? So by your own account they can vote. This is the same old clap trap bullshit everyone spews that blocks citizenship verification. Act like 100 million people are too stupid, or inept, or lacking resources to prove their citizenship. Yet, i bet if i had a million dollar raffle, and you needed to prove citizenship to receive the prize, not a single fucking one would have a problem providing the documentation. In fact it takes more proof to get Comcast cable than it does to vote. Total fucking bullshit. Not to mention it’s a one time deal.",DaboJunkie,2025-04-24T22:14:34,1
"I think that they'll actually go with it.  It doesn't prohibit states from demanding proof of citizenship.  But the states have the latitude to make that decision.  The argument that would support the district court was made by none other than the right-wing Scalia in the voter ID case *Crawford v Marion County*.  >It is for state legislatures to weigh the costs and benefits of possible changes to their election codes, and their judgment must prevail unless it imposes a severe and unjustified overall burden upon the right to vote, or is intended to disadvantage a particular class.  >[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-21.ZC.html](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-21.ZC.html)",I405CA,2025-04-24T17:28:15,1
"Except the rates of actual voted fraud are exceedingly low. https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-widespread-is-election-fraud-in-the-united-states-not-very/  Non-citizens are not registering to vote beyond a couple of idiots who didn’t realize they were not supposed to.  Forcing proof of citizenship in the way they propose will actively disenfranchise any married woman who changed her name because she’ll need an ID, birth certificate, and marriage license. Think about all of the people in the LA area who lost their homes, I’ll bet a lot of them lost important documents like marriage licenses and birth certificates. Or how about hurricane prone areas?  And it’s for literally no good reason. There is no evidence of the kind of fraud that this aims to prevent.",writebadcode,2025-04-24T22:34:11,1
Crawford was brought to the SC deliberately so that they could rule in such a way as to further weaken the Voter Rights Act.   Don't expect them to use it as any sort of precedent when this case gets before them.,Cat_herder_81,2025-04-24T18:30:43,1
