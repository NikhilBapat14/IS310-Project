"Except Franklin county, every country on the list voted for trump with 80+% of the vote cast in 2024.  That's the leopards eat their face moment.",thieh,2025-04-24T13:10:58,50
Yet despite that & the fact that besides the governor's office the GOP has controlled the state for decades it will still be Beshear's fault. ,Competitive-Bike-277,2025-04-24T13:02:07,21

Should refer to it as the **'MAGA controlled FEMA'**   If they can't take responsibility for voting for this administration then they should absolutely defend their results.,citizenjones,2025-04-24T14:57:27,3

Kind of crazy that bigger outlets aren’t covering this. They sure loved sharing stories about FEMA when Biden was president. ,Elegant_Plate6640,2025-04-24T21:27:26,1

"Much as I despise the current Administration, this is actually normal. The level and amount of damages didn’t meet the criteria required to declare those specific counties, whether it be for individual or public assistance.  It is based on the severity of, and how widespread, the damages are.   The President only signs or doesn’t sign the declaration of disaster for the entire state, FEMA  itself decides which counties are eligible for either of those types of assistance.  That said, by running his stupid mouth all the time, I find it hilarious that he gets the blame for this. He clearly doesn’t understand how any government agencies actually work.",fuckinoldbastard,2025-04-24T14:31:50,2

"Your point still stands, but up until 2017, the GOP hadn't had control of the Kentucky legislature in almost a century. There were some pretty conservative Democrats in that time, but yeah, KY used to be pretty solid blue at the state level.   But also, yes. Even though they pretty much stripped all of Andy's power with that veto proof super majority, they still blame anything that happens on him and the morons eat it up.",RA1NMAN6,2025-04-24T14:09:01,2

"> “[B]ased on the results of the joint Preliminary Damage Assessments, it has been determined that the impact to the individuals and households in Butler, Franklin, Knox, Laurel, Lawrence, and Whitley Counties is not of the severity and magnitude to warrant their designation under the Individual Assistance program.” >  > The letter goes on to say that the “impact to the infrastructure in Simpson and Woodford Counties is not of the severity and magnitude to warrant their designation under the Public Assistance program.” >  > Gov. Beshear requested a Major Disaster Declaration from President Donald Trump on April 11 for the early-April flooding. The state is still waiting to hear if that request has been approved. >",tech57,2025-04-24T13:19:22,1
