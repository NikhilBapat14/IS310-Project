"I just want to say that the *only* reason Tesla made money in Q1 was the federal subsidies they get. For a guy who thinks that only businesses that can pay their own way should exist, I think these programs should be terminated for Tesla.

"Musk: ‚ÄúI thought the left was supposed to be the party of compassion and empathy‚Äù (me paraphrasing): ‚Äúall I did was commit fraud by purchasing a presidential candidate to absolve the investigations into the unlawful conduct of my various companies, then proceeded to vilify, and dehumanize hard working experts in civil service due to a deranged hatred I have of wine because one of my 22 children is a trans woman, and if a power drunk intoxication I sent my tech minions into the most sensitive corners of the federal government. What did I do? Why is everyone so mad at me?‚Äù   F*ckin d*ck!!

"I‚Äôm going to keep beating this drum. Am I the only one who sees that Elon credibly has committed the crime of espionage in public with Doge? He‚Äôs not an approved government agent official by Congress and he stole the nation‚Äôs citizens‚Äô information. Which likely includes information of foreign nationals, businesses, etc, anyone doing business in the US or owning property/etc.  On top of that, he‚Äôs been in charge of slashing and reallocating money for established government services, and nobody has any idea where any of that is going. I repeat, Congress is responsible allocating how money should be spent. The President is responsible for spending it.  We don‚Äôt know what Elon plans to do with this. He could easily hand it over to someone else. There‚Äôs absolutely no oversight. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen so cut and dry a huge crime in my entire life.

"Republicans have now scrapped funding for the decades-long Women's Health Initiative. That project has already yielded remarkable insights into the health of women of all ages, helping to make up for many, many years of poor research into conditions uniquely impacting women.

"Musk will go down in history as a prime example of KARMA. He hates those that he considers to be losers because somewhere in the deepest recesses of that twisted brain of his he hates himself and this was supposed to make him feel better about himself and empower him, yep he's a loser and he's losing more with each passing day. If he thinks that he can just walk away from all of this and the dust will settle and people will forget, then he is gravely mistaken. If he has anything of a few non-Ketamine damaged brain cells left, he will take what wealth he has and disappear forever because there will always be someone somewhere waiting to get at him. So Mr. Musk, take a couple of rearview mirrors off of one of your fire hazard vehicles and install them on each side of your head, you'll need to be wary.....",Shoddy_Concern1332,2025-04-23T15:51:18,3

How do you feel sorry for someone who has zero worries? Who will never have any worries that aren't as shallow and pedantic as he is.   We've all been hurt by this. Affected. Infected.  Guinea pigs playing a part in Trump's next failed venture.  Thank you to the 51% who enabled this. I can only take solace in the fact that you'll be the ones hit the hardest.

"He found absolutely ZERO waste and fraud. If you work in the government, you know that while there is some waste, there is not a lot. The primary reason: there is barely enough money to cover the salaries and benefits of the people working there.  Most people in goverment jobs are working on 2-10 year old computers, running windows 7-10, and some ancient version of office. They might have migrated to 365. Maybe.  Most databases are held together with duct tape and chewing gum, and anyone who breathes wrong on it will bring the entire system down.  Where is the majority of fraud, waste, and abuse? With the contractors. They exorbitantly bid on projects, they over-promise and under-deliver routinely.   There are laws in place where a certain percentage of work that goes on with the government MUST be outsourced to contractors. So the powers that be make sure their buddies get those contracts, they never really expect them to produce the product they are paying for, and eventually the in-house teams build whatever it is themselves.  Almost 100% of Fraud, Waste, and Abuse resides with the contractors who are bilking the government for hundreds of billions of dollars.  He should have started there, the absolute idiot.",Ayste,2025-04-24T09:46:15,1

They pick our pockets to line theirs. They only care about tax breaks they don't need and making us pay the bills.
