"""I get to keep everything I've stolen through war and we'll call it 'peace' until Russia's rearmed and strengthened enough to conquer more of Ukraine.""  What a peace plan.",FIlm2024,2025-04-22T15:52:48,1
"Bigger than I thought, but Putin wants to draw a line in the sand that he gets to keep all that he's collected as of now.   If that works then next year we'll see him enter Poland and try the same things.  Edited to add that the ammo dump is very near Moscow and they pulled this off during daylight hours.  This has the added bonus that people living around Moscow thought they were safe and *surprise*.  Plus this takes a lot of ammo off the board, making it harder for Putin to mount new assaults.     I'll guess our Orange Leader will have something to say about this ""attack on Russia"" in a few hours.",kiltedturtle,2025-04-22T12:56:31,14

"While the invasion is wrong and immoral, who is going to take that territory back from Russia?  This is not a rhetorical question. Ukraine is losing soldiers daily perhaps at a much lower rate than Russia but still losing. Do you think Ukraine (even with Western arms) will endure a street by street battle in the cities Russia has captured? There is almost zero chance that any European or US army will actively engage Russia in Ukraine.  There is no diplomatic path that can force Russia to abandon that land.  BS or not, if this is something that is on the table, it is probably as good as anything that can be negotiated the way things are.",phiwong,2025-04-22T13:16:14,1

I think the moral thing for western countries to do would be to let Ukraine make that decision as part of any peace deal. If Ukraine doesn't want to accept those terms then western countries should continue to back them up for as long as they want to fight.,-CJF-,2025-04-22T13:35:54,8
"> While the invasion is wrong and immoral, who is going to take that territory back from Russia?  Provide the weapons and support and Ukraine will.   Meanwhile why would you so quickly sell off land that belongs to Ukraine?  Russia politically cannot keep this war going.  Putin is losing time and people.",TintedApostle,2025-04-22T13:37:29,6
"> Do you think Ukraine (even with Western arms) will endure a street by street battle in the cities Russia has captured  They've already done this and it's why they're at a stalemate well inside the Russian gains from 2022.  There's even fighting inside Russian territory. Sure, it's not very deep but it still tells you that Russia doesn't have the upper hand here.",Grandpa_No,2025-04-22T14:02:28,4
"Massive missile depot *east* of Moscow exploded catastrophically.  They are saying “human error”.  So, it could be that he’s cringing at having lost all those weapons… or, if it wasn’t human error, he could be cringing at someone’s ability to reach targets on the far side of Moscow from Ukraine.   I suspect that the new French missiles that would have the ability to (finally) remove the Kerch bridge from the board would also play a role.",lesmainsdepigeon,2025-04-22T16:18:53,2
