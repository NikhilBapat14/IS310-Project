"Their champions right now are a bartender and Grandpa Simpson regurgitating the same tired rhetoric no one cares about.  Their last president turned the White House into the worlds most secure memory care facility.  Their last presidential candidate spent a billion dollars on a campaign but couldn't do one legitimate interview.  The entire party has turned their entire governance platform into an unhealthy obsession with hating one person.  Finally, they've been goaded into publicly supporting actual terrorists and criminals due to trying to be the antithesis of that one man, who they are obsessed with.  All this is telling me is whatever percentage is left supporting them is incomprehensibly stupid.",Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-04-24T09:03:18,24
