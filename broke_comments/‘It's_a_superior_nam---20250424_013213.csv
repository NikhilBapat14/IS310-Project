"I do wish reporters would try to get these freaks to talk about sports more, because that is a litmus test of normalcy for so many men.  Like I think if somebody could get a video of Trump explaining how he thinks a football game works or what the different positions are, that would genuinely cause a lot of people to say “alright, enough with this guy”.  When they went after Tim Walz for being “just an assistant coach” a lot of their base couldn’t stop themselves from saying “well hang on now, he’s obviously a communist but we’re not gonna disrespect the importance of Defensive Coordinators.”",heech441,2025-04-24T02:01:40,14
I too prefer The Washington Football Team.,Aetylus,2025-04-24T01:34:54,19
">I can tell you I spoke to people of Indian heritage and they love that name and they love that team. And I think it’s a much, I think it’s a superior name to what they have right now.  With tears in their fuckin eyes. Big strong men.  This asshole.",4ivE,2025-04-24T01:36:24,19
"Look, i hope I never have to say this again but …ugh… *in all fairness to Donald*: he’s a senile fuck who probably doesn’t remember that they changed the name until someone reminds him. He’s just reacting to the reminder with the usual off-the-cuff dissembling that’s second nature to him, and I doubt he even understand what he’s bickering about.  I feel gross.",ANOKNUSA,2025-04-24T02:03:48,4
Never forget that his entire base only votes for him because of Archie Bunker like takes. He’s literally never had a cogent thought about anything. All it takes to get Boomers is to remind them of the 70’s.,The_GreatSantini,2025-04-24T02:04:17,7

"Such a weird take. Commanders is a great team name. Sure, the whole name changing  process was awkward, but I don't think anyone can seriously argue that Commanders isn't the objectively better name.",nadiwereb,2025-04-24T03:19:26,3
Maybe you can have somebody arrested over it.,LeatherChaise,2025-04-24T01:40:15,2

"I heard a few conservatives call Tim Walz an out of touch coastal elite with no real experience.  Tim Walz.  The  guy who is a veteran, former factory worker, former farmer, former school teacher, former football coach, avid hunter, former representative, and governor of Minnesota.  ""Out of touch.  Elitist.  No experience.""     They're not actually speaking.  They are repeating sounds.  There is no context or coherence to what those sounds  even mean, just inferences from emotional associations between certain strings of phonemes.   The left brain is empty.",GaimeGuy,2025-04-24T02:39:35,17
The coach thing was so dumb. Acting like they caught him in a lie. Saying you were a football coach doesn't at all imply head coach.  And let's just say he did actually say he was a head coach and was lying about. It would definitely be a dumb thing to lie about....hmm wonder who does that every 5 seconds. Lol Trump's physical stats tells you he's supposed to look like a football player,ATLfalcons27,2025-04-24T04:47:28,7
This is why if Trump keeps threatening these Universities they should just cancel their athletics programs. Most athletics programs generate no profit for their schools.   No fall football. No March Madness. All Trump's fault.,The-Real-Number-One,2025-04-24T06:30:09,3
"I live in Alabama where the locals mating call is ""RTR!"", and I can honestly say I don't care for any sport whatsoever.  People value sports more than human rights for some reason.",frigatesspc,2025-04-24T06:47:19,1

I am sure Vivek was willing to say anything if he thought it meant Trump would keep him in his administration as a member of DOGE... The bastard didn't even make it to the first day.,Shiplord13,2025-04-24T03:13:48,2
Amen to that.  I was long thinking he's like Eric Cartman but that works fine,stimmedcows,2025-04-24T03:03:25,1

"The former name needed to go, but Commanders sucks. Any team from Washington that naturally shortens to Commies is ill conceived. I would rather continue calling them the Washington Football Club.",Wings81,2025-04-24T05:16:34,1
