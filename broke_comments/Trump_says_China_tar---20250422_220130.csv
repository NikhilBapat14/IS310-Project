So basically we devalued our currency and lost international friends for what???!!!    Trump is the dumbest president in history.,ArcBounds,2025-04-22T22:10:34,70
~~Atlas Shrugged~~ Trump Blinked  So China agreed to absolutely nothing and got some relief.  Art of the deal!,MariosBrother1,2025-04-22T22:05:40,27

So china didn't do anything and trump blinked.... so was the point of liberation day just to fuck up the American economy and crash the bond market for nothing?,thefrail158,2025-04-22T22:22:03,17

Probably blinked cuz China was gonna sell off almost a $trilly worth of US treasury bonds all at once.  These are not serious people.,UnlevelSeaLeveler,2025-04-22T22:45:26,8
"We’re going to win so much, you’re going to be so sick and tired of winning, you’re going to come to me and go ‘Please, please, we can’t win anymore.’ You’ve heard this one. You’ll say ‘Please, Mr. President, we beg you sir, we don’t want to win anymore. It’s too much. It’s not fair to everybody else. And I’m going to say I’m sorry, but we’re going to keep winning, winning, winning, We’re going to make America great again.” -- Trump",PicoRascar,2025-04-22T22:22:20,8

"Folded ""his cards"".",CouchCorrespondent,2025-04-22T22:06:19,3
Its good he is backing off but it was stupid to begin with. All for what guaranteed we lost trade that wont come back and now every country will likely increase trade with China and each other because they cant trust America so they will diversify away from the US.,sedatedlife,2025-04-22T22:48:25,4
"I think this is long term bad for US.    1. All trade deals are still upp in the air and he have shown weakness, and that playing hardball gives an advantage.   2. All new alternative trade routes that have been set up will stay, China will keep buy beef from Australia etc... Oil from Canada . 3. Tourism is probably dead for at least this season. ",rincewind007,2025-04-22T23:44:42,4

"Because of the tariffs, everyone moved their factories back to the US, we now have 10,000 new factories and 10,000,000 new jobs. So we don't need high tariffs anymore. MAGA.",minus2cats,2025-04-22T22:58:44,2

These hints are just market manipulation to enrich Trump’s chosen donors.,Limberine,2025-04-23T01:57:20,1
"Yawn.  Nothing surprising here.  That's par for the course (see how cleverly I snuck in that golf reference?) for what is -- nowadays -- a normal Tuesday evening on TruthSocial.

"Devaluing our currency was one of the goals, to make our exports more competitive. Which is stupid, of course. It hurts far more than it helps.",lannister80,2025-04-22T22:32:04,5
"ArcBounds asks:  ""...**for what???!!!**""  Silly you.  For media attention; becasue that's what winning is.: even bad press is good press -- anything is good so long as people keep talking about you.

"You got exactly what everyone voted for...An idiot.   The world is laughing it's head off at USA right now.   The world saw it coming but oh no, he's Donald.J.Trump the deal maker. lmfao.   The only way he knows how to make a deal is to basically hold them hostage over something that he wants in return.   Don't see Europe wanting their money back in minerals from Ukraine do you?   Voting Trump back in was a disaster waiting to happen.   Well.........................Enjoy!",Ok_Listen4480,2025-04-23T06:06:42,2
It's like bull riding at a rodeo.  Bulls have a basic instinct: the only thing the bull cares about is throwing off the global economy.  (I'm a simple person),Catspaw129,2025-04-23T05:37:17,1

He fully convinced himself that his mere presence in the White House would usher in a new golden age for America. He really does believe that the Ukraine war never would’ve happened had he been in office.  The world has given him a big reality check.,Advanced-Ad-4462,2025-04-22T23:28:51,7

"I wouldn't say China did nothing... they imposed retaliatory tariffs, cancelled Boeing orders, and stopped exporting rare earth minerals.  Seems Trump was suprised to learn that China does hold cards, and perhaps he should fold after all.",Belle_Requin,2025-04-23T01:37:57,4
