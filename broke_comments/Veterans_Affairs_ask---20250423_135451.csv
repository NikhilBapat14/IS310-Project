Anti-Christian bias? One problem with this is that Christianity in the US seems to have become a fascist ideology.,Reasonable-Ad-2592,2025-04-23T13:56:47,36
"Kicking out trans people who serve in the military is alright though, right? Can we not pretend like this administration gives a crap about our troops? Remember when he went to our most revered military cemetery section and took pictures for his campaign? He doesn't care about you!  He doesn't care about Christians either. He breaks every commandment, has never read a Bible and has only ever touched a Bible for photo shoots after tear gassing innocent protesters.",TheJadeGoddess,2025-04-23T13:59:06,8

"Well, since the Bible tells us ""thou shalt not kill"" and an awful lot of veterans have not obeyed that command, I'm afraid they'd have to report that the Armed Forces have an ""anti-Christian bias,"" since signing up to join a fighting force is pretty much based on the the notion that thou might just kill at some point.",NoOneStranger_227,2025-04-23T14:13:24,2

MAGA is “anti-Christian” in that they do not follow the precepts of Jesus and the apostles.,Prin_StropInAh,2025-04-23T14:12:18,1

"Does that include serial adultery/ fraud/ theft of cancer funds,  etc...  All which could be logically called ""antichristian""",just_bookmarking,2025-04-24T05:07:13,1
"They just mean treating LGTBQ+ people as people.  If treating people as people is against Christianity, then doing so is anti-Christian bias.    This happened at my workplace, where they accused the company of religious discrimination.   Their examples of religious discrimination were things like voluntary pronouns on signatures, non-conpulsury after-work events promoting diversity and inclusion, and a form for signing up to a work event that spouses could attend which allowed any combination of salutations (e.g. Mr for employee and Mr for the spouse).",IJustLoggedInToSay-,2025-04-23T14:03:47,18

"No, they specify anti-Christian bias, and I get the feeling that no religious bias at all is being defined as anti-Christian.",Beltaine421,2025-04-23T14:25:04,3
So Christianity today in the US allows people to be mean and heartless. Congratulations to that.,Reasonable-Ad-2592,2025-04-23T14:10:25,12
Yes. But the Christian thing to do is to report every single thing that is actually against the teachings of Christ. EVERY SINGLE THING.  I promise you that the anti Christian stuff that is happening there every single day is 99 percent MAGA doctrine.,MadAstrid,2025-04-23T15:02:53,4

"Not not even allows, _demands_.    Christians in the US are arguing that they can't even be Christian unless everyone (not just them, but the entire country) is excluding and discriminating against haram groups.     And I know there are moderate Christians out there, but they are awfully quiet when these things come up.",IJustLoggedInToSay-,2025-04-23T14:14:22,16
