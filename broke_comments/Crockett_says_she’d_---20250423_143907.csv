"""I was tested for my IQ; it was an easy test. And I got a score, some people say they can't believe it, 1776: a big number, a beautiful number, a number that, that really when you think about it, and we do think about it, don't we: the patriotism. Patriotism, patriotism that, quite frankly, that brought me back into office for my 2nd term-- Well, it should be my 3rd term after having the 2020 election stolen from me. Yet, Patriotism -- which is where we get the word 'patron' from -- yeah, that's right; a lot of people don't know that, but it's true. And I have been a patron, a smart patron with these tariffs: beautiful, powerful tariffs bringing millions of billions of dollars from people who ripped us off. They have, they really have, and that should never have happened, but SLEEPY JOE, you remember him? Sleep Joe Biden, that piece of work, I tell you, he really let you down.
