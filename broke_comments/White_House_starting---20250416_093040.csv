"This is interesting for one bright, shining, unavoidable reason:  Most news agencies use Reuters and AP as primary sources, because they have a legacy of being in every press inner circle imaginable.   This means that more of the other agencies will now be the first to have information.",squunkyumas,2025-04-16T12:44:59,9
"The same people who are crying about this were totally cool with Biden only taking pre screened questions, using a teleprompter, and being whisked away the second things got into unscripted territory. Remember them kicking the media out of the Oval Office suddenly?",Hot-Syrup-5833,2025-04-16T10:20:24,25

She doesn't have to call on them.  Put them in the back row and ignore.,bw2082,2025-04-16T10:59:40,21
This biggest problem with a policy like this will be getting President Trump to comply with it.  He doesn't hesitate to take questions from anyone.,Celebril63,2025-04-16T10:50:25,0
Trump has already taken more unscripted questions from leftist media outlets then Biden did of any media outlets in his four years. ,Pinot_Greasio,2025-04-16T10:59:13,18
I'm good for what's good for the goose it's good for the gander-you didn't even bring up the legacy media bias.    But yes either every president needs to be asked contentious questions that aren't pre screened or none of them do. The bullshit where the media worked as stenographers for Obama then suddenly cared about asking Trump hard questions is untenable.,hiricinee,2025-04-16T11:57:17,2
"You clearly didn't read the article.    >For many years, the independent White House Correspondents Association has run the pool for the limited space events, and each time it has included reporters from the wire services AP, Reuters and Bloomberg. One print reporter was also allowed, selected on a rotating basis from more than 30 news outlets. > >The White House now says it will lump the three wire services with print reporters for two slots — meaning roughly three dozen reporters will rotate for two regular slots. Wire services typically report and write stories that are used by different media outlets around the world. > >Even with the rotation, the White House said Trump’s press secretary “shall retain day-to-day discretion to determine composition of the pool.” The new policy says reporters will also be allowed in “irrespective of the substantive viewpoint expressed by an outlet.”  So this is the White House's version of complying with the court order to let the AP back in.  Instead of the AP, Bloomberg, and Reuters each getting a guaranteed spot, and then 30+ others doing a round-robin for the final spot - all 33+ will get fair access to 2 slots.    Only a liberal would say that equal access for all is unfair lol",JerseyKeebs,2025-04-16T10:55:25,34

"This.  I agreed with the suit the AP brought. Trump/the administration did a very Trump thing, and was clear that they were cut because of content of their speech.  That is a 1st Amendment violation.    But what isn't a 1st Amendment violation is taking questions from 20 news outlets that aren't the AP.  They could have also cut them to add another news agency because they wanted to change things up, and just stayed quiet about the real reason.",cathbadh,2025-04-16T11:55:40,10

"What in the 1st amendment gives the reporters the right to be in the White House? If he pulled their license, sure. But everyone is comparing apples to oranges. ",Reuters-no-bias-lol,2025-04-16T16:01:43,2

">What in the 1st amendment gives the reporters the right to be in the White House?  Nothing.  What they do have the right to is not to be punished for the content of their reporting, and this is well established in case law.  They were already a part of the press pool, and were removed specifically because their reporting upset the White House when the AP called it the Gulf of Mexico when Trump didn't want them to.  There are two scenarios to look at here:  1) Trump and the administration kicks the AP out because they want it called the Gulf of America and were angry that the AP wasn't obeying their demands.  2) Trump and the administration kicks the AP out because they want to fill their position with Buntluva69420 from the WeedNewz blog because it would ""increase reporting diversity.""  The first one is unconstitutional because it violates their First Amendment rights by punishing them for the content of their reporting.  The second one is not unconstitutional because it is a legitimate reason to make a change.  Literally all they had to do is use any reason but the one they publicly used, and the AP would have had no recourse.  Here's an imperfect analogy to illustrate.  A company has a 60 year old Director of Finance.  He makes a lot because he's been at the company for a long time, and if he stays until he's 65, they'll have to shell a whole bunch out in pension bonuses.  If they fire him because he's old, it is illegal.  Age is a protected class.  However, if they eliminate the Director of Finance position and let him go and then create a new Financing Manager position at lower pay with mildly different job responsibilities, it is completely legal.  The White House chose literally the only reason they shouldn't have chosen to do what they wanted to do.  Hell, they didn't have to even kick them out. Just leave them and never call on them.  Ever.  There would be no way to prove they were being punished.  Or take their question and just answer ""yes,"" or ""no,"" with zero elaboration.",cathbadh,2025-04-16T17:29:54,3

Punishing how? What are you on about? Are they preventing them from exercising free speech by not allowing them in the White House? I don't understand why everything is equated to free speech when it's not.,Reuters-no-bias-lol,2025-04-16T18:11:22,2
">Punishing how?  Cutting off access as a result of their legitimate use of their press freedom is absolutely a punishment.  NYT v US would be one example where the Supreme Court ruled as such as would Bauer V Shephard.  >What are you on about?  The Constitution.  Something we conservatives are supposed to care about.  >re they preventing them from exercising free speech by not allowing them in the White House?   That's not all that is covered, though.  Retaliation, even vague retaliation for expressing speech is impermissible.  >I don't understand why everything is equated to free speech when it's not.  Then I would suggest a civics course or two.  Personally, I don't understand the newfound hostility to constitutional rights among newer conservatives.",cathbadh,2025-04-16T19:39:45,1
