"it's pretty telling that Harvard took months to respond to accusations of antisemitism on campus (starting 10/08/23 - before Israel took any military action against Palestine - when dozens of students groups publicly supported Hamas), but when the federal dollar spigot is threatened, they take action within the week.      they assert they have a constitutional right to both run the school how they see fit *and* billions in taxpayer money. we'll see how it plays out.",bygonecenarion,2025-04-21T16:44:25,9
