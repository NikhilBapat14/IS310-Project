"""an FSU political science student by the name of Phoenix Ikner was quoted in [an article by FSUNews](https://www.fsunews.com/story/news/2025/01/19/sds-holds-march-down-legacy-walk-to-protest-trumps-agendatallahassee-sds-protests-trump-agenda-and-f/77756710007/) covering local protests of President Donald Trump’s agenda and FSU policies ahead of Trump’s inauguration.  “These people are usually pretty entertaining, usually not for good reasons,” the quote reads. “I think it’s a little too late, (Trump’s) already going to be inaugurated on Jan. 20, and there’s not really much you can do unless you outright revolt, and I don’t think anyone wants that""",Merax75,2025-04-17T17:15:10,66

"[https://www.wftv.com/](https://www.wftv.com/) \- cron says multiple dead.  I'm also seeing multiple sources reporting there was two shooters, with one of them in custody the other dead, but erroneous reports of multiple shooters early on is common.  So grain of salt on that.  Also seeing reports that that the captured shooter is one of the hospitalized.  Seems like all the live coverage as of now is just ""experts"" filling the time with fluff, platitudes and cliches while they wait for new information.",Stashan,2025-04-17T15:11:03,-8

Yup. Just another deranged kid. My fault for going on the usual media patterns. If he’s a straight white dude his name and picture is everywhere and if it’s anything but that it’s delayed and then buried.  Shoutout True Detective season 1 though.
