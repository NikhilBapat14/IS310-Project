"They ALL swore to support and defend the Constitution, judges, justices, and Congress. If they finally honor their sworn oath, Impeachment 3 should be the last one.",YallerDawg,2025-04-20T16:25:14,94

"I damn near think they're afraid to do it, because if he just ignores that, then what are they gonna do? It's not like they have a fucking personal army that's above everyone to just throw ppl in jail who don't comply",FickleSystem,2025-04-20T17:00:10,12

"People serving in the armed forces can be court martialed for obeying unlawful orders; the same should be true of these top level confirmed executive positions. I donâ€™t know what kind of law(s) would be necessary and maybe something like this already exists, but these people should be able to be hauled into court and essentially dishonorably discharged from government and potentially jailed. If they disobey courts, impeachment shouldnâ€™t be necessary; they should simply be removed from government.  Also moving forward, the bureaucracy and judiciary need better tools to actually defend themselves from something like this. I wonâ€™t pretend to have the answers, but they need to be able to reject or at least limit bad actors and incompetent people the Congress may thrust upon them. Yeah, sure these things are unlikely, but we should still talk about them.",notapoliticalalt,2025-04-20T22:38:39,9
"It gets no better the further down you go in the line of succession, and part of me thinks their agenda will be carried out regardless of who is in charge  I hope I'm wrong, but were they both removed, nothing really changes unless Dems had already taken back the House",Beer-Me,2025-04-20T17:10:41,15

Taking back the house will be the only way to get a Democrat into the line of succession.,JoviAMP,2025-04-20T17:20:06,12
Exactly. Thereâ€™s a never ending line of people like Trump just waiting for their turn on the throne.,Significant_Camp9024,2025-04-21T06:40:14,2
