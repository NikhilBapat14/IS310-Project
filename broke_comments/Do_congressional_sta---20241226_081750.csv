"when congress is in session, they wear full business attire (suits ties, etc) when congress is out of session, they wear business casual to really casual depending on the office. I worked there for 22 years so i'm very familiar with keeping tabs on the schedule to make sure i don't underdress on a day in session. You can get away with business casual on fly-in and fly-out days sometimes.
