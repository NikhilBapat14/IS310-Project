American kids don't need fresh fruit and vegetables in school lunches; not when the billionaires need a tax cut,DefiantCommand4357,2025-04-24T11:22:42,6

"It is such a shame that this decision hasn't been reversed by now. I was so upset when I first heard about it. Unfortunately, nothing has changed. Food banks and small farms all over the country are still negatively affected by these cuts.  And there was no reason to do this!! There's no benefit. This decision hurts people and there's no positive result that comes from it.  But of course, trump and musk are fine, because they never have to worry about not being able to afford food. They don't care that other people are going hungry, because they're totally fine and have plenty of money. So they have no problem causing others to starve.",sachiprecious,2025-04-24T11:59:37,4
