"> The Armenian National Committee of America (ANCA) sharply condemns President Donald Trump’s shameful retreat from American recognition and remembrance of the Armenian Genocide, as reflected in his refusal, under Turkish pressure, to even mention the Armenian Genocide by name in the White House’s annual April 24th statement marking the 110th anniversary of the Ottoman Turkish Government’s systematic annihilation of 1.5 million Armenians.  > “President Trump’s retreat from U.S. recognition of the Armenian Genocide represents a disgraceful surrender to Turkish threats—a shameful abrogation of our nation’s responsibility to prevent Azerbaijan and Turkey’s ongoing genocidal aggression against Christian Armenians”.  > “Following Azerbaijan’s ethnic cleansing of Artsakh’s indigenous Christian Armenian population, and amid its ongoing abuse of Armenian prisoners, destruction of Armenian Christian heritage and occupation of sovereign Armenia—President Trump has a duty to not only honestly and truthfully acknowledge the 1915 Armenian Genocide, but prevent its continuation at the hands of Turkey and Azerbaijan”.",1DarkStarryNight,2025-04-24T14:42:42,8

I'm running out of room on my 1400 page notebook of reasons why Trump is a POS,JustJelly2323,2025-04-24T19:10:23,1
he probably doesnt care about genocide or places that wont bow to him,saiyanscaris,2025-04-24T16:44:30,1
No doubt Trump has some sort of real estate deal he is working on in Turkey.   Or maybe the Turks just bought a bunch of bitcoins from him....   Nothing the US government does is not for sale under Trump.,Beantown-Jack,2025-04-24T14:47:53,3
And there are a lot of Armenian Americans that worship trump now. I guess they now have to choose over their deeply rooted heritage that has shaped their families or some orange shitstain with dementia who loves turkey and genocide and is actively involved in deportations. ,Designer-Contract852,2025-04-24T14:47:54,3
"If/When he is presented with a choice between doing the right thing and siding with tyrants/tyranny, Trump will (almost!) always choose siding with tyrants/tyranny. The guy DESPERATELY wants to be liked by the absolute worst kinds of people. And it's pretty sad seeing the supposed ""leader of the free world"" siding with tyrants and authoritarians. Can't say it enough.",HappyMike91,2025-04-24T14:45:36,2

"Considering how hard Eric Adams was sucking off the Turks, and how hard he's currently sucking off Trump, it makes perfect sense.",TheTeenageOldman,2025-04-24T14:52:38,2
You probably would want Biden that obsessed with helenism and Antiturkism. US president must be natural antiturkist. I love this backward racism against Turks. Always funny,alpguvenn,2025-04-24T20:07:42,1
It is not ”backward racism” against Germany to acknowledge that Germany committed genocide against Jews.  It is not “backward racism” against America to acknowledge that America engaged in genocide and ethnic cleansing against indigenous people in America.  And it is not “backward racism“ against Turkey to acknowledge that Turkey engaged in genocide against Armenians.  It is a simple fact of history.,Beantown-Jack,2025-04-24T21:04:34,1
"I'm implying ""helenism""  as backward racism. Which Biden openly admit it. Which is clearly antiturkist approach. You know, Turks have Constantinople etc.   You should really check your ability to understanding  what you read",alpguvenn,2025-04-24T21:11:06,1
