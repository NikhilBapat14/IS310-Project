"Non paywalled gift link. Excerpt:  > Explaining what President Trump really wants has become a thriving industry in its own right, often proved wrong as soon as it is published. Two things are clear about his tariff policy, however: He wants a lower trade deficit and he wants investment to rebuild U.S. manufacturing. True believers who think he might achieve those goals should think through what else has to happen as a result.  > The starting point is the balance of payments, the broadest measure of trade and investment in and out of the economy. Its two sides have to balance: the current account, which tallies up trade flows and some other stuff not worth getting into; and the capital and financial accounts, which measure, well, capital and money flowing in and out to buy things such as stocks and bonds and investments in factories.  > For years, Americans have imported way more than they exported, thus the trade deficit in the current-account part of the equation. For the balance of payments to balance, there needs to be a corresponding inflow of capital. That has largely come from foreigners buying assets, most prominently stocks and government debt in the form of Treasurys.  > Trump’s plan will disrupt that dynamic. Smaller trade deficits mean smaller inflows of capital.",nosotros_road_sodium,2025-04-21T22:34:16,10
