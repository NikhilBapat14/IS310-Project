"I sense another summer of violence if this pos is sentenced, and he should.",frostyfire1990,2025-04-18T09:22:41,78
"You know “injustice!!!” riots will break out if Karmelo is found guilty and sentenced. No doubts, even when he openly admitted to doing it.  The left drools after, and loves to praise and uphold criminals and murderers.",ITrCool,2025-04-18T08:43:07,59
Purposeful agitation in a local level. They really don't even care what happens to Anthony because any outcome will be beneficial.,triggernaut,2025-04-18T08:39:35,30
"Frisco should be pretty fair when prosecuting this case once it goes to trial. Demographics are 50% white, 30% asian and about 10% black. It also generally leans more conservative.",TheConvincingSavant,2025-04-18T08:53:02,16
"Indeed, and all to ultimately fuel hate against conservatives and Trump.",Panzershrekt,2025-04-18T09:54:58,34
"Now, now, just because the Dear Leader is gone we still need to be careful with potentially ""hurtful speech"". I'm certain that you meant to say another ""summer of love""!",New_Ant_7190,2025-04-18T12:05:46,3
">The left drools after, and loves to praise and uphold criminals and murderers.  ONLY when they’re black. That’s key. No other race gets this treatments from liberal whites not Hispanics, not natives, certainly not Asians. It’s reached a creepy fetishy infantilizy point.",Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-04-18T10:20:42,30
"Actually this is in Collin County and the jury pool, if there is a trial, will be drawn from the entire county.",New_Ant_7190,2025-04-18T12:09:34,3
"Unfortunately I don't see how we can avoid this. Not for another generation. The left is best when it comes to racial/class divide, nobody does it better than they do. What we achieved in November was good, but not enough to swing the pendulum back for a certain demographic.",frostyfire1990,2025-04-18T10:28:35,20
Other races do if they're immigrants.,Jonathan-Strang3,2025-04-18T20:27:41,2
"The demographics are roughly the same. Overall, Collin County has a smaller asian population than Frisco.",TheConvincingSavant,2025-04-22T08:46:58,2
"You're right. We likely won't be able to have normal political discourse in this country for *at least* a generation, if ever. Many people here might believe it's possible to start moving back towards that with Vance or DeSantis in 2028, but then I'm reminded of how the mudslinging and lying was starting to get bad in 2008 against McCain and Paul Ryan.",Panzershrekt,2025-04-18T11:25:00,6
Their side fights tribal warfare while our side goes to work to pay taxes.,D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-18T11:38:05,3
Not that it should impact a jury pool but I wonder if there is a trial would it be at the courthouse in McKinney or the justice center on Hwy 75.,New_Ant_7190,2025-04-22T09:06:13,2
The left isn't going to give up their hate addiction just because Trump retires - it'll be a manufactured shitstorm on day one for the new guy and it'll be the same old dirty tricks as before.,D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-18T11:40:20,6
