Mfer hosting Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon on his podcast acting like it's Democrats who are unrecognizable.  This guy has slicked back hair.,Pike_Gordon,2025-04-22T10:40:21,48
"While I will say that Newsom has been rubbing me the wrong way lately...  I will say what I want in the party platform.  * Fight against Citizens United - Corps are not people * Treat all people with fairness and respect. * Support Ukraine and free people everywhere. * Sensible Gun laws * Healthcare as a basic human right * Reign in, out of control, business and billionaire loopholes * Remove most money in elections (possible taxes pay for equal campaign runs.) Bring it back to the policies. * Remove elected officials ability to participate in stock trading.  That would be my starters. Though I probably missed some, if so i'll try to add later.",Idredric,2025-04-22T10:41:51,15
"I used to think Newsom may be the future of the party. A future I didn't particularly relish, a 'centrist' future, a future a lot of people would hold their nose and support, but a future nonetheless.  I don't think that anymore. I think he's becoming just another establishment cog too scared to face the moment and embrace the change the party clearly needs. The sooner we stop giving people like him and the old guard any air, the better.",HarwellDekatron,2025-04-22T10:58:24,16
Yeah hard pass on Newsom thanks. Stinks of Mitt Romney and Feinstein and Pelosi and Bannon and Simena too.,Spare_Philosopher893,2025-04-22T10:48:33,11
Because of neo-lib bitches like you Gavin. Fucking snakeoil salesman. Democratic party needs to ditch all the chameleons and go back to being a party of progress and strong labor.,letsago9987,2025-04-22T11:03:09,9

Because you're one of the old school republicans before they jumped the shark- the ones that could pass for democrats in California and enough of the electorate were dumb enough to fall for it while you broke Covid curfew to enjoy your maskless fine dining outings.,SoupSpelunker,2025-04-22T10:55:48,5
"I was a lifelong moderate democrat.  Had no use for Bernie or AOC. But a combination of the slick ""finger in the wind"" politics of Newsom types combined with the absolute horror show of what the GOP has become has driven me way to the left of where I was. Bernie and AOC and maybe a few others are speaking out. The rest of the dems are overthinking this. Do the right thing; don't worry about the polls.",Kincherk,2025-04-22T11:05:59,5
I demand a temporary ban on Newsom and Carville posts until we can figure out what the hell is going on.,Lindy2026,2025-04-22T11:15:20,6
Well get on a plane Newsom and go to the Next fighting the oligarchy rally and watch. Thats the future,sedatedlife,2025-04-22T10:43:59,11
He can't believe there are Progressive ideas getting traction. Newsom is what you get if you ask Google AI to define a democratic candidate.,williamgman,2025-04-22T11:02:19,5
He's a dream candidate for the Third Way. He's from California so people will think he's progressive when he is actually to the right of the centrists who currently control the party. If he was in the Senate he would have been another Manchin. It's only a matter of time before he uses the term woke as a pejorative.,red23011,2025-04-22T11:06:44,4
"In other words, I don't know what to say to get you to vote for me.  These people won't just say what they think. Every word out of their mouths is analyzed to get as many voters as possible. It isn't about ideas and making the world a better place. It is about staying in power and getting MORE power.",SatoriFound70,2025-04-22T10:52:17,3

Never trust a politician whose hair is a major part of his personality. ,FriendlyGuy77,2025-04-22T11:27:02,3
I say this as  a California Democrat:  Newsom is turning right in the hope of getting elected President.  He has no actual beliefs.,FormerUsenetUser,2025-04-22T12:48:51,3
"It's delusional and disingenuous.  The party is absolutely convinced it is serving voters' interests, when it is really only preserving itself (and doing a bad job of that).  It's base is donors, not constituents.  This is what 30 years of Third Way got them.  Most voters can't consciously put their finger on this, but they can smell it, faintly.  Meanwhile the GOP is peddling poisoned candy.  Kamala lost because her platform came from a spreadsheet, not from reality.  Obama won because his team knew that hope counters fear.  Democrats need to rediscover what they were before Clinton.",Caraes_Naur,2025-04-22T12:00:05,2

">Newsom told reporters last week Abrego Garcia’s case was the “distraction of the day,” suggesting the Trump administration has pushed for Americans to focus on it “because they don’t want this debate on tariffs,” adding the GOP doesn’t want “to be accountable to markets today.”  Calling due process a distraction and licking all the worst of conservatives balls on his podcast have made it very clear he doesn’t know the party. He was called out about his comments and is now working overtime to “cares” about due process. The last thing we need more craven politicians that only in the fight the good fight for personal gain. Keep it moving bastard.",ChickpeaDemon,2025-04-22T13:42:42,1

"> ""Support"" Ukraine and free people everywhere.    Obviously the best way to do this is for the planet's #1 and #2 most murderous nations in history to quash peace negotiations which would at worst see administration of some land change with little disruption to anyone's lives - better to blow it up alongside dozens of urban areas built environments, flood the most virulent extremists in the zone with weapons to cynically get tens of thousands more killed and displace hundreds of thousands more. All to ensure better business opportunities for oligarchs.",whatareyousomekinda,2025-04-22T10:50:00,-5
they aren’t necessarily overthinking. It’s very possible they are bought and funded by those who won’t benefit from pro working class policies that the democratic party has refused to adopt wholeheartedly. They may know what is needed but be corrupted to the point they would rather see america crumble than piss off their donors.  edit: letter,LongLiveFDR,2025-04-22T11:17:04,5
