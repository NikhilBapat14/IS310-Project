Just drop the infinity +1 tariff already and start the momma jokes culminating in a combo wedgie and swirlie.,SeemoarAlpha,2025-04-15T23:35:15,780
Eventually the number loses its meaning bc the product isn’t reasonably competitive. Why not just say embargo and pull the bandaid?,philthy069,2025-04-16T00:13:53,629
"The U.S. is in a stronger position on paper, but the Chinese have time on their side.  They can suffer a long time. Trump has at most months to show results.",LemartesIX,2025-04-16T09:11:45,146
Yeah okay until this goes away in 2 weeks or less. This is getting real old real fast. Why not just make it a full embargo or eleventy gorillion % ?,anima201,2025-04-16T07:32:52,182
Last time this didn't include electronics. Is that still the case?,Hectoriu,2025-04-15T23:40:00,128
Country made of exports vs country that buys them because it’s “cheap”   Wonder who will win…,ExpertCatJuggler,2025-04-15T23:59:11,241
Lets just do a full embargo already,Delicious_Physics_74,2025-04-16T00:25:26,63
We haven't  even begun to reach our threshold yet. Keep it up and quit buying cheap ass shit made in China.,Wide_Fig3130,2025-04-15T23:32:36,78
I really hope this keeps up and we fully separate from buying Chinese shit. Their economy is ruined if we don’t buy from them.,RadiantWhole2119,2025-04-16T06:24:12,45
"Honestly, the EO here is absolutely justified. For far too long we have relied on China and it is a massive national security risk IMO",Enchylada,2025-04-16T00:47:46,40
I hope they start driving home the point that when democrats scream this is catastrophic to America... then you see the problem... China has absolute control over our nation and at any time can pull the rug out.   China has been strategically building this trade imbalance and military powers for a couple decades and it has only accelerated under Biden. There was inevitably going to be a point when China flipped the switch and used their massive leverage- Trump stepped in before they could.,BarrelStrawberry,2025-04-16T07:26:34,15
"I voted for it and I’m here for it.  Thankfully, I don’t have the spending habits that would increase my day to day spending anyway.     Cut out your own wasteful spending and buy domestic, Japanese, German when possible (something that will last) and you can also feel free to ignore most of this China/tariff stuff.",Narrow-Trash-8839,2025-04-16T10:44:21,6
China needs the US more than the US needs China.  They will have to fold eventually.,Merax75,2025-04-16T00:08:27,-3

Trump just ended the Chinese Century and you're blackpilling?,Highwiind-D4,2025-04-16T02:27:35,-27
It lost meaning around the 125% mark. No be is going to buy past that.,cathbadh,2025-04-16T09:29:35,95
"We’re obviously still hoping for a negotiation. Yeah, we *could* just have an embargo, but then you’d have to answer why we would. Feels like it probably works out better to rip the bandaid off slowly from an economic perspective if China really isn’t caving anytime soon.",Vile-The-Terrible,2025-04-16T06:34:40,48
"Most countries tariffs only go to 10 gorillion.  But where can you go from there?  If we need that extra push over the cliff, our tariffs can go to 11!",srbrega,2025-04-16T14:18:37,3
"Should be yeah, they arent subject to the retaliatory portion of the tarrifs  So they are at 20% possibly 30%",ultrainstict,2025-04-16T00:17:38,45
It's honestly sad how many people think that the CCP actually have leverage on the US,spezeditedcomments,2025-04-16T00:09:43,-86

I hate buying Chinese crap. I would rather buy from any other country if I can't get it in the US,pdawg43,2025-04-16T09:11:56,24
"Hell, there's been bipartisan complaints about everything being outsourced to china.  The labor union guys on the left and the people who actually care about human rights as well.  But you know, Orange Man Bad, so the left has to go full pro-Chicom.",ObadiahtheSlim,2025-04-16T09:54:16,21
That's the point. This seems like posturing to me and suggests there could potentially be ulterior motives at play.,philthy069,2025-04-16T09:37:33,28
Thank you for your response. Do you think it is possible our administration has other ancillary motives beyond negotiating more favorable trade?,philthy069,2025-04-16T08:10:21,25
Only reason they would is because the CCP is a one party state so they are more likely to wait it out meanwhile Trump and the GOP can’t really wait it out because they need public support.,InAingeWeTrust,2025-04-16T08:36:39,82

Who?  Where are they’re factories and supply chains?  Do they have any infrastructure in place to provide that?   No…no they don’t .,djc_tech,2025-04-16T10:15:43,92
Most of the stuff you buy is still made there,djc_tech,2025-04-16T10:16:02,84
"Depends on how things go. There's no doubt in my mind that the administration wants China to come to the table and negotiate. Status quo remains, we get a better trade agreement, and maybe we can actually hold China to their promises unlike the past. However, if China does not come to the table, the idea is to bring jobs back to the US. This is less ideal short term for multiple reasons. The worst part would be that you would see many items increase in price dramatically. Even long term, we may not equalize to what we were. The administration definitely doesn't want to go this route as they may lose the faith of the American public and we could lose the house/senate in the upcoming elections. Then in 2028, we go back to the status quo where China gets away with murder.",Vile-The-Terrible,2025-04-16T18:19:28,8
"They are rapidly burning cash and just burned a ton with belts and roads, which is a long term strat and puts them in more of a crunch now.    They cannot not export for cash, it keeps their country operating",spezeditedcomments,2025-04-16T08:53:15,3
We may not have the leverage we think. Lots of American companies have operations there; they can”t just move the manufacturing in a day.,indiginary,2025-04-16T20:39:22,13
"No one is claiming we can move manufacturing in a day. This is why prices would increase dramatically in the short term. Supply would cease making items previously made in China scarce and expensive. American companies would fill the void eventually, but to build that manufacturing infrastructure is going to take a heap of investment and labor.",Vile-The-Terrible,2025-04-16T21:20:17,5
"I know. Any transition would take potentially decades and these tariffs are assuming it’d be immediate. Our economy is intertwined with China’s and this is damaging relations to the point where US manufacturers who operate there will be hurt badly. There appears to be no fallback plan, and neither side is blinking. Our power in influencing China is overestimated.   I hope I am wrong.",indiginary,2025-04-17T01:00:56,3
And do you think Trump will invest in that infra (and labour - paying people) to make that a possibility?,Alone-Set-4067,2025-04-17T19:56:16,2
"So we don't have reliable data on China's economy or the general state of the country as they're extremely authoritarian. There is no doubt in my mind that the US is in a stronger position than China. However, what matters is how much. Overall I'm on board with the overall strategy. Here's hoping Trump made a good bet and it pays off. If it doesn't then we're back to the status quo in 2028 minimum.",Vile-The-Terrible,2025-04-17T20:58:12,1
"Trump is very pro America. He's already talked about incentivizing businesses bringing manufacturing back home and lessening regulations to make the barrier to entry easier. However, based on the tone of your comment, I'm assuming you would want nothing short of the government completely bankrolling it which is ludicrous.",Vile-The-Terrible,2025-04-17T21:00:03,0
