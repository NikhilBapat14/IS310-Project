And he's still going on about Fentanyl. I have a weird feeling he has his own brand of Fentanyl and that's why he's making such a big about it coming in from other countries.,jtsa5,2025-04-23T13:22:06,9
Its still a massive tax hike if the numbers ive seen floated around are true and really just shows China has the upper hand   If china didn't blink at 145% I doubt dropping them lower with no concessions or even trade conversations will make them change their mind and just makes Trump look like a dumbass and weak,blues111,2025-04-23T13:22:27,7

Moron only accomplished giving China a W and America the most embarrassing global L of my life.  Conservatives should be besides themselves at this failure.  This Hippo has no teeth on the global stage.,hous26,2025-04-23T13:22:50,3

Let's all be 100% true here. He isn't doing it cause China retaliated or people complained. He did it cause his billionaire friends are upset with him.,Brave-Algae-3072,2025-04-23T14:42:47,2
I’d love to hear a perfectly articulated reason of why the sudden change of heart. It seemed like China was perfectly ok with fighting a trade war so why Mr orange?,PorQuePanckes,2025-04-23T15:04:14,2
