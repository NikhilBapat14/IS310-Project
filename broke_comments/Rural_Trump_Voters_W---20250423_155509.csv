"Sorry, but I'm over this ""Democrats are responsible for everything, and Republicans have no agency"" bullshit.  They aren't going to come around or change parties.  It's a deeply-rooted ideological problem and it doesn't matter how shitty the GOP acts, since they've established a cycle of abuse with their voter base who *always* comes crawling back and ready to spit on the Democrats.  Just like the world is routing around the US now, we need to route around them.  We can't fix them since they don't want to be fixed.

Bullshit. Democrats do fight for rural voters; the Biden administration did more for them than any in the last 40 years. Rural voters are in an extremely controlled information bubble.

"There is an excellent book from 1955 that interviews 10 everyday Germans who lived through the Nazi rise and regime. These people looked back at Hitler fondly and felt he increased their individual freedom. They were cabinet makers, bakers, teachers, accountants etc. Your friends and neighbors. This book made me realize that MAGA is never waking up and to wait for it is foolish.

Are you talking about the ones that proudly proclaimed that they would rather be a Russian than a democrat. The farmers that lose their farms will still support trump and have stated that repeatedly.

"There's some truth to the strategy though. These people exist off of vibes. We need fight, we need attitude, we need name calling. We need real people who act like real people who throw verbal punches, shit on the opposition and talk about all the ways we will make their lives better.  We need to actually acknowledge them and some of their grievances and then show them who to blame.  Democrats are NOT doing enough to support rural communities. Or even recognize them.   We need main character energy and we need to make bad guys of the actual bad guys.  Simply having the better scholarly argument isn't enough. Decorum is offensive.  Going high is weak.

"The dems usually start the culture wars by publicly filing lawsuits that involve a small percentage of oppressed people. The trans bathroom issues and the trans sports issue are two examples. The republicans then jump on these issues and dems overreact and it make the dems look insane. I played competitive sports for over 30 years and  have 1 child of each sex, The way the dems have approached this issue is insane. There is no way a trans man should be allowed to compete in women sports. It is unfair and playing by the same rules has always been at the heart of sports. This issue affect less than 1000 people but lost the democrats many times more than that. The last thing people wanted to hears about was this shit while they are trying to make their house or car payment. My daughter is LGBTQ, i hate racist, and am not a bigot, but as long as this is what the dems harp on  the more elections they will lose. There is a large group of swing voters in this country who do not vote on the culture wars and the far left is so stupid that if you do not make these culture wars the main topic they will vote third party or not vote. Their actions are the reason for trump 2 election wins. Now they come on here and try to blame the dems. they are as bad as the magats.",Loud_Badger_3780,2025-04-23T23:58:12,-3

"Exactly. ""Fight for them"" in this case means, ""Throw the marginalized groups that have supported Democrats for decades under the bus.""  Labour is doing that in the UK and, instead of gaining support from Tories, their own supporters (including some pretty prolific ones) are turning against them. Not only that, but the voters they're kowtowing to are suddenly shocked that policies they've pushed for and Labour is implementing, like cutting benefits, means their benefits would be cut as well.",Subliminal_Kiddo,2025-04-23T16:59:46,8
