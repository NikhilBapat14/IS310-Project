What's there to investigate after 24 years?,Alpha-Sierra-Charlie,2025-04-22T17:52:58,26
No  Just…  No.,cliffotn,2025-04-22T18:17:56,21
I'd like an answer for that also..a truthful one.,martel197,2025-04-22T18:50:46,9
There was a 911 commission and a report too. Most of that was hidden away from what I remember.,Whole-Essay640,2025-04-23T07:37:45,1
"Good! It's crazy after this long the truth about it hasn't been released. It's clear that the building was demolished as it barely had any damage to collapse and yet it fell at free fall speed despite not being hit by a plane, which was the ""reasoning"" the other two towers fell.    Just compare it to hundreds of videos of controlled demolitions, listen to the countless demolition experts, and if you still can't believe it despite the command to ""pull it"" then you're a lost cause.",MeLlamoKilo,2025-04-22T18:33:08,-8
"I think there were a lot of odd things that happened that day (and days prior).  But an investigation will not lead to new truths.  Just like it hasn’t with UFOs, JFK, and lots of other stuff.",Narrow-Trash-8839,2025-04-22T22:25:18,0
"Alright, hear me out. Release the entire investigation unredacted without ANY investigations or hearings. Stop wasting our time on hearings and start legislating Trump's agenda while we have the majority.",RyanLJacobsen,2025-04-22T20:07:24,-2
"""Sen. Ron Johnson's (R-Wisc.) answer:    Well, start with Building 7. Again, I don’t know if you can find structural engineers other than the ones that have the corrupt investigations inside NIST that would say that that thing didn’t come down in any other way than a controlled demolition… You just look at that…   There’s an awful lot of questions. Who ordered the removal and the destruction of all that evidence? Totally contrary to any other firefighting investigation procedures. I mean, who ordered that? Who is in charge? I think there’s some basic information. Where’s all the documentation from the NIST investigation.  Now, there are a host of questions that I want and I will be asking, quite honestly, now that my eyes have been opened up.""",Ironman650,2025-04-22T17:50:08,-9
Ron Johnson says he thinks Senate could hold hearings on 9/11 conspiracies  https://www.aol.com/news/ron-johnson-says-thinks-senate-192103455.html,Ironman650,2025-04-22T17:49:32,-11
We were busy chasing around “wmd’s” in Iraq.,DandierChip,2025-04-22T18:29:22,9
They lied to you about everything.  What makes you think they won't lie to you about this?  What harm can  another investigation do?,Ironman650,2025-04-22T19:40:39,-7
And how will you know it's truthful? Or is it only going to be truthful if it confirms what you already believe?,JustinCayce,2025-04-22T21:54:42,9
That doesn't change the fact that any trail has almost certainly gone cold *and* been thoroughly covered up. IF it was there in the first place.,Alpha-Sierra-Charlie,2025-04-22T18:33:56,10
"Millions/billions of dollars spent on another investigation that leads to no tangible outcome. Whether 9/11 was an inside job or not is practically irrelevant unless one, you can *without any doubt whatsoever* prove that it was and two, you can *enact justice on the guilty*.  If anyone is guilty, they're too well insulated by a quarter of a century and institutional complicity for either of those two things to happen. Let's see an unredacted guest list to Epstein's rape island and some convictions from it, or something similar, and I may walk that back.",Alpha-Sierra-Charlie,2025-04-22T20:14:51,10
There was a full 9-11 commission report released already.  We do not need to spend another dime on this.,Lustan,2025-04-23T15:11:22,-1
