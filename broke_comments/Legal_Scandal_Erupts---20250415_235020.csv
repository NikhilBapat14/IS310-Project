">According to Benz, these initiatives are framed as foreign aid or democracy promotion but serve to standardize legal systems worldwide in a way that benefits U.S. government interests, **global NGOs,** and corporate partners.  The NGO's are good at laundering government money.  The EU alone is equal to or more than the US in GDP - if all the EU countries pooled their economies.  I'm sure there is European NGO graft and corruption there too.",GiediOne,2025-04-16T00:24:28,8
This is obvious to anyone with eyes. The legal system has been filled with far left globalists. There is a reason illegal immigration has been a problem for so long. It prints money for lawyers taken from taxpayers.,kaytin911,2025-04-16T05:33:40,7
