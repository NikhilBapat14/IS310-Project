The company's profit will still tank as [most people have a negative view of Tesla and Musk; and that negative sentiment is still growing](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/22/about-half-of-americans-have-a-negative-view-on-tesla-and-elon-musk-cnbc-survey-finds.html).   ![gif](giphy|xT5LMHkEg6runrYJuo),progress18,2025-04-22T17:40:41,86

"Article snippet:   > Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive, said on Tuesday that he would spend less time in Washington working for President Trump after the automaker reported a profit drop of 71 percent in the first three months of the year. >  > Mr. Musk told Wall Street analysts in a conference call that he would continue to spend “a day or two per week” on Washington matters, probably for the duration of Mr. Trump’s presidency. The billionaire executive is one of Mr. Trump’s closest confidants and has played a leading role in the president’s efforts to slash government spending and cut tens of thousands of federal government jobs. >  > His comments came less than two hours after Tesla said it had earned $409 million, down from $1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2024. The company previously reported net profit of $1.1 billion last year, but revised the figure to reflect changes in the way cryptocurrency assets are valued. >  > Tesla sales have been slumping because of intense competition from Chinese carmakers like BYD, a lack of new models and Mr. Musk’s support of far-right causes, which has turned off some liberals and centrists from buying Tesla vehicles.",progress18,2025-04-22T17:33:10,14

"Musk's contributions   Federal Workforce - Over 200,000 layoffs, agency   Dismantling Social Services-Reduced access, longer wait times, office closures  Fiscal Impact	- Limited savings, increased deficit due to lost tax revenue  Global Impact - 	Potentially dire effects on international aid and global partnerships   Musk’s DOGE Program gave us  DOGE claims about $150 billion in government spending cuts.  Lost Tax Revenue: Cuts to the IRS are projected to cause over $500 billion per year in lost tax revenue—potentially $2 trillion or more over a decade.
