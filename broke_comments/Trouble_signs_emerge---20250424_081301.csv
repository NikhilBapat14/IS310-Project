">“If the neighborhood pizza place your family had been visiting every week started putting kale in the crust, you’d expect to see some customer dissatisfaction.”   The customers at this right-wing pizza place are these very large super donors who love this very unpopular Heritage foundation Project 2025 agenda that very few Americans thinking straight want anything to do with. Their agenda is so very unpopular that the Trump campaign even had to completely lie to the American people about this Project 2025 - which has one of the lyingest campaigns that they've ever ever seen and has a history of flagrantly misleading and deceiving their supporters even with their associates related fundraisers.   And these very large super donors who love this very unpopular Project 2025 agenda that mirrors what the Trump administration is pushing have a lot of money they invested for very cheap in foreign countries (and very goofy things like cryptocurrency) and they don't want to see America succeed because if America doesn't succeed their foreign investments will be worth a lot more and their terrible American agenda will be very profitable for their foreign monopolies",postsshortcomments,2025-04-24T08:35:20,2
