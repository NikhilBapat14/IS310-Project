"An excerpt from the article, because the title doesn't show *just* how batshit crazy this is.   >A group of eight Republicans in the Minnesota House have introduced legislation (HF3219) that would designate certain vaccines and medical treatments as ‚Äúweapons of mass destruction‚Äù and make possessing or administering them a crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison.  >The legislation specifically targets messenger RNA (mRNA) treatments, which include several COVID-19 vaccines. Those vaccines have saved millions of lives and are considered one of the most important medical and public health achievements of the 21st century so far.  >The bill‚Äôs language appears to have been drafted by Joseph Sansone, a Florida hypnotist and conspiracy theorist who believes that mRNA treatments are ‚Äúnanoparticle injections‚Äù that amount to ‚Äúbiological and technological weapons of mass destruction.‚Äù   >Sansone has falsely claimed that ‚Äúmore Americans have died from mRNA injections than in WWI, WWII, and the Vietnam War combined,‚Äù and has said he has stood ‚Äúalongside an Army of the Dead‚Äù to file unsuccessful legal complaints against vaccines in Florida.",Cat_herder_81,2025-04-22T16:36:16,73
