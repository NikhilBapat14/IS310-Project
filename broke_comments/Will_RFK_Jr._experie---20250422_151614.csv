"As someone with Autism and with at least one child who is also affected, this is deeply upsetting to me.   I've spent a good portion of my life dealing with these bullshit negative stereotypes. I'm a productive citizen. I've been employed all my adult life. I hold 3 bachelors, a masters, have some credits towards a PhD, and recently began a career transition by starting law school. I own and operate 2 small businesses. And you know what all that means? I've paid a whole hell of a lot in taxes. If I can do all that, I can certainly use the toilet.   It's a gross generalization and mischaracterization. I want my kids to grow up in a world that accepts them rather than makes assumptions about them.   I'm more divided with my family over RFK than over Trump. They at least recognize some of the nonsense from Trump",Brickscratcher,2025-04-24T13:42:50,1

"No.  The key to all of their concerns about Autism is that it is something that *they* caused in their children. These are loving parents, at their core, who are terrified that they have somehow cursed their child to a life of living less-than a 'normal person'. That's how they frame Autism in their minds: its not merely a way that some people are, it's a condition that otherises and diminishes an individuals ability to live a normal and well-adjusted life. Every parent wants to do everything in their power to raise their children to be healthy, whole, and well-adjusted so that they can succeed in life and find happiness and be independent so no parent would willingly want to feed their children substances that they thought would harm their well-being, to subject them to an environmental factor that would make them unwell or even alter their bodies.   Lastly because Autism is an otherising debilitating condition (they think), and they are physically and/or mentally normal (they believe), then having an Autistic child means something caused that (they conclude), something is to blame, and they want reassurance that it wasn't their fault. They want someone to tell them that their Child isn't mental broken and fucked up for life because of something They did, and to an extent that includes deciding to have a child and it turns out to be a product of genetics. They want to blame something, they want to be able to point at the problem and keep their children safe from it. You can't do that if its just something You're born as, in fact that makes it worse because then (in the way they think) it is entirely Their fault.",Fofolito,2025-04-24T09:26:17,1

"The families of people with autism that are high-functioning are probably not part of his constituency.  The families of people with severe, disabling autism probably don't think he characterized the population inaccurately.  You know how people call the urge to clean small messes or straighten stacks of paper as OCD, even though they're not diagnosed? Have you ever heard a person with diagnosed OCD get upset about it, saying something to the effect of ""I actually have OCD and I have to wash my hands until they're completely raw because I can't stop thinking about the way everything outside of my house is covered in a thin layer of AIDS semen?""  I think the same thing is happening with autism, but the ""annoyed by misaligned papers"" guy is actually diagnosed as well. ""Awkward guy who is way more into trains than is normal"" and ""guy who screams if he thinks about touching something made of wool"" are both diagnosed with autism, but the family that has to take care of their 30 year old autistic child because they can't even feed themselves isn't going to feel like the guy who introduces himself by talking about his recent fascination with legos has ""real"" autism.  I don't think the families of people who turn out to be socially awkward bioengineers with an obsession with telescopes are that concerned with finding a cause or cure for autism, and there's a good chance they're going to be against it, and there's a good chance they already didn't like RFK Jr.  The families with disabled autistic children probably very much want to find a cause and cure, probably supported RFK Jr., and probably don't see any problem with any of his recent statements.",lakotajames,2025-04-24T08:44:27,1

He describes children with autism as destroyed, defective - not really people at all, just a drain on everyone else.

"""But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes. That’s the difficulty.

But of course this isn’t the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.

"And? The other person said that RFK ""already said"" that they'd be sent to a farm camp. He did not say that. He said something else that was entirely stupid but unrelated. If you want to make the argument that ""if he's willing to send people with ADHD and depression to farm camps, he'd be willing to do the same with people with autism"" then make that argument, but that's not what he said and is unnecessarily alarmist (when there's already enough to be sufficiently alarmist about) to claim that it was. The incredibly stupid ""point"" of his work camp idea was to detox people from their ""drug addition"", which is not something you could do for people with autism. If he has such a condescending view of people with autism's abilities (""they can't even use a toilet by themselves""), why would he send them to do physical labor?",trace349,2025-04-24T11:00:00,1
"> why exactly should we give this horrifying rhetoric the benefit of the doubt that it's purely coincidental?  The man has literally had *parts of his brain* **eaten by worms**. [He didn't have enough time to _strip and store the meat from **a roadkill bear carcass** for consumption_ so instead he dropped it in Central Park in the dead of night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oAjaACI4E0). Under those circumstances, I think we should default to ""moron"" or ""insane idiot"" rather than ""eugenicist mastermind"".",trace349,2025-04-24T15:05:40,1
"Ah yes, his idiocy in Samoa is ""for his own entertainment.""  Seriously, this isn't a reasonable take.",ClockOfTheLongNow,2025-04-24T13:08:43,1
"I don't think he's uneducated, I think his education is outdated. The autism that he's referring to hasn't changed, but the word autism includes more than when he learned it. So I think he's in error, but I also think changing the definition to be more inclusive of people with higher functioning was also in error.  Like, the naming is arbitrary, and the errors are being committed due to an arbitrary change in terminology.",lakotajames,2025-04-24T11:16:31,1
"Just like how the Nazis insisted that Jews were weak and feeble. Why would they put Jews into labor camps? Doesn’t make sense for them to do labor if they’re physiologically inferior to Aryans, right?   Fascism is built on doublespeak and doesn’t hold up to scrutiny. Take a fascist at their word when they say they’ll harm you and be skeptical if they claim they’ll help you. Believing that a fascist always tells the truth is at your own peril.",Rastiln,2025-04-24T13:24:59,1
"It's the most plausible explanation I'm aware of.  Certainly more reasonable than, ""Fascists repeating old fascist plans almost point for point? Nonsense, that's obviously just coincidental wording and they clearly mean no harm!""",BitterFuture,2025-04-24T13:14:37,1
"The thing is that you can't just draw a line between what counts as high functioning and not. There are not literally two disorders. Its still the same thing, just different amounts. Also him believing that Asperger's still exists is literally him being uneducated. Of course I don't know if he actually believes that but you seem to think so.",Snerrion,2025-04-24T11:19:43,1
"It's not about believing them or holding their words up to scrutiny. It's about people taking the comments about he made about people on antidepressants and stimulants (because **he is an ex-drug addict**) and saying he said them about people with autism. It's a game of telephone across social media that people are getting wrong and it's easily debunked if you go back to the source:  >[""I’m going to create these wellness farms where they can go to get off of illegal drugs, off of opiates, but also illegal drugs, other psychiatric drugs, if they want to, to get off of SSRIs, to get off of benzos, to get off of Adderall, and to spend time as much time as they need — three or four years if they need it — to learn to get reparented, to reconnect with communities,"" he said during the broadcast. ](https://futurism.com/neoscope/rfk-jr-adderall-labor-camps)  I have an autistic brother and my boyfriend is autistic. There are many, many reasons to be alarmist about RFK and his views of the autistic community, so we don't need to make up new ones that undermine our credibility.",trace349,2025-04-24T14:46:17,1
"> It's the most plausible explanation I'm aware of.  Stop.  The most plausible explanation is that he's an absolute moron who thinks vaccines are bad, and uses his significant platform and notoriety to advance his kooky theories.  ""He's killing kids for funsies"" is not a plausible explanation.  ""He's a fascist because he sounds like what I think fascists sound like"" is not a plausible explanation.",ClockOfTheLongNow,2025-04-24T13:22:30,1
">There are not literally two disorders  There used to be, and then we decided there weren't. Unless someone can come up with a solid biological marker that identifies every case of autism, it's pure semantics.   >Also him believing that Asperger's still exists is literally him being uneducated.  He was educated, and the terminology changed around him. I'll agree to disagree though, it's all just semantics anyway.",lakotajames,2025-04-24T11:29:57,1
"I mean if you want to agree to disagree that's fine. But, it's still the internet, I'm fine to just keep arguing until I either understand your side or you understand my side. But if you gotta go or smthn then go ahead, I'm not gonna care if this ends w/o you agreeing with me.      Anyway back to the argument, I think everything got put under the umbrella term of ""autism"" *because* it was all semantics. There is not one thing that we can point at to say that one is Asperger's and that one is autism so we just said, its all autism now and its a spectrum, and blah blah blah. I don't see a problem with that.    Second point, Sure he *was* educated but now that education is considered misinformation. Especially for RFK Jr., it is his responsibility to keep up with the times. You can't just wave it off and say ""Good for you old man."" You admit he's wrong, don't try to defend him with a possible reason why he is wrong. He's still wrong.",Snerrion,2025-04-24T11:42:56,1
