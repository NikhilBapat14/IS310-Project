"As it turned out, the border could be properly protected without the bullshit the last administration was saying... WOW.",Wide_Fig3130,2025-04-16T21:54:09,59
This is a stroke of brilliance honestly.,Tasty_Explanation_20,2025-04-17T05:06:09,9
I feel sorry for Trump. He has to clean the mess created by BIden while also preventing future crossings. Basically he has to do twice the work in the same time.,STEM_forever,2025-04-16T23:31:02,10
Nice,WeUsedToBeFriends602,2025-04-16T22:07:16,7
Excellent. This lets the border patrol focus on the crossing points checking for illegal drugs.,Seamusnh603,2025-04-16T22:38:58,13

Very easily. But they want to import voters. It’s obvious,GenKraken,2025-04-16T21:55:37,12
"It'll be interesting to see how the next Dem administration tries to justify completely reopening the border. They can't claim ""it's just not possible"", because Trump has shown that it very clearly is.",Scamandrius,2025-04-17T00:32:46,18
The only people that didn't know that don't really have a brain to begin with.,kaytin911,2025-04-17T00:16:45,4
I think it's safe to assume more resources for crossing points and other areas that may have been lacking.,bozoconnors,2025-04-17T08:34:26,6
"There is a video out there of a reporter screaming a question at Biden “Mr President?!!  Mr President?!!  When will you get the Southern border under control again??”    Biden gets cocky and responds, rather strongly     “When Congress gives me the tools!!!!  I need the tools to get the  border fixed!!!”  Yeah, you had the tools you incoherent muppet.",cliffotn,2025-04-17T13:44:15,3
