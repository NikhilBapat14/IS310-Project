"**TLDR:**  * **Trump is hinting that he may be changing his position on reciprocal tariffs again.** * **He said he would impose tariffs on countries in two to three weeks if deals were not reached.** * **He previously said he would lower tariffs on countries that gave the US something ""phenomenal.""**",thisisinsider,2025-04-24T09:05:51,9

None of this is legal.  Once the Supreme Court gets the opportunity it will block all of this and no deals will have been made. The stock market will soar and Trump will be an embarrassed old laughing stock of the world.,sydneebmusic,2025-04-24T09:27:53,3

Trump changes his position on tariffs depending on how he's feeling when he wakes up. There's only one thing worse than high tariffs for small businesses: uncertainty. All Trump is doing is generating insane amounts of uncertainty for no gain at all. Absolute brain full of shit behavior.,HarwellDekatron,2025-04-24T09:49:00,1
