"He was part of some future deputy program with the sheriffs department. Probably participated in active shooter training and knew what to do when they arrived to not get shot.        My area does a multi-agency/multi-service(so police, fire, ems) active shooter training like once a year. They do a full mock up of an active shooter event, and take volunteers to play as victims. I think at some point they do a small training bit at the end of the day with the volunteers on what they can do if they ever find themselves in a real active shooter situation. Like they go over Run, Hide, Fight, and what you can do to help shooting victims until EMS arrives, etc.",HIM_Darling,2025-04-18T18:18:00,2
