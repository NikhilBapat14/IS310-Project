"The left likes to complain about Donald Trump ignoring the checks and balances and it doesn't make sense to me if a judge rules unconstitutionally does the president have to follow? There's no enforcement arm of the judiciary, so then it goes to scotus, if scotus upholds an unconstitutional ruling does the president have to follow it? Again there's no enforcement arm, at that point if the president is wrong and not following the courts the checks and balances would lead to possible impeachment right? So I get that it's controversial because during times of federal conflict the 3 branches have their authorities and powers for a reason and there is an answer for abuse.",fordr015,2025-04-16T21:33:08,4

"It's bad enough that he accepted the case in the first place. He's so vain and power hungry he won't let it go, even though SCOTUS ruled against him.",social_dinosaur,2025-04-16T17:08:37,8
