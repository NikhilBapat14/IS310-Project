"The entire point of extortion is to threaten to destroy valuable things.   Saying that Trump is endangering the world economy is making the extortionists threat for him.   I would be surprised if Trump doesn't put the IMF warning on billboards in every capital around the world.

"The thing is, even if you burn down the entire forest by throwing a lit cigarette into the bushes, the trees and fauna will still regrow from the ashes in time.   Our world's economy will go back to what it was sooner or later. With one exception, the US will not be invited to the next meeting in the forest again as it was them who threw the cigarette.   Your avarage voter may forget what shit Trump did, but believe me when I say this, the investors will remember it for a VERY long time.",Affectionate_Mix5081,2025-04-22T10:34:05,1
The world will stop using the US Dollar as a global currency standard altogether if the current administration doesn’t stop sowing economic chaos.  Then the orange cockwomble will have lost the trade war and will have permanently weakened the US dollar.,cheekmo_52,2025-04-22T10:38:24,1

A valid point!  It may work the other way too though - and scare countries to work together against him.  I think your scenario is more realistic though.,pharrt,2025-04-22T10:24:32,2
"If firefighters report that an arsonist has already set multiple fires, they're warning people about the damage. Reporting facts isn't the same as suggesting we should pay the arsonist a ransom to stop.",mentales,2025-04-22T10:30:11,1

"Not really scaring them...they already are forming new trade agreements.  The world economy is going to take a hit until those are ironed out, but they will all bounce back.  We will not.  We don't have the resources the Right seem to think we do.  We haven't for a long time.  We were top of the world after WW2 simply because we were one of the only countries left that still had the infrastructure to produce goods in the post war landscape.  We don't anymore.  They do.  They will be fine.  We'll be Soviet Russia.",ERedfieldh,2025-04-22T10:27:46,2

I am not saying that the IMF should be silent.   I am pointing out the irony that it is also doing Trump's work for him. ,Beantown-Jack,2025-04-22T10:42:07,1
