Unless I see her in an orange jumpsuit I don’t believe it.,obalovatyk,2025-04-24T04:27:59,61
"Letitia is a concern, especially when on application forms her dad becomes her husband, among other fraudulent things she has done!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-24T06:18:48,20
Even if she beats the rap this will bankrupt her.,WoodEyeLie2U,2025-04-24T07:49:04,11
"So a New York trial with a biased jury and judge that won’t convict her, just like the biased jury and judge convicted Trump on with no evidence.",Lifeisagreatteacher,2025-04-24T07:24:16,6
It's delusional to believe anything will happen to her. She's a Democrat in a democratic city surrounded by Democratic judges and jurists. How in the hell would she be charged with anything let alone convicted?  It seems like most conservatives have completely forgotten that there are 2 systems of justice in America.,r_barchetta,2025-04-24T07:57:05,4
"Ashamed of nothing but offended by everything, getting away with it by using her race and fueling TDS with hyperbole.  How often have we seen that?  How tired are we of hearing the same thing from others?",vampirepomeranian,2025-04-24T12:00:32,2

"I hate to do this, but she'll get the Democrat treatment. House arrest at worst  https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/24/marilyn-mosby-sentenced-house-arrest-baltimore/73834893007/",BrockLee76,2025-04-24T10:15:17,0
"She defrauded the federal government. She is cooked. And she just had multiple more complaints filed against her. She is facing decades in prison.   The stuff go back decades and with the law they used against Trump, she is facing document fraud even on the stuff that would normally be past the statute of limitation.  I guarantee you the Trump DOJ is coming down on her hard.",Batbuckleyourpants,2025-04-24T05:11:06,32
She'll pay a fine and maybe get sentenced to a few months of house arrest at most.,raccoonbandit13,2025-04-24T10:29:35,6

Federal charges that can be brought in Virginia or NY since the fraud occurred in both states.,wkramer28451,2025-04-24T07:43:00,11
Even if she only gets disbarred that will ruin her.,MadOblivion,2025-04-24T15:18:30,2
Even if she only gets disbarred that will ruin her.,MadOblivion,2025-04-24T15:17:28,1
These would be federal charges and the one about her Virginia home can be brought in the Eastern District of Virginia.,goinsouth85,2025-04-24T10:32:28,1
"One of two things will happen here:  1) she gets dumped as a political liability to the DNC while they are already struggling to recoup their losses from last year and become a favored party again, as it is  2) they circle the wagons and the media goes on a half-truth rampage in support of her and tries to shut down any dissent against her as “false disinformation”",ITrCool,2025-04-24T07:26:54,18

She should not be allowed to have a law license under any circumstances,Lifeisagreatteacher,2025-04-24T16:11:09,1
Not from making money. Plenty of ways to DEI grift,NoleSean,2025-04-24T15:21:50,1
Norfolk Virginia is where her Virginia house is located.  Like most of Virginia it is very conservative.  Only northern Virginia is extremely Liberal.,wkramer28451,2025-04-24T08:04:48,6
Those Money funneling NGO's are being dismantled as we speak.,MadOblivion,2025-04-24T15:49:52,1
So they try near her home not pick a location that favors Democrats. I still have Biden’s DOJ in my head.,Lifeisagreatteacher,2025-04-24T08:24:51,1
Since it will be a Federal prosecution you can be sure it will be in a Conservative stronghold.,wkramer28451,2025-04-24T08:26:07,0
