"At least 1,411 migrants attempted to cross the border in upstate New York alone in the first two weeks of April, according to data from the Canadian Border Services Agency.  That’s more than the entire month of March, when 1,356 people made the journey, which was already double the average of the previous months.  But unlike during the first Trump administration – when former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau welcomed migrants with open arms — this time around, Canada’s saying no thanks.  The surge follows Trump’s threats to go after some 530,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, who had been granted legal status during the Biden era.  The Department of Homeland Security said it was terminating the scheme – known as the CHNV parole program, arguing there were no urgent humanitarian reasons warranting their continued presence in the US, like Biden had claimed.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-20T10:17:03,28

The Democrats will do everything to undermine democracy. They are using everything in their power to ignore and stop congressionally passed immigration law.,kaytin911,2025-04-20T06:40:12,20

"You don't think that these are people the Democrats are counting on for their votes?  The strategy is pretty obvious:  Let in as many people as possible,  make it hard to require an ID to vote, easy for non-citizens to vote, and easy to harvest ballots.",Papa_Ganda,2025-04-20T13:41:01,6
