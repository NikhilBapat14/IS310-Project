DOGE is not a formal government department nor position. It has no executive power. It’s basically just a commission to study a problem and provide a recommendation.   It’s basically exactly the same as the 2010 Simpson Bowles   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Commission_on_Fiscal_Responsibility_and_Reform    Which was made up of Congress persons but also people in industry that were not subject to the emoluments clause.    Also not different than if say government hired Gartner to do research on a subject.,SovietRobot,2024-11-14T14:49:19,29
"It is a made up title.   https://www.brookings.edu/articles/cabinet-secretaries-versus-the-white-house-staff/  There is a cabinet and the White House staff. White House staff roles are largely just made up by the president and has no formal power so to speak.   Now a president can choose to take the guidance over their staff versus their Cabinet and in that sense, they have power, but they have no formalized power. They basically just conflict with the formal roles of the Cabinet.   I honestly think that this will pretty much just be a title to stroke Elon's ego moreso than something that actually accomplishes anything.",JayNotAtAll,2024-11-15T21:53:47,3
"This is why Vivek was named as his co-lead to get around the conflict of interest issue. We know it does nothing to protect the American people from the ravages that this foreign-born billionaire would be in a position to impose. But they think it's enough of a fig leaf that allows them to pretend to be following the letter of the law. It also allows Elon to continue to run his businesses while serving as an advisor a co-lead of the Federal government. Meanwhile, our government will continue to subsidize Elon's businesses and new ventures with tax payer dollars.  1.

So you are saying Simpson did it?,Serenikill,2024-11-14T16:35:02,4
"I would generally agree with this if not for the way Trump has said he wants to govern. Even if DOGE isn't an actual agency, those who are heads of agencies may feel compelled to abide by any recommendations. Saying DOGE is basically commissioning a study is like saying Heritage is just a think tank. A lack of executive power doesn't mean a lack of influence",randonumero,2024-11-14T17:08:31,9

"Eh you are stating something that is not acually finalized yet with way too much certainty and detail. You have no idea whether the Dept will only provide a recommendation. You do not know the level of power Trump can grant it, especially with control over all three branches of government.  The potential for corruption is immense. Anybody that doesn’t understand that simply lacks imagination. ",[deleted],2024-11-17T13:03:11,1
Musk has American citizenship and is not getting paid to run DOGE,[deleted],2024-11-23T11:59:37,1
"Oh I fully believe Trump will execute on the findings of DOGE.   But I’m saying that even as that may be, DOGE as simply an advisory commission itself, there’s no application of the emoluments clause. It’s been that way with every advisory commission since Clinton and before.    The emoluments clause applies to those with direct power and / or position. Not to those who advise those with power or position. A very clear and important distinction.    I’m arguing legality. Not influence.",SovietRobot,2024-11-14T18:11:33,7
That'd be just as true if Musk was giving recommendations on twitter instead. I think this is one of the many instances where our rules and norms just aren't equipped to deal with someone like Trump.,LivefromPhoenix,2024-11-14T17:41:47,2
No one said it does not have influence. But it has no executive authority and the budget will have to be approved by Congress.,[deleted],2024-11-23T11:59:06,1
"Yes, we know he has American citizenship? Was there a question about that?",NeatNefariousness1,2024-11-24T00:06:29,1
Exactly this. They are using the loophole of not being an actual federal agency to avoid being a conflict of interest.,Egad86,2024-11-14T19:48:04,7
">The emoluments clause applies to those with direct power and / or position. Not to those who advise those with power or position. A very clear and important distinction.   That would be depending on the interpretation of the situation itself, so no... It's not clear or distinct at all...  If I take someone out to dinner and convince them to help my business and you call that a bribe- all I have to say is that it was a ""gift"" with no strings attached...",[deleted],2024-11-16T05:12:25,1
Would you consider Bowles Simpson 2010 commission as using the same loophole? It had members that had businesses.    Would you also consider Bidens SCOTUS commission as using the same loophole? It also had members that had businesses.   https://www.whitehouse.gov/pcscotus/,SovietRobot,2024-11-14T20:10:02,-1
"I worked for government - and actually it was for procurement and then later I did a stint with State - so I know exactly what bribery and gifts entails and - no you cannot take a gov official out and offer anything material of value in order to convince them to help your business by calling it a gift.    There are actually two layers of restrictions. There’s federal law like Section 201 and then there’s internal department regulations.    Even if it’s not against federal law, you can still be fired if they find out that you’d gone against internal government regulations which are a level stricter.    Every single year we had to review and sign like a stack of 30 pages to confirm that we understood and could attest to the above.    In fact, when we worked for State, we would make an act of graciously exchanging or accepting gifts from our foreign counterparts, then right after we had to turn them back in to the department as we couldn’t keep them.   The law and separately regulations are quite clear in that regard.    As are the laws and regulations that it’s legal for government to hire a commission to do a study, even if that commission includes people who own businesses.    There must have been hundreds of procurements of commissions to do studies, that involved private businesses or people that had private businesses, that went through my department in the decade plus that I was there. We are talking studies by medical companies, engineering companies, construction companies, environmental companies, and even studies by advocacy groups that clearly had a political agenda by definition.   Edit - I mean look at Biden’s Office of Gun Violence Prevention that was commission to do gun violence studies. Two of its heads run anti gun political advocacy groups.",SovietRobot,2024-11-16T06:54:02,1

"What in the world are you talking about that has anything to do with my argument?   My point is super simple:   1. Government often hires commissions to do studies 2. Commissions to do studies provide information to government to inform government action 3. It is not illegal for commissions hired by government to include people who run, work or own businesses related to the subject of that commisssion   That’s it.     Examples of commissions - Commission on Fine Arts, Commission on Foreign Investment, Indian Arts and Crafts Commission, Marine Mammal Commission,  Children’s Health Protection Advisory, US Commission on Civil Rights, Human Space Flight Commission, and I could go on and on.    All the above, including DOGE include people that work or own business  and that’s legal. That’s my only point.   If you want to argue that in general, people can be corrupt and flaunt the law - then, sure, you go with that.",SovietRobot,2024-11-16T07:26:44,0
