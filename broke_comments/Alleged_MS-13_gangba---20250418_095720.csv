Why do we even give a fuck about this wife beater. Should we not pay attention to actual Americans in need,baseball_Lover33,2025-04-18T11:09:43,106
This is extremely misleading and poorly written esp for the post. It makes it seem like he had a legal right to be in the us prior to deportation. No he didn’t the deportation had already been ordered twice (deferred once) and should be carried out after Ms 13 was rightly declared a terrorist organization. The only mistake was deporting him to the single country in the entire world he should not have been deported to. But it’s also his home country where he holds citizenship so too bad his own govt can decide what to do with him. Also the SC in no way ordered trump to bring him back. What bullshit.,Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-04-18T10:17:23,70

"Teleconference him in for his day in court. Approve the whatever is needed for deportation. Move on from the topic. He's clearly a scum bag, so just zoom him in to his day in court",JurassicParkFood,2025-04-18T19:16:11,0

There's a well known dem hero that pointed a handgun at a baby in the womb.   Nothing shocks me anymore,Legio-V-Alaudae,2025-04-18T12:13:41,74
"Because we have to contend with ""fellow conservatives"" crying about due process. He had due process in 2019, where an immigration court established his gang affiliation. The “withholding of removal” status was due to a (at the time) credible fear of gang violence. However, the gang appears to have been dissolved, so that threat is gone.",Panzershrekt,2025-04-18T15:28:32,12

"Because democrats can score political points off of it.  Even though it is all a lie and fabrication, half of what democrats believe is true is already a fabrication so this is just consistent with what they already believe .",OzoneLaters,2025-04-18T14:00:34,5
The media is corrupt and is twisting the words of court decisions. I genuinely don't understand how they are getting away with it.,theboss2461,2025-04-18T11:02:02,18
">Also the SC in no way ordered trump to bring him back.  I keep seeing this thing about the SC saying bring him back, where does this come from?",UziInYourFace,2025-04-18T12:57:12,7
He just wanted to pass a bad $20.  :),OzoneLaters,2025-04-18T14:01:17,15
"I hope this gets more people on board with just gritting their teeth and accepting that there is no optical way to do deportation. It can be small targeted deportation, it can be mass deportation, the media will brazenly lie either way.  They're reacting the same way to Garcia being deported as they would if he was a 5 year old girl whose family crossed the border when she was 1.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-18T12:18:50,9
"People don't understand what ""facilitate"" means. Just a lack of information and reading into things, as all their talking points are.",highlightway,2025-04-18T13:04:32,0
"People read “must facilitate his return” to mean “must initiate his return by demanding El Salvador give him back”. Any rationale person knows those are not the same statements, but when are liberals ever rational about anything? If El Salvador insists they return Garcia to the us we will have to take him back and trump can’t block or ignore it he must facilitate the transfer back…but El Salvador is not returning him in fact they are keen on keeping their own citizen so case closed.",Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-04-18T13:21:02,2
That and a safe cop car to safely eat a bunch of fentanyl before he went home to be a 'good dad'.,Q_me_in,2025-04-18T19:19:20,6
It was all because of something that one of their attorneys wrote on a filing.  They planned on giving him one more hearing before deportation but just deported him before that.  He would have been deported anyway so the hearing was basically just for show so it doesn’t matter anyway.,OzoneLaters,2025-04-18T14:03:17,2
It disgusts me to watch the movie “The Fall of Minneapolis” and see the truth and how all the democrats just lied in unison including all the voters!,OzoneLaters,2025-04-19T09:47:12,2
