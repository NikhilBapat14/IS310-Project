The Democratic Party needs to embrace some new blood. Trying to cater to the centrists and Republican-lites has been an absolute failure.,theRAV,2025-04-24T19:46:23,1

"The DNC is having trouble between the corporate wing and the progressive worker wing.  The progressive wing brings the activism, street canvassing, visibility, and helps voters to the booth.  Unfortunately, the large donors on the corporate side bring in 80% of the funds.  Hogg wants younger, enthusiastic candidates but the old fogies have the wallet connections.",MentalTourniquet,2025-04-24T19:48:45,1

"This right here is the perfect example of why the U.S. is headed for an Oligarchy.    The Democratic Party needs to differentiate themselves from the Republicans. Catering to the rich establishment isn't cutting it, and has directly resulted in 2 Trump terms. ",theRAV,2025-04-24T19:54:00,1
"Many picked Trump because he's a hate monger. He's a racist, a sexist, and hates LGBT. And he's given the far right cover to hate freely like they have always had.  He won some of the middle because they liked what he had to say. But they made the mistake of trusting a man that couldnt explain how he would do any of the things he said. He sold a dream of bringing back 1960 and all these fantastic high-paying manufacturing jobs where a household can survive again on a single income and still buy a house, a car, a puppy, and a large family with the wife staying at home. That's the America dream they think they want to return to. But it's an America that isn't possible anymore.     Not those voters are going to learn a very difficult and hard lesson.",InsideAside885,2025-04-24T20:48:01,1
Trump got fewer votes in 2024 than he did in 2020. The difference was that the Democrats weren't able to get people to turn out in 2024.,theRAV,2025-04-24T20:33:13,1
"That’s not very nuanced. It could be argued that they swung anti establishment  and established norms were set out with bipartisan consensus. If bipartisanship, which relies on compromise was so appealing why did the no compromises candidate win?",Mental_Priority_7083,2025-04-24T20:30:03,1
It's already here.  The Citizens United decision killed any hope of a party purely for the benefit of the middle and lower classes.,MentalTourniquet,2025-04-24T20:03:34,1
How would an appeal to base populism differentiate the Democrats from Republicans?,430_Autogyro,2025-04-24T20:40:04,1
"But *will* they learn that lesson? Or will they blame Democrats and move on. So far, there are a number of polls that show Trump losing support on certain issues, yes, but a lot of polls seem to suggest that no one is regretting their vote....or *not* showing up. That doesn't scream confidence.",430_Autogyro,2025-04-24T20:55:09,1
"That's the story of virtually every American election for the last several decades; when Democrats show up, they win. There's nothing unique about 2024, save the fact that voters perceptions were historically disconnected from economic, diplomatic and security realities.",430_Autogyro,2025-04-24T20:37:39,1
">Trump got fewer votes in 2024 than he did in 2020. The difference was that the Democrats weren't able to get people to turn out in 2024.  Check your math.   Trump got 74,223,975 votes in 2020.  He got 77,302,580 in 2024.   Admittedly, he probably would have still lost if Biden's 2020 voters had all shown up, but ultimately he gained over 3 million voters from 2020 to 2024.",TheBigLeMattSki,2025-04-24T20:54:58,1
"It's a hard reach to argue that Trump is ""anti-establishment."" He's a former president. They picked him because they liked what he did before. That's not anti-establishment, that's an express preference for brutalizing immigrants, limiting the rights of women, and punishing civil servants.",430_Autogyro,2025-04-24T20:39:03,1

"How soon we all forget that the majority of Obama's campaign funds came from small donors. We don't have to keep catering to the rich establishment Democrats, that's just a choice the party keeps making. ",theRAV,2025-04-24T20:07:52,1
For example... https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/bernie-sanders-aoc-folsom-rally-20279970.php,theRAV,2025-04-24T20:48:11,1
"> There's nothing unique about 2024, save the fact that  2024 was very unique - a Republican that campaigned for ~4 years was running against a Democrat that only had 3 months to campaign.  And the billionaire owned media wanted their tax cuts, and so barely reported that the Democrat was running on a $15/minimum wage.",m0nk_3y_gw,2025-04-24T21:00:46,1
"Yeah, I'm sure that not allowing a primary, and then switching to a candidate who said that she wouldn't do anything different than her unpopular predecessor had nothing to do with the low turnout. ",theRAV,2025-04-24T20:41:40,1

"Majority is a bit misleading. According to OpenSecrets, 44.98% came from small donors, 43.12 came from large donors. It's an impressive amount, but it was also historically unique and more a plurality than a majority.",430_Autogyro,2025-04-24T20:30:24,1
You're trying to differentiate this populist appeal from Trump...by bragging about crowd size?,430_Autogyro,2025-04-24T20:53:33,1
"Unfortunately, there's nothing unique about any of that anymore, either.       For the preceding four years, every story was borderline farce: ""Biden passes historic legislation, here's why that's a problem for Biden...""",430_Autogyro,2025-04-24T21:06:55,1
"Actually, probably not. Because the operative ""disconnect"" is on ""unpopular predecessor."" There was literally nothing Biden could do that would have gotten progressives to turn out. Biden's public approval dipped after he withdrew from Afghanistan and never, ever recovered regardless of passing historic legislation in both its scale and pattern-breaking frequency, regardless of navigating a once-in-a-century pandemic, and rallying NATO to Ukraine's defense.   Policy does not matter to the American people. Only ""vibes"" and the vibe right now...is Trump. That's what the American people want. Hate and chaos is what they want.",430_Autogyro,2025-04-24T20:50:03,1
"> Yeah, I'm sure that not allowing a primary,  there was a primary.  Biden won it.  Each state has it's own primary rules - there is literally NO WAY to do a 50 state primary 3 months before the general election.    The way it works is that you have a contested convention.  Abe Lincoln was no one's first choice, he didn't secure the nomination until the THIRD round of voting.  The Dems didn't have a contested convention because, with only 3 months until the general, the competition decided it was likely to crash and burn so they endorsed Harris instead of trying to run themselves.",m0nk_3y_gw,2025-04-24T21:03:51,1
"The distinguishing line for those stats is $200. I'm not rich, but I gave more than $200 to Obama.    I'm curious, but why are you in favor of the status quo for the Democratic Party?",theRAV,2025-04-24T20:45:07,1
