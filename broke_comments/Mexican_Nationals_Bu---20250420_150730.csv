"Interesting they're here on ""non immigrant"" visas.  So I wonder which faux visa route they chose - tourism, business, study, or temporary work?   Expedited removal right here I hope.",theycalllmeTIM,2025-04-20T16:24:18,111
"""Last month, in Fremont County, Colorado, a mostly rural county southwest of Colorado Springs, two Fremont County detectives noted a van passing them without dimming headlights and so turned and initiated a traffic stop - and what they found was an eye-opener: Around 180,000 rounds of .30 caliber and 7.62mm rifle ammunition, [packed in cases in the van](https://www.foxnews.com/us/mexican-nationals-arrested-while-transporting-180000-rounds-ammunition-from-utah-colorado).""

"Curious case for me. From a purely legal standpoint, other than the minor traffic infractions, did they actually do anything illegal?  I completely agree that it smells more than fishy and likely they were up to no good, but devil's advocate says if traveling with a lot of ammo isn't illegal then it shouldn't be an issue. If they thought these guys were planning on smuggling it across the border, why not just track them until they do try to cross the border and bust them there (where it probably is illegal to cross with weapons / ammo)?  I'm just hyper conscious that the government loves to use a valid earlier case as the precedent to do the same action against people later that isn't valid.",NyJosh,2025-04-20T15:37:32,34
"Well you see where you fucked up?  Personally, I got tired of carrying 180,000 rounds of ammo everywhere I go. Sure, it might come in handy one day, but that day never seems to come.  My solution was to keep 179,998 at home and only take twelve with me.😁",Cool_Cat_Punk,2025-04-20T16:13:18,29
"Ok, that’s an “arsenal” that makes me concerned something criminal is happening or about to happen. That’s at least $180k assuming they’re buying those rounds at $1/round.  That’s not normal.",esqadinfinitum,2025-04-21T00:14:04,4
Im sure liberals are now pro self defense and to take it away is definitely racist,Xander_hades_,2025-04-21T01:59:37,4
Maybe they were just running it from Utah to sell on the black market without Colorado's 14 new gun related taxes.,NotAnotherRedditAcc2,2025-04-23T16:41:16,1
"I have a significant fraction of that at home, but that is a shit ton to be transporting all at once.  Very curious as to where they were taking that.....",Slagggg,2025-04-21T12:52:36,1

"A lot of these are just excuses to cover up whatever kind of information they're getting on cartel activities.  There have been a lot of dashcam videos recently where the stop goes something like ""hey so I saw you changed lanes after signaling for only 4 seconds instead of 5, I'll need to have you step out of the car while I run a dog through.""",ChristopherRoberto,2025-04-21T00:44:48,11
