No we need to get past the Democrat lawfare. This idea is extremely stupid. Or keep running on it until enough are in congress to authorize a change in the law to never allow this to happen again without being able to quickly deport.,kaytin911,2025-04-22T20:34:37,30
I mean if we don’t accommodate them they will have to leave ,CalmHabit3,2025-04-22T21:32:46,12
The liberal judges aren't helping. Most of them know that a lot of what they do will be reversed. That's the problem I have with it. They're not really being truthful. They just have TDS and want to slow down the process. They probably know deep in their hearts that what he's doing should be done. But they're liberals lol.,BossJackson222,2025-04-22T22:23:16,5
"He could also make the US Census more frequent. We really need to clear out the cobwebs in government and stop acting like we're in the stone-age. We have the technology to count annually. Every ten years is geriatric, especially with an 11M influx of illegal immigrants recently, you could argue an emergency count.",Right_Archivist,2025-04-22T21:20:32,8
lolol how about we deport them and send the bill to their home country.,murderinthedark,2025-04-22T23:23:50,2
They are doing everything at once. Trying different methods is what will get the numbers up. The biggest issue is asylum and getting those hearings on speed dial. Biden let in millions of people who all claimed asylum. There needs to be penalties for claiming a false asylum. They need to be deported and told they can never return. Why don’t they do a triage and interview everyone again? People that have the most evidence of claiming asylum would be fast tracked through to get asylum. This waiting 4 years for a court date is absolutely ridiculous.,Dazzling_Pink9751,2025-04-23T00:26:18,2
"I'm fine offering them money to self deport, as long as it comes with a caveat making attempted re-entry after that point a felony breach of contract.",JustinCayce,2025-04-22T21:13:38,-7
"Yeah they are trying to get the judicial branch to take away the ability of the executive branch to dictate foreign policy, Trump doesn’t even have to listen to them.  They are completely beyond their jurisdiction.  In my opinion they are criminally beyond, I think they have committed some kind of crime here in trying to abuse their power to limit the executive.",OzoneLaters,2025-04-22T21:38:52,16
"Liberals and liberals in Congress are now saying they want all illegal aliens to be in front of a judge before they can be deported. Think about that. I've heard it would take 200 years to just deport the 500,000 illegal alien criminals, much less anyone else. Liberals know this. They adore illegal immigration. They don't want them gone. The collateral damage done to Americans is totally worth it to oppose Donald Trump.",BossJackson222,2025-04-22T22:25:33,8
"This 100%. I think that's a great idea for Trump to push. Just do not give them anything. Not a freaking thing. No healthcare, no benefits no nothing. Take away what you can. They will leave.",BossJackson222,2025-04-22T22:23:50,6
"They know the loop holes of due process. It takes years to get these people court dates. Something has to give. Trump is trying to every angle around that. It’s like someone who qualifies for a program, you know most people don’t qualify, but they have to legally look at their application and interview them. You know and they know they don’t qualify, but it’s a little game that is played. The problem with not having a cut off point is that there are millions of people playing the I don’t really qualify, but I am going to apply anyway. Congress doesn’t have the numbers right now to change asylum laws. The best option is to put people in another safe country to wait for the court trial. They are just being held there temporarily. That is what the remain in Mexico was all about, but Biden messed that up.",Dazzling_Pink9751,2025-04-23T00:38:47,0
"That may require a constitutional amendment as the frequency of the census is directly set by Article I. If he were to conduct an unofficial census that doesn't change House districts however, that may be permissible. ",Iuris_Aequalitatis,2025-04-22T21:48:38,6
"Offering aliens money to self-deport will only encourage people to keep entering our country illegally:  Illegal alien - ""Guys, if we slip into the US unnoticed, all we have to do is make it to a Democrat sanctuary city and we're set!  And if we get caught, they'll give us money to leave.  It's a win-win situation!""  We don't need any carrots in this situation.  Just sticks.",MildlyBemused,2025-04-23T00:20:53,2
I agree. They have been seizing more and more power. It's very bad for the separation of powers that keeps us from authoritarianism. Every country ruled by courts are extremely corrupt oligarchies.,kaytin911,2025-04-22T22:01:05,5
There never needed to be hearings like that. The left are deep in the courts that have now seized control of the border. It is a crisis. They also have lawyer special interest groups that benefit from this money siphoning from our taxpayer dollars.,kaytin911,2025-04-22T22:37:13,6
"But how will they survive without their free food, shelter, cell phones, and prepaid debit cards!?!?!?",MeLlamoKilo,2025-04-23T00:48:41,2
How about they conduct one because the last one had absolutely irrefutable mistakes that had serious effects on how the government is run?  They should also mark citizens apart from none citizens and none citizens shouldn’t count towards seats and districts. ,Blahblahnownow,2025-04-22T23:31:38,1
