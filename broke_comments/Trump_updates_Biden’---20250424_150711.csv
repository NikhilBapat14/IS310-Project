"Under the previous SGO, if a vehicle with a Level 2 driver assist system or above had a crash that didn’t involve a fatality or a vulnerable road user (think pedestrian or cyclist), it had to be reported within 5 days if the vehicle had to be towed away or had an airbag deployment, said Sam Abuelsamid, VP for market research at Telemetry and an expert in autonomous vehicle technology.  Now, under the revised rule, a crash only has to be reported if the vehicle has a Level 4 automated driving system, like Waymo. Vehicle crashes involving Level 2 systems that don’t involve a fatality or vulnerable road user are now exempted from reporting. And who benefits the most from this change?  “This has a huge impact on one particular company, Tesla, because Autopilot and \[Full Self-Driving\] are only L2 systems, not automated driving systems,” Abuelsamid explains. “Tesla has long complained about the fact that the vast majority of SGO reports are from their vehicles and this will eliminate all of the reports that don’t include a fatality or hitting a vulnerable road user.”  Read more from Andrew Hawkins: [https://www.theverge.com/news/655834/trump-tesla-crash-reporting-rule-adas-nhtsa-sgo](https://www.theverge.com/news/655834/trump-tesla-crash-reporting-rule-adas-nhtsa-sgo)",theverge,2025-04-24T15:12:04,1

I'm simply amazed at how adept the MAGAts are at finding ways to protect themselves from responsibility for the harm they cause (or will allow to be caused).,phosdick,2025-04-24T15:19:50,1

"Musk is a lot like Trump. He continues to oversell the abilities of his companiesz Instead of fixing issues, he spends most of his time addressing regulations that might call him out on his BS. He’s a day-trader.",LastHurrahs,2025-04-24T17:01:48,1
