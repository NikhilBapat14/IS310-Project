"Sadly the old dems were the only ones really holding crazy back. Once the younger ones get in, they'll be squad levels of crazy and insane or far worse.  demoncrats cannot get back into power or this country will be doomed.",Nero_Ocean,2025-04-24T12:54:24,27

"These ""younger Dems"" are most likely all gonna be incompetent and cause Republicans to gain support.",theboss2461,2025-04-24T10:52:48,15

"The DNC already sabotaged both of Bernie Sanders' presidential campaigns because they knew that the remaining moderates, and more importantly independents, would never vote for 'democratic socialism'.   The Progs might win some House and Senate seats where Dems are strong but tossups maybe not. And I just can't see the DNC allowing one to win the nomination for 2028. That would be courting self destruction.",social_dinosaur,2025-04-24T11:56:30,4

"Yup, the younger ""Dem's"" are more lefists than the leftists of old.",GiediOne,2025-04-24T11:46:32,14
"The timing is pretty good for Democrats though. Three of the four so far are in WI, NH, and MI, which could be potential pickups for the GOP in a good election year. However, we all know that midterms are not typically favorable for the majority party. So Dems have a good shot at not only keeping those three seats, but replacing them with younger incumbents who may be there for decades.  We’ll see how the country is doing in 2026 though. If the tariff war is behind us and the economy is humming again, the GOP’s chances in 2026 would be improved significantly. November 2026 is light years away in terms of politics.",r777m,2025-04-24T12:56:42,10

"I live in California, most of the boomers out here are extremely left wing. They will fall in line. It’s the gen X’ers that are much more moderate and will be turned off by the far left democrats.",jacksonexl,2025-04-24T13:36:23,8
