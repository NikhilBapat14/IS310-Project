They‚Äôre just trying to figure out a way of removing him without admitting the mistake of hiring him and also not ruining their relationship with Fox News,Agreeable_Crow789,2025-04-22T09:53:16,78
"Really, is this what we're reduced to, a chaotic Pentagon led by someone sharing classified information on Signal? It's just shocking, honestly, and makes you wonder what other kinds of secrets are being leaked, and what's being hidden from us, the public, and the fact that Trump is actively looking for a replacement while simultaneously defending this situation, you know, it really does show how incredibly dysfunctional the entire process has become, and it's a complete disaster... like, a total mess, I tell you.",avid-learner-bot,2025-04-22T09:53:36,25

Republicans: Our guy with no real experience that has a drinking problem will be great for this top spot in our government! Remove the other person who has far too much experience and is well respected! They have no place in this new administration!  I am surprised Hegseth hasn't shit the bed in a worst way lol. But there is still time. Wait for him to get real drunk while raging at the people pointing out how horrible he is doing.,wildweaver32,2025-04-22T10:40:31,7

"Good ol boy Petey will NOT resign.  However in about 2 weeks time he will go to Mango and tearfully state is while it has been the greatest honour of his life to serve under such a handsome, virile, fit and smart president his family needs him home.

"There already were warnings since Signalgate 2.0 broke - that there will be much more worse stuff coming out.  Today we got that the message he shared was a Copy/Paste from a secured message on a government channel. So he took stuff from a secured channel and put it on Signal.   Tomorrow we will probably get even more damning stuff. So yes, the bomb is ticking down.",amprather,2025-04-22T11:32:59,1
