"As I said, this is not a mistake. This is Trump weaponizing the government in support of his fascist goals.   It took Hitler a year to consolidate all of his power after he became Chancellor in January 1933.    Thanks to computers and the DOGEd determination of his faithful sidekick Musk, as well as Vance, Pam Bondi, and Marco Rubio (who had 100% support from the Democrats) and the Republicans in Congress, Trump is moving even faster.    I keep getting downvoted by people on Reddit who think I'm hyperbolic or exaggerating when I say that we've had a fascist takeover every bit as real as the one Germany had in 1933.     ""Let's just have some protests with some placards and signs and catchy chants!""   How well would that have worked against Hitler's Nazis?    The only reason we're even allowed to have those protests is because they haven't consolidated all their power yet. They've already floated the idea of making these protests illegal. Of course it's a violation of the First Amendment but look at all the amendments they've already violated. It means nothing to them.   By the time redditors wake up and realize what has happened will be too late to organize the aggressive response which is required.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-23T17:44:34,474

"I frequently lurk, but rarely post.  These poor people. His wife. Their. CHILDREN. What are we doing?! What has our country become?!  I am sick to my stomach. I’m what many would call a ‘grown-ass man,’ and I just fell into uncontrollable, ugly sobs over the truly abhorrent treatment of this family that I have never met, living among us. His wife is a US CITIZEN! That shouldn’t matter, but in case that is your litmus test for caring about things, bear that in mind.  How did we fall this far?! We cannot delay our outrage any longer. Our country has fallen to the levels of depravity reserved for the boogeymen that we grew up reading about in our history books. Even my father, a heavily right-leaning man who (unfortunately) listened to Rush Limbaugh on the radio throughout my entire childhood, is disgusted by our current administration and described Trump as “wiping his ass with the constitution.”   Enough. ENOUGH! There were many times in the quite recent past that the line should have been considered crossed, but for me, I’ve finally hit my breaking post today. Any of us who have even a SINGLE OUNCE of humanity left should be absolutely disgusted by this - and if not, you are truly, completely lost (and I can say earnestly that if you aren’t yet, I hope you come back to us soon). We can no longer wait and pretend that things will go back to normal soon. Our government needs to hear the voice of their people. Now.

"This is an intentional, aggressive act, that flies in the face of federal law protecting victims rights. Every state has laws protecting victims, and so do the feds in the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA). Doesn't change the nature of public records or their availability, but means documents must get reviewed and all personally identifiable victim info must be redacted.  *(Copying & pasting more than I normally would, because who knows when this might be deleted by 'DOGE')*  [September 2024 DOJ Journal of Federal Law & Practice:](https://www.justice.gov/usao/media/1371451/dl?inline)  >The act astutely captures the spirit of the practice of privacy law and policy in its ""right eight,"" which is ""the right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy.""   >In many contexts, including ""privacy torts,"" the protection of individuals' privacy is linked to the protection of their dignity. As such, the practice of privacy law and policy often requires the practitioner to consider unique facts and circumstances not articulated in statute.  . . .   >In all circumstances, Department personnel are responsible for protecting the information collected to fulfill each component's mission.  . . .  >The Privacy Act, by its definition of ""individuals,"" controls federal agencies' disclosures of records pertaining to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. **Noncitizen victims and witnesses, through other legal authorities, may also be entitled to certain privacy-related protections and safeguards**. Such protections, for example, may apply depending on the form of legal relief being sought, the legal action being pursued, or the individual's mental state.  >The Department, whether through civil or criminal matters or the administration of immigration proceedings, encounters hundreds of thousands of individuals each year who are seeking protection from persecution and torture. **Information contained in or about any application for asylum or credible fear or reasonable fear determination, along with any other records related to these applications, shall not be disclosed without the written consent of the applicant, absent an enumerated exception or the exercise of the AG's discretion.**  >The AG's discretion in this context has been used sparingly, and the enumerated exceptions are limited. Exceptions that allow for third-party disclosure of information related to these fear-based requests include the following: a qualified need to examine records in connection with the adjudication of the application or consideration of the request; the defense of any legal action arising from the adjudication of the application or request; the defense of any legal action which the application or request is a part of; any U.S. government civil or criminal investigation; and any federal, state, or local court in the United States considering legal action arising from the adjudication of the application or a proceeding in which the application or request is a part of.  >Overall, these exceptions allow limited release in the context of civil or criminal law enforcement investigations and litigation. Such actions may arise directly from the adjudication of asylum applications or credible or reasonable fear requests (for example, direct appeal, mandamus action to compel the underlying administrative body to act on the application or request), or legal actions where the information is a part of (for example, class action litigation or collateral matters such as habeas relief, Bivens actions, or matters arising under the Federal Torts Claims Act). **Additional safeguards may be necessary to protect the subject's privacy and safety where such information is received, given the sensitive nature of this information and potential harm to the individual should the information become public. Merely disclosing the identity of the individual and the fact the individual is seeking protection from removal to a country where they claim they were or will be persecuted or tortured could create a new claim for relief should the foreign government or entity learn of the claim.** Additional safeguards may include proceeding under a pseudonym or seeking a protective order that would limit the public disclosure of this information. Do not assume that because the subject has affirmatively disclosed this information in the proceedings the government should not proceed with caution and seek additional safeguards and protections when responding",prosecutor_mom,2025-04-24T00:25:25,7

Unlike incitement to terrorism, stochastic terrorism is accomplished with indirect, vague or coded language, which grants the instigator plausible deniability for any associated violence.[1] A key element of stochastic terrorism is the use of media for propagation, where the person carrying out the violence may not have direct connection to any other users of violent rhetoric.  Anyone that didn't vote against Trump, that includes people that refused to vote...you did this. Not that either of those two groups has any remorse, unless it fucks with their money.

"What utterly boggles my mind and absolutely pisses me off is that both parties have let the executive branch build up more and more and more power for decades and decades now. The Republicans always add more power to the executive branch, even when the president isn't a Republican, because they know that the Democratic presidents will never abuse it. And the Democrats always let them do it, wringing their hands for 5 minutes, writing the first paragraph of a sternly worded letter, and then going on to talk about other things.   When the Democrats are in power, they never do anything to make sure that the executive branch doesn't have too much power. I have never heard of anyone doing anything to reduce the power of the executive branch even once in my entire lifetime.",LoveCareThinkDo,2025-04-23T18:24:27,-14

And then they will demand more, because this is a beast that needs feeding constantly.  In short, it's your bog standard reactionary movement. They imagine a social and moral hierarchy based on identity (i.e. they are good people and deserve privileges because who they are), tie their self worth and perception of status to that hierarchy, and then reward violence that reinforces it.

"And you are an alarmist. You are saying that this must lead to this, and you can’t prove it. These are the beginnings, yes; but how do you know for sure when you don’t know the end, and how do you know, or even surmise, the end? On the one hand, your enemies, the law, the regime, the Party, intimidate you. On the other, your colleagues pooh-pooh you as pessimistic or even neurotic. You are left with your close friends, who are, naturally, people who have always thought as you have.  But your friends are fewer now. Some have drifted off somewhere or submerged themselves in their work. You no longer see as many as you did at meetings or gatherings. Informal groups become smaller; attendance drops off in little organizations, and the organizations themselves wither. Now, in small gatherings of your oldest friends, you feel that you are talking to yourselves, that you are isolated from the reality of things. This weakens your confidence still further and serves as a further deterrent to—to what? It is clearer all the time that, if you are going to do anything, you must make an occasion to do it, and then you are obviously a troublemaker. So you wait, and you wait.  But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes. That’s the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions would have been sufficiently shocked—if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in ’43 had come immediately after the ‘German Firm’ stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in ’33. But of course this isn’t the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.  ""And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying ‘Jewish swine,’ collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in—your nation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.  You have gone almost all the way yourself. Life is a continuing process, a flow, not a succession of acts and events at all. It has flowed to a new level, carrying you with it, without any effort on your part. On this new level you live, you have been living more comfortably every day, with new morals, new principles. You have accepted things you would not have accepted five years ago, a year ago, things that your father, even in Germany, could not have imagined.  Suddenly it all comes down, all at once. You see what you are, what you have done, or, more accurately, what you haven’t done (for that was all that was required of most of us: that we do nothing). You remember those early meetings of your department in the university when, if one had stood, others would have stood, perhaps, but no one stood. A small matter, a matter of hiring this man or that, and you hired this one rather than that. You remember everything now, and your heart breaks. Too late.

"But the real story is that Americans AREN’T just sitting on their asses.   There have been regular protests with millions of Americans attending on a regular basis. And the numbers are increasing as the days go by. U.S. citizens are contacting their representatives on a daily basis, or going to town halls to express their disgust and anger at what is happening.   What many people fail to understand is the sheer size of the United States, the area of which is only about 310,000 square kilometers less than Europe- roughly the size of Italy. Europe has 44 countries, the U.S is one. Europe has nearly twice as many people as the U.S.   Taking these ideas together, it is hard to generate the concentration of protestors one sees in the U.S., where the drive from Washington State to Washington D.C. is 47 hours as compared to, let’s say France, where it is a six hour drive from one border to the other.   In addition, it’s hard to generate enthusiasm for things like general strikes when the U.S. government has been consistently eroding worker protections and the ability unionize. U.S workers have very few rights and risk losing their health care or their job if they strike. We are a nation of wage slaves.   It’s also hard to develop unity with our fellow citizens when we have been sold, and many have bought into, the lie that other Americans are the enemy- not the politicians, or the corporations.  There are millions of dissenters in the U.S. We are just spread out over thousands of cities and millions of miles and have yet to recognize we power hold collectively.",meganac69,2025-04-23T20:10:51,5

"The term is Stochastic Terrorism   "" Stochastic terrorism is a form of political violence instigated by hostile public rhetoric directed at a group or an individual. Unlike incitement to terrorism, stochastic terrorism is accomplished with indirect, vague or coded language, which grants the instigator plausible deniability for any associated violence.[1] A key element of stochastic terrorism is the use of media for propagation, where the person carrying out the violence may not have direct connection to any other users of violent rhetoric.[2][3][4]  """,ThePrideOfKrakow,2025-04-23T20:26:55,2

At its core was a government campaign called *Gleichschaltung*--meaning ""Coordination""--to bring citizens, government ministries, universities, and cultural and social institutions in line with National Socialist beliefs and values.   >""Coordination"" occurred with astonishing speed, even in sectors of life not directly targeted by specific laws, as Germans willingly placed themselves under the sway of Nazi rule, a phenomenon that became known as *Selbstgleichschaltung,* or, ""self-coordination."" Change came to Germany so quickly and across such a wide front that German citizens who left the country for business or travel returned to find everything around them altered, as if they were characters in a horror movie who come back to find that people who once were their friends, clients, patients, and customers have become different in ways hard to discern.",Tanjelynnb,2025-04-23T19:34:19,6

"Agree. Most of us who are active in these protests and demonstrations were born in the ‘70’s, ‘80’s & ‘90’s, many were also born after 9/11…we weren’t around when our parents and older generations were protesting Vietnam or civil rights or campus unrest of the ‘60’s. It’s in our blood, but we haven’t been directly faced with anything as truly life-threatening as what we’re seeing right now.   So a lot of people are learning as they go to each protest. I’ve seen people in these small communities in the northwestern corner of Minnesota who’ve *never* spoken out against anything - doing the hands-off protest was HUGE for them & for me because these are people in solid Trump-red country bordering North Dakota. Never did I think I’d see people with the courage to not only go against these red communities but to stand right on Main Street in these towns where everyone knows each other, and get out there in public to show their faces. That’s a big deal for these people, and person by person, small town by small town, we’re seeing the political winds shift.   These are poor towns where nothings happened for decades. Everyone has to have hope for something. To see people in towns I had written off get up and make their anger towards Trump known…that’s good. The key is where to channel that energy next, and how to use that power to make effective change.   I’m gay. I came out when I was 15 because I knew I had support at home (unlike most in my situation) and I had allies in my city. Because of those things I felt like I had a voice & I used it. It breaks my heart to see us backsliding into the bad old days after so many of us worked so hard to change peoples minds to not hate. 30 years after coming out I’ve learned it’s never over - the fight for your life, for other people to be free to be happy…and I myself am still learning how this works.

"This was all just a trail run. More citizens are already being arrested, and more citizens are receiving notices from DHS to leave the country. This was to see if anybody would even notice or care about a single innocent man, and gauge the reaction and to establish a precedent of going against the courts with no consequences. Even if Kilmar is returned safely, they’ll make sure to make an example out of them to make others fear to speak up. If he’s not returned, and the courts don’t have the power to enforce their rulings - then Trump will have nothing stopping him anymore from his rule by decree. If he faces significant pushback, he has a whole set of options that have already been set up by his extrajudicial team. He can just go ahead with his martial law plans. This has all been thought out and planned by the new deep state he created which is run by actual intelligent and competent people. It may not look competent when Trump is merely the frontman, but they absolutely know what they’re doing. Like the tariffs flip flop - it’s a great opportunity for the oligarchs to extract more wealth from ordinary Americans (it has NOTHING to do with geopolitics).

"It always is IMHO, because ultimately these movements are hollow. There's nothing constructive there, no concrete policies to make life better for its followers, no real ideology that isn't a facade around selfishness and hate.  If your entire ideological framework revolves around an ideal and unchangeable hierarchy based on identity, then social progress is not only impossible but undesirable. The whole thing turns into a zero sum game where you can only ""win"" by making someone else lose. But because things don't work that way in the real world, all they are left with is the brief rush when the other is made to lose.  So when they take power they don't govern. The only guide is the selfish interests of the politicians and their paymasters.

A criticism of Democrats is not an endorsement of Republicans nor should a response to criticism be a whataboutism type spin without accepting the reality of it all.   And, for the record, offensive airstrikes are absolutely an executive overreach. Congress didn't declare war and Libya made no offensive toward us or allies that would warrant a defesive response. There was no constitutional or legal basis for him to order those strikes, it violated the War Powers Act, and Congress has consistently abdicated its duty by not restraining the executive branch.   The way you responded feels like you need to slow down a bit. I'm personally tired of the rose tinted glasses type comments from individuals like I was responding to.

I first started going to protests in the late '60s where I took part in many anti-war and civil rights protests.

"Wow, I'm EXTREMELY impressed by your two comments here. I have not thought of this process the way you're describing it, but it absolutely makes immediate sense to me. I think you're touching on something very important here, but I sense that there is a deeper game going on right now. I think a large number of those installed within the power structure by this administration are even less qualified than folks such as Peter thiel and other conservative power brokers expected.              The timeline for project 2025 indicated that they wanted to achieve the vast majority of their goals within the first 6 months. The initial roll out of those policies has been impressively rapid, but I think what we're seeing now is a failure in the ability to follow through with the real world implementation of their programs. They obviously knew how to, in concept, achieve their desires almost immediately. Fortunately, it appears that the real world is not quite matching their models.        There is enough collateral damage to the general public's sentiment regarding this administration's actions via the idiotic implementation of the tariffs, the repeated security leaks, the overly brazen attitude towards the violation of due process, and the premature messaging from the president regarding the use of this due process nullification on US citizens that i think they may have seriously fucked up.              I don't think Trump was supposed to be speculating about doing this with citizens, yet. Making these kinds of fundamental changes to a government while also hoping to maintain the support of the citizens requires a bit more time and patience. If they had taken a bit more of a break between the renditioning of the first group of men to El Salvador and the sudden expansion of the deportees profiles, they could have mitigated a massive amount of this pushback. Doing so would have allowed them time to gauge the public and legal reactions, and adjusted their messaging around future expansion.        But they moved too quickly and got too greedy, and they've begun to galvanize a bit of resistance.       Heh, now that I've gotten this far in my comment, I just realized that the core of what you're saying actually completely applies in my analysis, as well. That inability to govern is being proven out by this hyper-accelerated timeline.

"High praise, but I can't really claim any originality here. When I said this was a bog standard reactionary populist movement then that also means I have the advantage that its predecessors have been extensively studied and thought about by people with a lot more insight in the situation. This analysis is mostly theirs.  I think you are spot on about the issues they have with competence and the haste with which they try to destroy the USA's institutions. Many people have noted that they're essentially following the fascist takeover playbook, but IMHO there are fundamental differences between the political context then and now. There is no militant left in the USA for one, so it is far more difficult to maintain support as the only people who can ""deal"" with them (as you have to first convince people that they somehow exist). They go after immigrants and foreigners as a substitute, but that doesn't conjure up the same dread and urgency among the more lukewarm supporters on the right. The only people who see immigrants and ""communists"" as the bigger threat these days are the hard core supporters and that's not enough. Without that, they will have a far harder time justifying the abuse of power, incompetence, corruption, chaos, ..., that is endemic to fascism and reactionary populism in general.  That doesn't mean the USA can rest easy IMHO. The reason they don't care about popularity is that they are authoritarians. They don't think people should be able to vote them out because anyone that is against them ceases to be a ""true American"" and is therefore an illegitimate political actor. They'll still try to cheat in any election that follows, so the most likely outcome is that you are going to have to force them out regardless of how unpopular they become. There's also the relatively high chance that they'll do something so self-destructive that it'd be the end of country as you know it regardless (e.g. start a war, attempt to invade an erstwhile ally). When they cross a line, an immediate response must follow because they have no morals.

"First. America, as we knew it, is long gone. The partisamship reached critical mass some time ago. We're not coming back from this whole.   Second, I give the chances of some Republicans remembering that they citizens not serfs even less of a chance than I give the military intervening. It might happen, but there is zero chance they vote to convict and remove him from office.   Third. Your last sentence is the worst option. A second civil war would never end. It would turn into Syria with sectarian violence and insurgency on both sides. This option is the guaranteed death of the Republic and would see the US balkanize as a best case scenario.

No. Fox news says he's here illegally and has ties to human smuggling. The courts say he is here legally and isn't a danger to his community. Provide the evidence to the court so they can evaluate it and change their ruling accordingly.

"Agreed. Pax Americana is dead. Even from a cynical realpolitik perspective what Trump is doing is self-destructive.  The whole point of the trade war was ostensibly to bring manufacturing back to America so we can go back to an export nation, that's why they're so obsessed with the trade deficit.   Except being a manufacturing and export nation fundamentally means the dollar needs to weaken. The dollar is strong, so its cheap as shit to import things we want and expensive as hell for other countries to buy our shit. If we want other countries to buy more of our shit, the dollar needs to fall. And it is indeed, currently falling...  ... and when the dollar weakens, our global hegemony weakens. Being the reserve currency means we get beneficial loans, we get more leverage in trade deals and treaties. Strong dollar means we can buy raw materials and parts for our military on the cheap. Strong dollar means we can do outreach to poor countries (like sending vaccines, medicine for AIDs, etc) to boost our soft power efficiently.  So I guess the question is... do we want to be a manufacturing export country, like China? Or do we want to be the indisputable military AND soft superpower afforded to us by the strong dollar? I guess MAGA wants the former. Except our current situation means ramping up to a manufacturing nation will take years, maybe decades. Might not even be possible, it might be a catch-22 situation where the falling dollar and trade wars just blocks us from the raw materials we need to even start building factories.   Not to mention factory work means we need more workers -- while we mass deport people. So.",Zombatico,2025-04-23T22:31:11,7
"No one’s going to do anything. Most people who have the means to act stand to benefit from keeping things the way they are. This isn’t the 17th century. The majority of fighting-age men today are battling depression, addiction, and crippling debt. The rest are locked into the system—family men, proud patriots, or beneficiaries of the status quo.  If an armed conflict ever broke out, it wouldn’t be R vs. D—it would be personal. A man pushed to the edge by a denied medical treatment, the loss of his family, or pure desperation. The U.S. is too developed for spontaneous revolt. Intelligence agencies, politicians, and think tanks are constantly monitoring, influencing, and deploying propaganda to keep things stable.  If even one shot were fired in a real uprising, the economy would implode instantly. Global militaries would brace for impact. World powers would pounce. We’re surrounded by so many fail-safes and power structures that the idea of radical change feels like a fantasy.  The truth is, most won’t fight for their country unless it comes with full healthcare, lifelong pensions, and immunity from consequences. Until the next election—or something truly breaks—nothing changes.",KingOfDragons54,2025-04-23T21:28:26,9
