"This article draws a constitutional and historical parallel between the transatlantic slave trade and contemporary U.S. deportation practices, particularly those proposed under Project 2025. It argues that the capture, extrajudicial transport, and indefinite confinement of unconvicted individuals— to facilities like CECOT in El Salvador where forced labor has been reported—mirror the structure of historical slavery. The analysis contends that such practices fall outside the 13th Amendment’s exception for punishment following conviction and may also violate habeas corpus protections. Framing mass deportations as a modern form of enslavement, the article calls for legal and moral reckoning grounded in constitutional principle and historical awareness.",D-R-AZ,2025-04-23T17:51:03,3
">Just as previous generations confronted—and ultimately overturned—the legal and moral abomination of chattel slavery, so too must we recognize and resist this new machinery of expulsion and extrajudicial punishment. **As courts weigh the legality of mass removals and indefinite detentions, the American public must weigh their conscience, the history of our nation and its future trajectory.**  >Will the United States allow history to repeat itself—not as tragedy nor farce, but as calculated policy cloaked in euphemism? Or will we intervene before this new slave trade fully takes root? Naming it clearly is the first step toward abolition.  We should have ""weighed our conscience"" in November 2024, it was so black and white, good and evil clear as day then.  I don't hold out much hope for the leaders in our society to have a sudden change of heart. This is a nightmare we are all having to live through because of a massive amount of cowardliness from our own government.",Brytnshyne,2025-04-23T20:24:36,1
