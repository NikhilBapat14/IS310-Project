"Trump is using wartime powers during peacetime in order to violate civil liberties.  He is trying to create a quasi-state of war in order to claim a series of international crises.  He is trying to disregard the rights of citizens, such as claiming that he is free to deport citizens to other nations where they will then be outside of US jurisdiction and have no rights.  He is claiming that those who criticize him are committing treason, a blatant distortion of the elements of the treason statute.    All of that is straight out of the fascist playbook.",I405CA,2025-04-10T00:25:53,855
"Trump is following the Hitler/Goering strategy:   ""All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country.""  Trump has claimed we are in an emergency and has invoked powers designed to be used in wartime. Except, we aren't at war. Calling immigrants ""animals"" and claiming they are ""ruining the blood"" of the country are straight out of Hitler's playbook.  Germany had just lost a huge war, although the people didn't really feel like they lost. They had to pay reparations and lost some of their territory, along with a big depression economically. ""Make Germany Great Again"" was used by Hitler.  The problem Trump has is that the US is not in bad shape, we didn't lose a war, the economy was doing great. How do you make America great again if it is already great?  So first Trump had to convince people that the US was failing. That didn't work very well.  Trump is using all the moves for fascism, right out of their playbook, but America isn't going along with it.",billpalto,2025-04-10T07:44:59,172
">the rise of cancel culture  This was not a government phenomenon. If people want to be critical outside of government of certain views, this is no form of authoritarianism in my opinion. Entertainers especially have always needed to understand that their celebrity is at the whim of the masses.  To me the most alarming thing is invoking ""National Emergency"", ""National Security"" and other special measures meant to apply to extreme and unusual cases and assumed to be used in good faith as a pretense to grab Executive power when no such case exists and getting away with it.

To your first point: You can’t be serious about “cancel culture”. The right practically invented it.

"I would argue against one of the evidences you mentioned. I wouldn't say cancel culture is a new thing, there's just a shift in what gets you cancelled. People would boycott cinemas if they showed movies with black actors as leads, critizising christianity could give great repercussions to political people and celebrities etc...   Going against the mainstream or the people in power has always ment a risk of being ""cancelled"", it's just a shift in what the mainstream views are. The word travels faster and more broadly nowadays, so the consequenses might come faster, but IMO it's not a new thing at all.   To your main question I think the recent events does resemble the traditional playbook for an authoritarian takeover. I think the main thing is the rise of propaganda, where just as around WW2 they found how effective propaganda was, we can see a big rise in propaganda on SOME now. And I think the solution is to find ways to implement laws on the internet as we do on the rest of society.  Another big thing is how Trump works to divide people, fueling hate against groups of people. ""Either you're on our side or you're the enemy"". So his supporters aren't willing to debate or consider arguments against whatever soluting Trump comes with, because whoever makes an argument against him must have ill intentions and is the enemy.",piqueboo369,2025-04-10T02:02:21,45

After that doctrine was dropped the news became polarized as well as our citizens.  Now, because we are so split the only way to get anything done is by executive order. A good example of this is that for weeks news and business stations have been talking about how awful tariffs will be for the economy.

"Yes and no.  I think it's overly simplistic to blame Trump for everything that is happening now.  He is wielding an unprecedented amount of executive power, and he is undeniably overstepping his authority in several key areas.  That is definitively an authoritarian tactic.  But also, he is wielding power he has otherwise been granted by past legislatures.  I think we as a society have gotten lax about how our government functions.  For decades, really, for the last century, Congress has abdicated more and more of its authority to the executive.  And, although Chevron deference has recently been overturned to some degree, for decades executive agencies were able to basically create their own rules and exercise a rather extreme amount of power.  Practically speaking, I don't necessarily think that is bad, in the moment.  But it does set the groundwork for a lot of discontent when someone else gets in and exercises that authority in a manner that's not desirable, which we are seeing now in spades.  Ultimately, it's far easier for Congress to pass a bill that says ""blah agency will be responsible for implementing provisions of this article"", and there is a selfish incentive to do so.  When they are nebulous they can't be pinned to a campaign or initiative, and they retain PR flexibility when election season comes around.  But what we've failed to realize or failed to properly assess is the fact that every one of those lines in every bill we pass is a deferral of authority of the legislature to the executive.   All in all, to some degree, we have spent the last few decades creating the environment that Trump is exploiting now.  Hindsight is 20/20, but really we should be significantly more critical and averse to the transition of power from the legislature, which is the most democratic institution within our government, to the executive, which being headed by a singular person is naturally the most prone to authoritarian ideologies.",ValiantBear,2025-04-11T20:55:18,2

"> So here’s the serious question: Do recent U.S. events — regardless of where you stand politically — resemble that historical pattern?  In a word, no.  Authoritarian takeovers do not generally begin with bringing on contractors to end large government programs en masse.    The focus on this particular situation is because Trump is unique in the sense that he doesn't fit all that well into the traditional authoritarian structure.  He doesn't have a military background, he's not detail oriented, and he's incredibly bad at his job. What he does have is a lot of people who will go along with his day-to-day lunacy, and it gives the appearance of some sort of authoritarian deference when it's really just sycophancy.   Trump says and does worrying things.  I don't like his pushing of the envelope on deportations.  I don't like him even offhandedly saying that we should look at outsourcing American prisoners.  I think he views the Constitution more as a suggestion, and has an unhealthy fixation on revenge.  Most of us have not seen multiples of these qualities in the White House at the same time in our lifetime.  But the people arguing that this is some authoritarian nightmare coming to life in real time should frankly read a history book, because it turns out that loud and incompetent leadership is similarly dangerous to authoritarianism, even if motivationally different.  > If not, what would it actually look like if it were happening?  Trump's issue, as it were, is that he's awful on everything.  FDR's internment camps were worse than the ICE deportations.  JFK using the FCC to silence critics on the radio was worse than Trump dismissing the AP from the press pool over the Gulf of America nonsense - heck, Obama attempting to remove Fox simply because he didn't like their coverage was worse, since at least Trump provided a coherent reason.  FDR taking control of the economy was certainly more authoritarian than Trump unwinding USAID.  The Patriot Act is still worse than anything Trump has done as of yet.  We tolerate a certain level of authoritarianism by virtue of allowing ourselves to be ruled by political animals.  We've also tolerated decades of consolidation of power in the executive in the form of both implicit (*Chevron*) and explicit (wholesale delegation of Congressional powers like tariffs) in the name of ""good government"" or ""efficient operations.""  The question, for me, isn't so much whether Trump is authoritarian or following some playbook, it's about whether or not the people who are crying foul *now* are willing to do anything about it.  Trump was similar in his first term, and we had four years to unwind a lot of it and not only did Congress choose not to, but a lot of the things that make Trump's behavior possible were *defended* by those now yelling about authoritarianism.  It's a real problem.  I worry not that authoritarianism will come from someone like Trump, a man who does not respect our institutions enough to maintain them.  I worry it will come from someone who claims to respect our institutions so much that they will stop at nothing to ensure those institutions retain their control and power.    The Trump simps by and large don't want that, and those who do are too incompetent to figure it out.  His opponents, however, are more worrying on both counts.",ClockOfTheLongNow,2025-04-10T08:35:31,-7

"No, its not an authoritarian takeover, its a cultural rejection of the status quo. Trump is simply a battering ram. Folks on the right, some moderates and even a few on the left (check out #WalkAway on social media) have gotten fed up with the status quo. Trump comes along with his classic loose cannon, ""you're fired"" approach and starts giving campaign speeches calling out the stuff people were tired of. He's not a stereotypical politician, he's a crass New York business guy who calls out what he doesn't like and doesn't tolerate bullshit. This isn't a ""new Trump"" or a hidden, secret agenda, he's been saying stuff like this for decades. I've seen interviews with him from the 80's and 90's where he's saying exactly what he says today. ""Illegal immigration needs to get under control"" and ""outsourcing american jobs is a dumb idea, we need to bring them back"".  Although we don't see any news about it in America, there are similar political revolutions happening all over the world.  \- Britain is getting fed up with their leadership, economy, speech policing and immigration policies.  \- Italy nominated a right wing nationalist as their PM. Her platform focuses on nationalism, anti-immigration, and skepticism of the EU.  \- Argentina elected Javier Milei, a staunch libertarian who gutted the government and opened trade. Argentina's economic growth has skyrocketed.  \- Germany's coalition government has collapsed, and they've seen the rise of the AfD, a nationalist group that rejects the current politics, is anti-immigration, and wants to remake Germany's economic policies.  \- Hungry's president Viktor Orban promotes anti-immigration and a rejection of the EU  \- Netherlands's Party for Freedom has recently taken a stronger hold, shifting towards nationalism and challenging the historically liberal consensus and rejection of the EU.  There are similar changes happening in France, Sweden, Poland, El Salvador, Romania, Austria, India and tons of other countries. In fact, in 2024, over 1.5 billion people voted across 70+ countries, and in *every* developed Western nation that held elections, the ruling parties lost ground. That's the first time that’s happened in over a century. The populist right made major gains, especially with young men, while the old-school centrists and establishment parties took the hit.  The global political landscape is changing. A mass rejection of the status quo, economic insecurity, mass migration, distrust in the elite class, failure of progressive policies, and rejections of global institutions.  Late last year and early this year, there were videos on my TikTok and Insta feeds of other countries having massive rallies and celebrations in the street after Trump won the election and again after he took office. Obvs it's just the algorithms showing me that. But the fact that there was a massive rally with thousands of people in the middle of Britain, India, Australia and other countries celebrating Trump's nomination?  That's massive.  So, no, this isn't an authoritarian takeover. It's quite the opposite, it's a mass cultural rejection of the authoritarian progressive rule by the elite class that we've been living under for the last several decades.",SleekFilet,2025-04-10T16:26:55,-2

But the source goes on to explain that they ""present themselves as the sole savior of the nation."" Well Biden, Harris and the DNC certainly do that.  3. Undermine Trust in Institutions -- Look at how much the Democrats have been undermining trust in the Supreme Court. Look at all the ""defund the police"" rhetoric.  4. Control the Media -- Much of the media is in lockstep with the Democrats.  5. Target Opponents -- Do we count arresting the January 6th rioters? Or prosecuting Trump? Eric Adams? How about when under Democrats the IRS harassed political opponents?  6. Capture Courts and Security Forces -- Democrats haven't done this, but they've certainly talked about it through things like court packing or impeaching conservative justices. As for security forces, any president of any party is necessarily Commander-in-Chief.  7. Suppress Civil Society -- Democrats can skip this one because universities and NGOs are already broadly aligned with them.  8. Exploit a Crisis -- Covid shutdowns, saying police violence is a pandemic on par with Covid (despite the number of unjustified killings of unarmed black people being less than 20 a year).  9. Change the Rules -- We've seen Democrats want to change voting rules, have Congress impose rules on SCOTUS behavior, etc  10. Rig or Eliminate Elections -- Ask Bernie Bros about this one, or look at how Harris became VP, or the 2020 census improperly giving blue states several more congressional districts and electoral college votes than they should have gotten, or the courts ordering states to create new majority-black voting districts.  Now ***none*** of this is to say that the Democrats are in fact trying to destroy democracy, I don't believe that they are. My point is that these kinds of ""here's their playbook"" things are utter trash.  There's no reason to think that what happened in Germany in the 1930s and 40s really tells us much about how a fascist takeover could happen in the US in 2025. We're a country that's got 5x the population Germany had, we have 50 states with far more independence and autonomy than Germany's subdivisions, the US economy (even with the current market volatility) is far stronger than Germany's and the average US citizen is much more prosperous, we're not crippled the way Germany was with their post-WWI debts, we have orders of magnitude more news outlets, we have boundless peer-to-peer communication, and so on.

He certainly has stronger authoritarian tendencies than any other president in living memory, though we haven't yet seen if there are lines his administration won't cross.

The struggle against the radical right is a long-term affair; total victory over the radical right is no more possible than total victory over the Communists. What are needed are deliberate Administration policies and programs to contain the radical right from further expansion and in the long run to reduce it to its historic role of the impotent lunatic fringe...  > Then, too, corporate funds are used to put radical right views on the air for political rather than business reasons; propaganda is peddled far and wide under the guise of advertising. H. L. Hunt openly urges big business not to rely on contributions to finance the radical right but to use their advertising funds. The Internal Revenue Service sometime ago banned certain propaganda ads by electrical utilities as deductible expenses. Consideration might be given to the question whether the broadcast and rebroadcast of Schwarz’ Christian Anti-Communist Crusade rallies and similar rallies and propaganda of other groups is not in the same category.  > A related question is that of free radio and television time for the radical right. Hargis Christian Crusade has its messages reproduced by 70 radio stations across the country as public service features, and Mutual Broadcasting System apparently gave him a special rate for network broadcasts. In Washington, D.C. radio station WEAM currently offers the “Know Your Enemy” program at 8:25 pm., six days a week as a public service; in program No. 97 of this series the commentator advised listeners that Gus Hall of the Communist Party had evoked a plan for staffing the Kennedy Administration with his followers and that the plan was being carried out with success. Certainly the Federal Communications Commission might consider examining the extent of the practice of giving free time to the radical right and could take measures to encourage stations to assign comparable time for an opposing point of view on a free basis. Incidentally, in the area of commercial (not free) broadcasting, there is now pending before the FCC, Cincinnati Station WLW’s conduct in selling time to Life Line but refusing to sell time for the UAW program, “Eye Opener.”  This playbook worked, by the way.

"I don't think Trump is any different from fascist leaders from the last century. I recently finished reading Dr. Ruth Ben-Ghiat's book *Strongmen*, and the similarities between Trump's personality, and his rise to power, are astonishingly similar to those earlier figures. Most of them showed no adherence to any political ideology earlier in life, and altered their policies to conveniently suit whatever they saw as useful. They all share an obsession with appearing ""strong"" and masculine, they all talked about themselves in wildly grandiose terms. They all share a taste for performative behaviors to satisfy their egos, and a need for public attention. Most frighteningly, they all rose to power spouting populist rhetoric, while quietly aligning themselves with the wealthiest elites (industrialists in their day, technocrats in ours).   The only real difference I find separating Donald Trump from the likes of Hitler and Mussolini, is that Trump's push for political power came much later in life. Even if you look at his first failed run for President, in 2000 as the Reform Party candidate, he was in his 50's. Most authoritarian strongmen start much earlier, and usually through military service.

Knowing that he did this gutting when Trump lacks the legal authority to do so *because he's being Trump's hatchet-man* makes it a real thing.  I don't think either of them should be assassinated.  There are right ways to deal with this type of thing, and the nation pulling its heads out of their collective asses is that right way.  That said, I wouldn't lose sleep if they were.  I don't think there's any reason I should have to.  I've been terrified of Trump since the 1990's when he still had the letter ""D"" next to his name.  And every time I say ""I am afraid Trump will X"", everyone says ""No, he'd never X.  That would be unconscionable"".  But yeah, that's not Musk.  I think Trump is far worse than Musk",novagenesis,2025-04-10T18:05:48,5
Inciting violence on people is bad. But let us not pretend Trump is innocent in this matter either. Trump through his antics has incited violence on Americans multiple times to the point they've had to get FBI protection from his followers. Key person coming to mind is the American voter workers in 2020.    Your point is valid but the rooting for assassination is two way here. Trump is just high enough profile that it makes the news when a crazy farts his way.,Sageblue32,2025-04-11T06:06:02,2
"Not only is the diversity and selection group of individuals severely lacking, but the actual number of participants is very low compared to prior studies. What's more problematic is that they also noted that their research cannot contest prior studies definitevely due to a lack of ability for them to discern group affiliation:  >However, although we had the statistical power to detect the effect of relative group membership, we did not have sufficient power to reliably detect differences in that effect between liberals and conservatives (see SOM, p. 8 for post hoc analyses), so we cannot yet claim a strong challenge to past research. We addressed this limitation in Study 2.Our findings are also consistent with the idea that the political empathy bias is explained by moral judgment.       >When someone feels low empathy for their political opponent, it is not simply because they dislike the other. It is because they think the other is immoral and thus (perhaps) unworthy of empathy (as in the work of [Batson et al., 2007](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/01461672231198001#bibr4-01461672231198001)). These findings are in line with previous research suggesting partisan prejudice is driven by moral judgment as well as dislike and dissimilarity ([Finkel et al., 2020](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/01461672231198001#bibr18-01461672231198001)), although in our research, dissimilarity did not play a role once moral judgment and liking were taken into account. These processes may also explain why liberals showed less empathy to outgroup members than conservative participants: liberals judged conservatives more harshly than conservatives did liberals, seeing them as more immoral and less likable.",BadHabitOmni,2025-04-10T20:07:17,4

"A few other studies were referenced:  >Accordingly, in research on political differences in *empathy*, some studies show that liberals are more empathic than conservatives: liberals rate themselves as higher in empathy than conservatives do ([Iyer et al., 2012](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/01461672231198001#bibr26-01461672231198001)), and ratings of empathy are correlated with support for liberal policies ([Waytz et al., 2016](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/01461672231198001#bibr40-01461672231198001), p. 62; see [Morris, 2020](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/01461672231198001#bibr32-01461672231198001), for a review). However, these studies frequently measure trait empathy for nonspecific targets, as in the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (e.g., “I would describe myself as a pretty soft-hearted person”; [Davis, 1980](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/01461672231198001#bibr13-01461672231198001)). Few studies have compared partisans’ empathy for specific targets ([Morris, 2020](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/01461672231198001#bibr32-01461672231198001)), let alone for each other. It may be that liberals’ general tendency toward empathy does not extend to disliked outgroups that they consider immoral (i.e., conservatives).  >One study has directly examined empathy for one’s political opponents. In [Hasson et al. (2018)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/01461672231198001#bibr22-01461672231198001), participants from the United States, Israel, and Germany rated their empathy for political protestors injured during a protest. These protestors either shared the same political ideology as the participant (allies), the opposite ideology (opponents), or their politics were unspecified. Liberal participants were found to have more empathy *in absolute terms* than conservatives for each type of target (allies, opponents, or neutral targets). However, liberals and conservatives reduced their empathy for their opponents by the same amount *relative to empathy for their allies*. From this research, one might conclude that liberals find it easier than conservatives to extend empathy to their opponents, or equally as difficult, depending on how that difference in empathy is measured.",BadHabitOmni,2025-04-10T19:58:54,4

"I think we're in agreement, but maybe using the word ""ideologue"" differently? In it's strictest definition, an ideologue is a person who is adherent to an ideology. Which is kind of uselessly self referential. So an ideology is defined as: a system of ideas and ideals, especially one which forms the basis of economic or political theory and policy.  So, I can see where your thoughts about Hitler and Mussolini having visions for their country could be considered their ideology. I was saying that Trump, like Hitler and Mussolini, doesn't have any consistent political ideology. He's not a conservative or a libertarian, the only consistency we see in him, is his relentless pursuit of his own aggrandizement and self interest.   ^((Sorry if this seems to be digressing into a semantics discussion.))

All of them get to a point where they see what is good for them as being good for their country. Hitler and Mussolini made historic battlefield blunders because they often made decisions based on their ego, rather than reality. All of them had the same habit of procrastinating important decisions as long as possible, then making those calls in sudden and often arbitrary ways.

This means that the state/local layer is now bigger in comparison to the federal than it was, giving the inaccurate appearance of a weakened executive.   However, the executive authority has ramped up. From setting ignoring court orders to using executive orders to skirt congress, he has set many precedents that strengthen the executive. He has peeled away some of the authority of the federal bureaucracy, as well as that of congress. He is currently attempting to lessen the authority of the judiciary.

"""and ratings of empathy are correlated with support for liberal policies.""  ""Liberal participants were found to have more empathy *in absolute terms* than conservatives for each type of target (allies, opponents, or neutral targets).""  All you had to do was read further and see that not only do ""liberals rate themselves as higher in empathy than conservatives do"" but have also demonstrated they are more empathetic ""in absolute terms"" than conservatives.  This study also states that there was no determination factor to whether or not a participant was actualy liberal or conservative, only that they assigned themselves a label... which is no less problematic than ""rating yourself"" as per empathetic response.  In prior studies, political leaning was determined via survey before the participants were given empathy surveys - thus their self-selection criteria regarding political leaning wasn't affected by self-perception bias. You can see how that is a problem in the study you've cited, right?  How can it be conclusive if the political leaning of the participant isn't conclusively derived? It's arguably worse than offering people surveys that ask them how empathetic they think they are... because the converse statement (which is equally true) to ""liberals rate themselves as higher in empathy than conservatives do"" is that ""conservatives rate themselves as lower in empathy than liberals do.""

"Yeah exactly. They were both committed nationalists, while Trump is uses nationalist rhetoric because it gets him a following.

Those are his goals and it’s pretty clear cut how different he is from former fascists.

It gives numerous examples predating your Biden example (I'm not denying both sides go too far with the rhetoric, but it's a bit ridiculous to act as if it started with Biden or that it is mainly a democratic issue when there are far more examples of direct incitement to violence from the conservative side, as well as more direct acts of violence). I could believe the rhetoric and even the tendency to violence have flipped in the last few months, but it is pretty easy to point to direct cause and effect with that one. I haven't heard any political leaders calling for an assassination. People feel that way based on the divisiveness of this country and dehumanization of both sides by the other. Sure, rhetoric plays a part.   But it is a far deeper issue than rhetoric alone. People have been growing more and more discontent with the government since the 80s, and it seems that is finally culminating in more radical views. I think the rhetoric is *a result* of this, not a cause. Yes, it does contribute and make things worse. But I think it's something that has only arisen in the first place due to leaders trying to appeal to a populist nature. Populist leaders are more appealing in times of political unrest. The problem is we have a largely inneffectual federal governance system that has progressively built more and more corrupt practice into legal action. We really sealed the deal with citizens united. That was what took incentive away from politicians to listen to their constituents.   In the current political climate, everyone hates everyone. So incendiary rhetoric is to be expected.

"Im actually happy iu said that. It shows me that youre consistent and this is a good faith converstion based on misunderstanding rather than intentional misrepresentation.   The military is an executive *agency.* Agencies differ from government. The military gets its orders from the executive, but it is a standalone entity. It is functional even if the executive branch is dissolved.   The executive branch of government typically refers to the rule making body of the executive branch, or the presidential office. Presidential authority has dramatically expanded.   While you can consider the military and other independent agencies a part of the *enforcement* mechanism of the executive branch, they are not part of the rule making body. All the rules they enforce are logical extensions of rules put in place by the executive, congress, or the judiciary. When we talk about the branches of government, we are referring to the rulemaking bodies, not the enforcement bodies. No oaths of office are made. Per the US constitution, all government officials must make an oath of office. Neither military service members nor appointed department heads make that oath, therefore constitutionally they are seperate entities from the government branch, even though they function under its supervision. Here's an article from Cornell Law that may help delineate the difference.   https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/police_powers  Essentially, the military *function* is a part of the executive, but the military itself is not. In the case of dissolving independent agencies, the federal government still retains all the same powers. They just dissolved the compliance body associated and delegated those responsibilities either to the state or to other federal departments. No actual federal power is lost. If they wanted to reinstate the department, the power to do so is there. Because the *powers* are part of the executive, not the agencies.  Tl;dr  You can provide a broad definition that military fits under the executive branch, but this broad definition is not the primary meaning of the executive branch as used colloquially.

"I'm still going to assume you're arguing in good faith and I'll analyze your arguments solely based on their merit, regardless of your lack of any sources to back up your claims.  >What? No, a federal agency is still the government.  The military is government.    If the executive branch dissolves, does the military dissolve with it? Let's break down this argument with formal logic.  The military is government. This statement can be broken down into three explicit implications that all are necessary to this being a truth.  1. The military is the military. 2. The military is government. 3. The government is military.  All of these are necessary truths for your statement to be valid. Now, let's replace military with 'A' and government with 'B'  1. A is A 2. A is B 3. B is A  (It is worth noting 2 and 3 should be represented as a biconditional in true formal logic, but I'm simply trying to convey the most straightforward meaning possible).  The logic you're using implies that in *every* possible scenario represented, the military and government must be the same thing. So, let's say the government dissolves. Where does this leave the military? Does it dissolve as well? Perhaps it could replace the government, making your logic valid. But perhaps it could be privatized and a new government could form. That would be a scenario where your conclusion is invalid. If we go back to formal logic, this is even more obvious.  1. A is B. 2. A doesn't exist. ~~3. B still exists~~  As you can see, the necessary conditions for your statement to be logically consistent cannot be met. Hopefully this elucidates the confusion somewhat.",Brickscratcher,2025-04-17T23:54:15,1
">It's not a standalone entity, as it exists solely within the executive branch construct.  It's part of the Department of Defense, a cabinet-level department in the executive branch.    It is organized under the DoD. But let's say the DoD gets scrapped, too. Does the military go away? Therefore it is a standalone entity, and the government aspect is *the power to establish a military,* not the military itself.  >If the executive branch dissolved tomorrow, the military *as an organization* might remain, but we would need to reorganize it under a different branch, or actually establish it as an independent body.  But that's really an academic exercise.  In other words, the military *as an organization* is not a part of the government.   >True.  And yet, Article II has *always* designated the president as the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Even with executive power expanding, this has always been the core of the core.  Core of the ~~core~~ corps.   Let's analyze this statement. The President is the CIC of the armed forces. So the president is indeed a member of the military who is also a member of the executive. However, these are two different roles. The constitution clearly delineates the roles of the president and the roles of the CIC. However, even as noted in the constitution, these are separate positions of power. The President, as the leader of the country, is given the final say on all military coordination. Just like he's given the final say on congressional bills in the form of a Veto. Even though the office allows for practice of an explicitly congressional power (lawmaking), it does not make him a congressional member. The founding fathers were very careful (and rightfully so) to separate the powers of the president from the powers of the CIC.  >Which is a distinction without much difference.  They are part of the executive branch, same as any other executive branch agency or organization.  Rulemaking is not what distinguishes one from another.  Yes, it is. The ability to make rules is a central tenet of governance. If a body cannot make rules, by definition it is not a governing agency. Governing bodies (those with rule making authority) delegate to either states or *agencies* (alphabet agencies, the military, etc. For example, just like we used to have no alphabet agencies, we had no standing federal military) the enforcement of those rules. Enforcement bodies, while part of government in a broad sense, are granted powers by government and are therefore separate. The powers of all the agencies are granted to them by delegation of the enumerated powers of the federal government. Those enumerated powers are part of the federal government, but the agencies are not. Again, as per the US constitution, all members of government must take an oath of office. The alphabet agencies and military have no such oath, and thereby, they can not be constitutionally considered legitimate government bodies. This, in particular, is why they are challenged in court so often.  >To be clear, when we talk about the branches of government, we're referring to the three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial.  There is not some amorphous fourth branch, and the few independent agencies we *do* have (like the Federal Reserve) have shared oversight between multiple branches.  I'm not arguing there is. I'm arguing all enforcement bodies are not government, and that only the powers granted to those bodies are part of government, not the organizations themselves.  >The Armed Forces absolutely have an oath, and have had an oath since 1789, as required by the Constitution.  I don't even know how you came to the conclusion that they didn't.  They have a service oath. You also ignored the alphabet agencies, which are the topic of discussion. You seem to be very good at cherry-picking pieces of information to match your conclusion without looking at the broader context (this is an observation, not an insult). Here's the broader context of the armed forces:  This is the governmental oath to office.  I, [name], do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.""  This is the armed forces oath  ""I, (state name of enlistee), do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. So help me God.""  Notice how the military service oath is, well... an oath of military service. US code 3331 explicitly states the specific oath that *all government officials must take.*   The armed forces are beholden to the government, so they take an oath of loyalty, not an oath of office. There are similarities, but they are not the same.   >That depends, of course, on how the dissolution operates, but I'm not going to quibble too much with this.  Agencies, however, that have assumed powers otherwise not specifically allocated to them that dissolve generally aren't expected to retain those powers even if the agency disappears.  Agencies DO NOT have assumed or implied powers. Those belong to the states, exclusively, unless otherwise delegated by congress to the federal government, as they were in the New Deal that created most of them. If they dissolve, *those powers still belong to the federal government unless they are explicitly delegated back to the states.* I believe this is likely the core of your misconceptions.   >You're using a piece on policing powers to describe the military... why?  Because the military is the federal power of policing. The argument applies to the state or federal level.   >Where are you drawing this distinction, specifically?    The government has the power to create or disband a military. That is the power of governance. The created body is simply an enforcement and protection entity granted explicit powers that belong to the government.  Apparently, I had to split this in two messages.

That's ridiculous to ignore. Come now, why would you ignore that if you are arguing in good faith?  But I am not surprised as you also ignore dehumanizing language.  ""Finally, in my own research, I find that dehumanization is more often an *outcome* of participation in violence rather than a precursor.14 In other words, people make difficult decisions about whether or not to participate in genocide based on their access to financial resources, who they’re being asked to kill, their proximity to extremists ordering the violence, and signals sent by local elites. But the more they kill, the easier killing becomes, and this is partly due to shifts in social perception. Although participants in genocide describe reactions that include vomiting, shaking, nightmares, and trauma the first few times they kill, over time, their physical and emotional horror at killing subsides. My research suggests this *cognitive adaptation* to violence goes hand-in-hand with a transformation in how ordinary killers perceive their victims. Dehumanizing propaganda can help with this process by providing participants with cultural narratives that frame violence as the morally right thing to do, and it can help them overcome their initial resistance to killing neighbors as a result.""

"> You're claiming that Democrats haven't accepted an electoral defeat since 1988 - that the United States has been in a state of governmental paralysis, maybe even civil war, for thirty-seven years.  No, I didn't claim that.  Maybe that's why there's confusion, the attribution of claims that I didn't make.",ClockOfTheLongNow,2025-04-11T10:11:18,1

"The FBI released detailed data on over 14 million criminal offenses for 2023 reported to the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program by participating law enforcement agencies. More than 16,000 state, county, city, university and college, and tribal agencies, covering a combined population of 94.3% inhabitants, submitted data to the UCR Program through the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) and the Summary Reporting System.  The FBI’s crime statistics estimates, based on reported data for 2023, show that national violent crime decreased an estimated 3.0% in 2023 compared to 2022 estimates:    * Murder and non-negligent manslaughter recorded a 2023 estimated nationwide decrease of 11.6% compared to the previous year.   * In 2023, the estimated number of offenses in the revised rape category saw an estimated 9.4% decrease.   * Aggravated assault figures decreased an estimated 2.8% in 2023.  * Robbery showed an estimated decrease of 0.3% nationally.    In 2023, 16,009 agencies participated in the hate crime collection, with a population coverage of 95.2%. Law enforcement agencies submitted incident reports involving 11,862 criminal incidents and 13,829 related offenses as being motivated by bias toward race, ethnicity, ancestry, religion, sexual orientation, disability, gender, and gender identity.    To publish a national trend, the FBI’s UCR Program used a dataset of reported hate crime incidents and zero reports submitted by agencies reporting six or more common months or two or more common quarters (six months) of hate crime data to the FBI’s UCR Program for both 2022 and 2023. According to this dataset, reported hate crime incidents decreased 0.6% from 10,687 in 2022 to 10,627 in 2023.    The complete analysis is located on the [FBI’s Crime Data Explorer](https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/home).   ",BadHabitOmni,2025-04-20T12:28:41,1

This was my claim:  > I mean, the Democrats refused to accept either of Bush's wins and Trump's first, going as far as to protest the electoral vote count in Congress.   The evidence is that the Democratic Party, in each of those losses, organized efforts to stop the electoral college count.  That they *failed*, often without the support of the Democratic vice presidents at the time, is not evidence that they accepted the outcomes, it's just evidence that the efforts failed.

"I can agree that that was a foundation. But IMO the difference is so stark that in essence it becomes categorically different.
