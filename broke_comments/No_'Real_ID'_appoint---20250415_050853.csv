"Real ID's are redundant to passports, fyi. The Passport card is like $30 and covers Mexico/Canada.",Right_Archivist,2025-04-15T05:49:48,20
This is more so because NJ's DMV is so so so so so so fucking bad post covid. EVERYTHING IS APPOINTMENT  Only certain DMV's do registrations others only do liscense others only do CDL and then the appointments oh my god. Most of the time you have to pick a DMV thats nowhere near you because they dont have any appointments available. And most of the time you get there and the DMV has like 3 people in it. They trat getting your license renewed or car titled like your seeing a dr or some shit.   Its the fucking worst.,CantSeeShit,2025-04-15T14:37:48,4

"The sooner REAL ID is adopted, the sooner it can be used as voter ID.  REAL ID has all of the variables needed to determine citizenship and residency.",BucDan,2025-04-15T11:12:21,5
"Can someone explain to me why, all of a sudden, just a driver's license is no longer enough to fly domestically?",Just_Confused1,2025-04-15T11:12:07,3
"Im holding off since i know im not flying anytime soon. I do think the appointments are silly, but i guess they need those few extra mins to check stuff.   In chicago, most need appointments, but there are a couple of places that dont...they are just further away to deal with.",AtomicFox84,2025-04-15T08:10:47,1

"Tell me about it dude, I was thinking about getting a RealID probably around 6 months ago but the website said I’d have to drive to a MVC almost an hour away  Whatever, I have a passport card I’ll just use that instead of dealing with all that BS",Just_Confused1,2025-04-15T15:48:32,2

It won’t be a problem except the NJ government sucks at everything and instead of slowly rolling it out so that all basically all drivers license renewals are RealID they have made it hard to get an appointment for it for years and now all of a sudden everyone is rushing to get it,Just_Confused1,2025-04-15T15:45:43,1
I've never had 1. Has made 0 difference in my life. Also have switched my license to the state I moved to almost 2 years ago now. Despite that being something they can ticket me for ive had to show my ID to a cop 4 times in that time period and none gave a shit.   If they start making it a requirement to vote then yea I'll spend the extra money on 1 but I dont see much reason to do so,Single-Stop6768,2025-04-15T11:44:48,1
"Can't speak to NJ but in CA, a real ID effectively says you are a US citizen, while a non real ID obviously doesn't. as to flying, I can not say, never been on a plane. But for things like firearm purchases it is required.",thatfordboy429,2025-04-15T15:22:04,1
