"As some of the other commenters have mentioned, the Constitution can be interpreted to protect LGBTQ+ (hereinafter: Queer) rights, but it is not written that way explicitly. Because of that, it's hard to answer your question comprehensively - the Trump Administration's actions will be constitutional or unconstitutional largely based on the context in which they occur.  SCOTUS has heard two main cases regarding Queer rights: \[*Obergefell v. Hodges*\](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2014/14-556) and \[*Bostock v. Clayton County*\](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2019/17-1618)*. Obergefell* held that a state statute barring gay marriage was unconstitutional both under the right-to-privacy line of cases (*Griswold, Roe, Casey*), and under the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause. *Bostock* held that Title VII, which prohibits sex discrimination in employment matters and arose from the Civil Rights Acts, does apply to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.  So, what does this mean? Queer rights to marry are likely protected generally under the 14th Amendment. Queer rights against discrimination in the workplace are much more constrained, because the reasoning of *Bostock* relied on the definition of ""sex"" when evaluating sexual orientation. Queer rights outside of the employment or marriage context are entirely subject to review, and Federal policies regarding grants, educational material, contracting, etc. can likely be changed without violating pre-existing law. Whether those changes survive a constitutional challenge is up in the air, but I wouldn't hold your breath on *Bostock* being expanded beyond Title VII.  Last thing, and it's quite important, the Trump Campaign was incredibly aggressive towards specifically Trans rights, not Queer rights generally. (You can quibble as to whether they will care about the difference now that they are in power). And Trans rights have *never* been evaluated by the Supreme Court. No constitutional case has posed that particular question, and there are relevant differences between being gay/bi/etc. and being Trans. The fact that Trans issues do include healthcare issues - which is somewhere the government has been shown to have constitutionally more power than issues of privacy - means that a policy banning healthcare for Trans kids/adults might survive constitutional scrutiny under this SCOTUS.  Happy to discuss further, but there are many more far more qualified individuals than I to ask on this. One such person is my friend u/oleanderclaire.

">And Trans rights have never been evaluated by the Supreme Court. No constitutional case has posed that particular question, and there are relevant differences between being gay/bi/etc. and being Trans.  I'd quibble with that. Bostock v Clayton County was a consolidated case that addressed both. Gerald Lynn Bostock is gay and so is Donald Zarda. Aimee Stephens is trans. Justice Gorsuch opens powerfully:  ""The statute’s message for our cases is equally simple and momentous: An individual’s homosexuality or transgender status is not relevant to employment decisions. That’s because it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex. Consider, for example, an employer with two employees, both of whom are attracted to men. The two individuals are, to the employer’s mind, materially identical in all respects, except that one is a man and the other a woman. If the employer fires the male employee for no reason other than the fact he is attracted to men, the employer discriminates against him for traits or actions it tolerates in his female colleague. Put differently, the employer intentionally singles out an employee to fire based in part on the employee’s sex, and the affected employee’s sex is a but-for cause of his discharge. Or take an employer who fires a transgender person who was identified as a male at birth but who now identifies as a female. If the employer retains an otherwise identical employee who was identified as female at birth, the employer intentionally penalizes a person identified as male at birth for traits or actions that it tolerates in an employee identified as female at birth. Again, the individual employee’s sex plays an unmistakable and impermissible role in the discharge decision.  That distinguishes these cases from countless others where Title VII has nothing to say. Take an employer who fires a female employee for tardiness or incompetence or simply supporting the wrong sports team. Assuming the employer would not have tolerated the same trait in a man, Title VII stands silent. But unlike any of these other traits or actions, homosexuality and transgender status are inextricably bound up with sex. Not because homosexuality or transgender status are related to sex in some vague sense or because discrimination on these bases has some disparate impact on one sex or another, but because to discriminate on these grounds requires an employer to intentionally treat individual employees differently because of their sex.

"Interesting! Thank you for the info! I really appreciate you linking the cases haha, I saw the Bostock and Obergefell cases being cited a lot in online arguments when I tried looking up my question earlier and it's nice to have a clear description.  This is a little beyond my question and veering into theory, but out of curiosity, what do you as a law student personally think would happen if a trans rights/discrimination related case was to be brought to the Supreme Court during Trump's term, something that seems exceedingly likely with how much of a highlight they have been in the news recently? Do you expect them to go against prior judgements made in something like Bostock where they said discrimination based on gender identity was equivalent to sex and therefore unconstitutional? I really don't know much at all about law but I am aware the Supreme Court is likely to be a lot more red in the near future than it was during Bostock's ruling.",FineAndDandy26,2024-11-24T21:48:00,1

"For one thing, sex is an explicitly protected class in the Civil Rights Act. It is not explicitly protected in the 14th Amendment. That seems like a significant distinction. Given that women were not given the right to vote until the 19th Amendment, I think it'd be pretty easy to argue and find that the ratifiers of the 14th Amendment did not intend to protect sex as a protected classification. In fact, in Minor v. Happersett SCOTUS found that the 14th Amendment did not give women the right to vote. Equal protection did not extend them the franchise and voting wasn't a privilege or immunity of national citizenship.

">Admittedly I've only managed to understand bits and pieces of this conversation as I'm only somewhat versed in Law  All good, friend. Legal prowess is not required and I'm happy to help reduce fear, and expand confidence in legal protections for this community.   >because of Bostock, discrimination against trans people would violate the 14th Amendment   Not per se (a legal term meaning but in and of itself). The variable here is whether the discrimination would be permissible or not, and if it's legally discrimination at all.   Let's assume no discrimination is permissible (examples of permissible would be companies with less than 15 employees, or forcing a women's sexual assault center to hire someone who is incompatible with their mission of providing a safe place for recovery). With that assumption, we're left determining whether or not a particular law is discriminatory.   If the government said trans people can't go to the doctor, that's discrimination and would not survive legal challenge. Unconstitutional. But if the government instead said that all facilities offering medical services just be registered with the state, and trans activists complained that many of their doctors are located in other states, and aren't eligible to register in their home state... that's very likely not discrimination (as it applies equally to everyone).  What the Bostock ruling did was change the level of scrutiny the courts must apply when considering a question of discrimination on the basis of gender identity. That ruling raised the scrutiny level to the highest the court can apply, called ""strict scrutiny."" This is the highest bar the government could ever have to clear, requiring the government to prove a law is 1) necessary and 2) is narrowly tailored to serve a competing government interest.   That might sound like legal slop, but it's very serious. I can't imagine a single compelling government interest which would require discrimination against trans people at all, let alone after being narrowly tailored.   >given the Civil Rights Act is not in the constitution doesn't the President and the Court have a lot more leeway in potentially going against it?  ""More leeway"" is probably technically correct, as a constitutional amendment would require 2/3rd support in the Senate and state House delegations... but there's a deep percent chance you get a majority of the House, 60% of the Senate, plus a presidential signature to inform the freaking Civil Rights Act of 1964.
