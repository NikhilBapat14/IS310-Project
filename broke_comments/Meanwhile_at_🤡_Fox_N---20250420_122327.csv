Do you all remember those tabloid magazines of the 80s and 90s? Headlines like “Alien Boy Takes Over New York City” and “Lose 20 Pounds in a Week with the Cabbage Diet”? We all knew it was totally fake journalism and for amusement only. I used to read them sitting on the pot at my grandma’s house. Um. Yeah. That is Fox News encapsulated. The issue is the followers of Fox News don’t even have the understanding to get the joke. Even Fox News anchors themselves know it’s all utter nonsense. If that doesn’t tell you something…. Not sure how they can even keep a straight face with their “reporting”.,Cheap-Commission-457,2025-04-20T18:18:04,3
