"Excerpt:   Dozens of TikTok creators are theorizing that satellite images show evidence of mass killings at El Salvador’s notorious Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, the prison where the Trump administration is sending deported immigrants.   The U.S. has deported more than 200 people to El Salvador since facilitating a deal with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele to indefinitely detain the deportees, most of whom are Venezuelan.   Among the prisoners is Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran national deported due to an “administrative error.”   The Trump administration, with support from Bukele, has so far defied a Supreme Court order to facilitate Abrego Garcia’s return to the U.S.   As the internet hears more about the CECOT, a red-brown pile visible in satellite photos of the otherwise pristine facility caught the attention of TikTok sleuths.    My view:Demand Investigation  Calming statements from prison officials in El Salvador or MAGA politicians will not be believed.  Yes brown/red piles of things in a red-stained court yard could be lots of things, say firewood.  But they could also be piles of bodies.  A visit from a human rights team from the UN would be believable....  Remember many Germans were poorly informed about death camps. Let's know exactly what the Trump administration is doing to the human rights of deportees.",D-R-AZ,2025-04-17T08:58:25,196
Is the reason they can't send those people back because they're dead? That would be the worst case scenario. Even the possibility that we could be talking about an American President sending his own citizens to death camps is making me very scared for the future.,AceGoodyear,2025-04-17T10:32:15,226
It's taken almost 2 weeks for this to actually start getting around.    I'm hoping that a media outlet will spend what it costs to commission current satellite imagery.,Searchlights,2025-04-17T15:25:39,18

"How often are satellite images updated?   If I view my house online it still has my old car, from last year, in the driveway.   Not putting it past this administration, or the el Salvadoran government to kill prisoners. Just raising a question about how often satellites update imagery.   Still, American citizens are in danger, in el sav concentration camps. These may not be new bodies, but they still look like bodies.",RippleMeTimbers55,2025-04-17T13:04:12,29

"No one has ever been known to have been released from CECOT. They won't let anyone see what's going on inside except under extremely tightly limited and controlled visits. They're sending a lot of people there, nobody is coming out, and they have no intention of ever releasing anyone. I believe  they are killing people there.

They’ve been calling for a civil war since Biden   But I think many in trump’s administration is studying Hitler. No joke   Hitler knew he had to train people to another country to keep home looking normal. That’s what he is doing first… but it will grow   It’s coming. They’re not even hiding it anymore. They want to send non-conservatives to prisons overseas without any due process. They openly say it.,ra3ra31010,2025-04-17T13:27:38,52
