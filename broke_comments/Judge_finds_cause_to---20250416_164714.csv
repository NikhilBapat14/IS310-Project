">""In the event that Defendants do not choose to purge their contempt, the Court will proceed to identify the individual(s) responsible for the contumacious conduct by determining whose 'specific act or omission' caused the noncompliance,"" he wrote, and that person or those people would be prosecuted.  In any other decade, that would be startling.  Judge is ready to put Trump cabinet in jail for criminal contempt.  What a message that would send, right?  Wrong.  SCOTUS gave Trump immunity, and Trump will pardon any crime of anyone in the exec branch.  SCOTUS wants to put the responsibility on congress to impeach.  But congress is just as sold out to the rich as SCOTUS is.  And SCOTUS chose to twist US Constitution into a pretzel in order to rule that our POTUS is a king above the law.  We need a mass impeachment event if we are ever going to get back to being a democracy again.  We need majority Dem house, and 2/3 Dem senate, and I'm not talking about the kind of Dem who has been voting with the maggots lately.",Tiny_Structure_7,2025-04-16T18:54:28,15
"273 seats in the house (if it‚Äôs the same shift from 2016 - 2018), & depending on whom‚Äôs running, absolute best case is 56 seats for the dems/independents (Petola in Alaska, Tester in Montana, independent from Nebraska, Brown from Ohio, Golden from Maine, Cooper from North Carolina, in addition to the normal seats we already hold plus Texas, Florida, & Iowa)!!! Absolute best case is 66 seats held by democrats by 2031",Famijos,2025-04-17T02:58:53,2

I don't know if enough senate seats are up for election then to pull this off.,Tiny_Structure_7,2025-04-16T20:59:06,3

"Turns out, wiki has a page on this: [2026 United States Senate elections - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_United_States_Senate_elections#:~:text=The%202026%20United%20States%20Senate,%2C%20to%20January%203%2C%202033.)  33 seats up in 2026: 20 R and 13 D.  So even if we won all 33 elections, we would only be up to 54 Dems, shy of the 66 needed. üôÅ",Tiny_Structure_7,2025-04-16T21:13:55,4
