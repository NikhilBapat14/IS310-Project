It’s not China’s war. Misleading headline. Trump started this and he owns it completely.   Trump’s tariff war,Pankosmanko,2025-04-23T13:49:12,8
"Trump has always been able to sell his losses as victories to MAGA, but I don’t know how he’s going to do that with this. This is bigger than the other lies and promises he never could keep. Saying he could end the war in Ukraine in a few days was idiotic and naive, but MAGA aren’t  invested personally in that. With tariffs Trump promised all those camo jacket wearing, Dodge Ram truck driving MAGA’s that filled those fields for his rallies a return of the glory days and they desperately believed him. Instead the rest of the world called his bluff and made America look like fools for even thinking we still had that kind of power.",regent040,2025-04-23T10:46:10,12

Trump wanted to feel important. Decided to fuck everyone just to get attention. He likes being called vs sitting on the toilet watching Fox News while eating a Big Mac.  The rest of the world realized he is an attention seeking idiot and ignored him.,grabman,2025-04-24T05:35:50,1

"Art of the kneel is hilarious. This is a rude awakening that we’re no longer the top dogs, and it’s all because of Trump. We haven’t been the top dogs for a minute now, but our image has always presented that from our military to our president being the voice of the world. However, with Trump and his DEI hires, our image in both areas has gone down significantly and so has our prestige. It is clear now that we are not the top dogs.",JoineDaGuy,2025-04-23T10:15:18,30
He has 9 more days to fold on the de minimis exemption. That's going to come well before the 90 day tariff pause gets extended another 90 days. Or indefinitely.,877GoalNow,2025-04-23T10:14:47,9

"Most definitely.  China is executing very long-term strategies and effectively has a command economy (and a command *culture*), and are pretty well-situated for a trade war.  The US is the opposite and cannot sustain this for long.
