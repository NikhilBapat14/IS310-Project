I can't imagine why someone would like to invest in the USA now. The orange turd clown attacked every single country on this planet except Russia...,NorthenFreeman,2025-04-23T17:02:31,23

"I believe it is too late to fix. Example: It took two+ decades to build the US soybean market before Trump's first term. It's gone. Customers--countries--made contracts with other countries, sometimes for less cost. Two decades of work, washed away by one egotist's complete failure to grasp economics.",redheadedandbold,2025-04-23T19:13:01,8
What an absolute fucking bellend. I wonder how bad things have to get before Congress does something about this cooked administration.,tightloose,2025-04-23T18:46:07,3
"The economy is just the start. Wait until the Amazon post office is delivering packages in coal burning cars, XNASA (owned by Elon) is still trying to launch reliably etc  etc.    That's what Poutin did,  sold off state assets to oligarchs.

"Is CNN just now aware of this? Even if trump were whisked away today, the damage to the US's reputation has been done. Once you destroy trust in something, it is very difficult to get it back; trust is not a faucet that you can turn on and off at will.  The entire world now knows that the US cannot be trusted any longer than the length of time someone is president. Our so called checks and balances don't work.",Kincherk,2025-04-23T21:02:58,2
The world won't trust the US until they see that we hold assholes accountable and put laws in place to prevent this shit from happening again. I doubt we'll ever do one of those things.,FarAway_001,2025-04-23T23:00:58,2
