They‚Äôd have to risk their own lives if they went to Gaza. El Salvador is just a photo op.,Szorja,2025-04-19T21:13:29,97
Do they ever think about helping Americans?,stonewallmfjackson,2025-04-19T21:32:01,71
"Another one trying the same thing, eh? Hopefully also told no and to kick rocks. She has zero influence over US relations with that country, and zero authority to make any special deals. So good luck to her.",ITrCool,2025-04-19T20:57:38,89
"It's a great point: none did. But let's be honest, El Salvador can more or less guarantee any politicians' safety, while Gaza, that's a full-on warzone, and Hamas doesn't care.  There's nowhere to go, and there's no one authority from whom an American could go to and demand hostages.  It's not a defense, because the Dems have shown almost no interest in getting American hostages freed, but the dynamics make it a lot harder to grandstand, even if they wanted to.",thatrightwinger,2025-04-20T07:53:30,12
They want to visit a country that is only safe enough to visit because of Bukele.,kaytin911,2025-04-19T21:51:59,34
It‚Äôs so convenient that democrats want to visit the gang member in his home country. No need to bring him back if they can all travel down to El Salvador for margaritas and photo ops!,space_face_mace,2025-04-19T21:19:30,116

Isn't it illegal for a US citizen to conduct foreign diplomacy? That's the role of the *president and state department* of which these people are not. Then again Jimmy Carter got away with handing over nuclear secrets to North Korea post presidency... North Korea didn't even wait until the ink dried to break *that* promise.,Nianque,2025-04-19T22:14:07,46

Well the only reason why they can go to El Salvador is because after locking up the gangs it's a safe place. Something they don't want America to do...,dankhorse25,2025-04-20T00:56:57,30

"First of all, this congressperson is from Oregon. Makes sense - that state might have the highest cases of TDS in the whole country.  Secondly, can Maxine even define a woman? I mean really - did you see that picture? Is it just me or is this a dude?!  Lefties just never learn.

"How can anyone, even the die hard lefties, think that the Democrats care about actual citizens.  They pander to every demographic every 2 years to get elected and then ignore them. Remember Biden's election and suddenly BLM was complaining that he wasn't doing what he promised them.  Truman got the law that desegregated the military but it wasn't till Eisenhower that it was actually implemented.   When are minorities going to wake up that the pandering to you is just that, hollow words and failed promises.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-20T11:31:56,1
