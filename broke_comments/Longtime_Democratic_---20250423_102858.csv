Don't even think about it Rahm Emanuel.,BabyYodaX,2025-04-23T10:56:26,13
"Good for him honestly. We really do need an age limit, heck even 75 would dramatically change the landscape.",FlyingRock,2025-04-23T10:33:18,29
No more Dick for Illinois,robmapp,2025-04-23T10:30:47,13
The key element here is he's bringing up age as a contributing factor. My gut feeling is he's trying to send a message to the dems about fresh faces for the party.,williamgman,2025-04-23T10:37:31,16
Lauren Underwood would be an amazing Senator.,kneeco28,2025-04-23T10:40:35,7

Don't forget Durbin was one of the 10 Senate Democrats who voted for the GOP funding bill.,RoadsideBandit,2025-04-23T11:37:43,7
Obama has the opportunity to do the funniest thing. I just hope it’s not Rahm Emanuel who replaces Durbin.,samhit_n,2025-04-23T11:04:27,3
He voted for the cr.  Fuck him,Automatic-Wonder-299,2025-04-23T10:35:30,7
open senate seat for a democratic politician with lots of experience and a strong name with a history of winning in illinois?  i think it’s time to send obama back to washington,mXonKz,2025-04-23T10:53:45,2
He’s a dick.,BiggieTwiggy1two3,2025-04-23T10:36:17,1
Maybe this means Section 230 won’t be repealed?,Some_Trash852,2025-04-23T10:45:29,1
I will always appreciate a fossilized centrist voluntarily. Best of luck to whoever young progressive wants to run for this seat!!,xXplainawesomeXx,2025-04-23T10:47:10,1

good riddance.,extra-texture,2025-04-23T10:56:06,1
That was obvious when he voted along with the GOP,Wild_Bake_7781,2025-04-23T11:29:22,1
Oh he listens to my email when I ask him to step down but not to vote No on the CR! /s  Illinois will send any sane Democrat to the senate. This is a great opportunity for a strong progressive to run.,LilytheFire,2025-04-23T12:12:31,1

"Race for his seat on the D side is between Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, who has like $21M in the bank for a Senate run, Rep. Lauren Underwood, and Lt. Gov Julianna Stratton. Krishnamoorthi's money will be very influential, but Stratton has telegraphed that Gov Pritzker plans to back her financially (though still subject to campaign contribution limits). Underwood's fundraising last quarter was sufficient for a House run but didn't really ramp up in anticipation for a Senate run, though Durbin may prefer her as his successor.",Isentrope,2025-04-23T13:24:48,1
 And I thought he was just Bidin his time.,PurpleData8336,2025-04-23T13:41:09,1
"If he's retiring due to stress from current happenings,good on him.Time to sour the mood.I wonder if Trump wants him investigated,and will exhaust his administration to make sure he gets none of the retirement money that could be used for Trump's vision for humanity.",LycheePrevious7777,2025-04-23T15:07:45,1
"Good riddance.   That's the last of the Vichy Democrats who would have been up for reëlection next year to announce retirement. There are still six Democrats who voted for the House continuing resolution that haven't given up.   Catherine Cortez Masto (NV), Maggie Hassan (NH), John Fetterman (PA), Brian Schatz (HI), Chuck Schumer (NY), and Kirsten Gillibrand (NY). All except the last are up for reëlection in 2028.",yo2sense,2025-04-23T11:06:54,1
"wait are there still democrats in the government?  where are they?  As a kid we didn't have enough kids in the neighborhood to play a full baseball team... so we had ""invisible magic men"".  hit the ball make it to 2nd base... ""magic man"" stood on 3nd and you went back and batted again.  You make it to 2nd the ""magic men"" moved to 3rd.   Democrats are like this now just basically 2 kinds, turnip huggers and ""invisible magic men"" who do nothing but go with the flow.",AdvancedFiberSystems,2025-04-23T10:41:39,-5
You know he’s salivating for this if JB decides not to run for a third term,Jellyandjiggles,2025-04-23T11:28:06,5
Ironically an 83 year old has been one of the strongest resistance forces in Trump's 2nd term.,ColeBeasleyMD,2025-04-23T10:35:12,20
He fought the good fight and collected expertise and Senate experience not found in younger candidates.  He is the Senate minority Whip. So let the fun and games begin.  I think there's a good chance that Schumer will follow him in 2028. Democratic leadership in the Senate is up for grabs.,rapidcreek409,2025-04-23T10:55:50,6
It still has Duck.,thieh,2025-04-23T10:35:55,6
It’s not a lemon party without old dick!,Prudent_Block1669,2025-04-23T13:27:01,1
He's signalling people to get engaged in politics and for young people to run for something.,Conscious-Quarter423,2025-04-23T14:14:12,2
Seems like it.  Hopefully if she wins we can keep that district.,Dunlocke,2025-04-23T11:10:29,1
One can hope she enters and wins in the primary. I worry Rahm Emmanuel will enter the race and will win because of name recognition.,Jellyandjiggles,2025-04-23T11:23:46,1
sez the pimply 20 something,realancepts4real,2025-04-23T10:53:42,-10
is that the only thing you remember about his voting record?,Conscious-Quarter423,2025-04-23T14:14:49,1
I live in Illinois and I hope so too but name recognition is a thing like with the New York mayors race and Cuomo. I’m hoping it’s Lauren Underwood as much as I’d like a Palestinian advocate like my rep Chuy Garcia or Delia Ramirez.,Jellyandjiggles,2025-04-23T11:26:33,1
Yeah mte. Fuck him. Wish we could have replaced him a while ago.,Jellyandjiggles,2025-04-23T11:24:41,3
"His career fighting for progressive causes far, far outweighs any criticism anyone should have for that vote.  People from Illinois appreciate him. Just read through his wiki. There's more good shit in there than almost any other Senator can claim over the last 30 years.",Dunlocke,2025-04-23T11:17:42,1
that's the only thing you remember about him?,Conscious-Quarter423,2025-04-23T14:15:58,1
After how the country thanked him for his last round of service? He doesn't owe us shit.,Etzell,2025-04-23T11:13:14,3

Gillibrand won her election without a competitive primary election.,Conscious-Quarter423,2025-04-23T14:16:26,2
ugh,BabyYodaX,2025-04-23T13:08:28,1
That is most definitely true! I'm a Bernie fan overall but none the less too many folks hold onto their position despite clearly needing to step down and an age limit is essentially fair because it's across the board and not a per person basis.,FlyingRock,2025-04-23T10:42:32,9
"Really, though, Chris Van Hollen is the only one who’s actually done something worthy of being in leadership in recent weeks.  Certainly more than Schumer flailing his arms in front of a camera.",DaySoc98jr,2025-04-23T15:09:22,2

In 2012 and 2018 as well. Hopefully that will change.,yo2sense,2025-04-23T15:37:10,1
Voters have become complacent and are disengaged from politics. Less than 20% turn out and vote in primaries. Old people vote consistently and reliably in every elections. Boomers vote for boomers.,Conscious-Quarter423,2025-04-23T14:13:40,1
