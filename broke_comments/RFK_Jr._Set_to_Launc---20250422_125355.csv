"Uh, this is poor reporting.  First, there is no mention of why or how.  There is no mention on if they are seeking full records with names, addresses, etc, or just the data points.  Fed Gov or not, they cannot simply access private records. Well records outside of certain systems. I mean, some States track prescriptions but you need to be licensed or otherwise have the authority to access.  Insurance plans, hospital groups, etc. can also share info in-group. If this is true, they would need warrants or consent for personal records.  However, they can access the pure data points, minus identifying information, if they nicely ask and make the proper requests.  That is standard for research.       The other thing that may have benefited from additional reporting is that why the fuck would they have read-only access to the data?  First off, there is more than one way to get a person's name off a screen.  And second, without being able to access the data in the raw, what is the point of doing 'research'?   No one in their right mind is going to stare at a screen and type in data all day, every day, for potentially years to capture all of the records in a format suitable for research.  And don't say AI.    Anyways, supposedly they are going to collect data on those with and without autism (because, you need a control group).  It is currently not understood if this means accessing every record of every person or not, but this is a concern.  Additionally, the current plan is to only allow a select group of researchers to access the data.  As I wrote above, legally, because you know, HIPPA, the data would de-identified and should, should, only be given with consent .... but most of us probably already signed or agreed to consent without the reading the fine print on page 37 of the form.",crucial_geek,2025-04-23T21:10:46,0

"Yes. It depends on the study, but roughly 70-90% of the risk of autism comes from genetic factors, specifically from the paternal side.   I was diagnosed when I was in elementary school, after my teachers asked my parents to have me evaluated. My dad was then also tested and he was diagnosed, as well.  I should mention that I have two older sisters who *are not* on the autism spectrum and neither are their husbands. My three nieces were tested and none of them have ASD, either.  Edit to add: It is not offensive at all! We learn by asking questions.",KikiWestcliffe,2025-04-22T18:37:15,6
"What it looks like is the for-profit prison system. All they need is land, fencing and collaborators to guard anyone who would attempt to escape. Have you seen for-profit prisons in Texas? They provide tents, and very little else. No A/C in 100+ degree temps for 6 months of the year, bologna sandwiches and thin oatmeal for food. When the purpose is cruelty, we have already perfected that shit. They don‚Äôt care about the health and welfare of a targeted group, that‚Äôs pretty evident by the illegal deportations of people within the territory of the United States and therefore protected by our laws, that are constitutionally owed due process being sent to, what amounts to, death camps in El Salvador. I was born under two decades after the end of WWII and my father made it his mission to teach us what happened during Hitler‚Äôs reign of terror. This is exactly what the Nazi monsters did, it‚Äôs happening now.",Theatrepooky,2025-04-22T20:37:19,3
"I guess my fear is, are they going to out autistic people? Are they going to blame us for mass shootings and other problems? I don't think we are going to go full Holocaust here, partially because that is expensive and time-consuming, but there is a long stretch of what we could get. Not knowing is the worst",Rosebunse,2025-04-23T05:53:11,3
Thank you! I didn't know that! It's interesting that your dad was diagnosed as an adult after you were.,BloopityBlue,2025-04-22T22:19:32,2

I wish I could tell you. These people do things that I could never think of,MrIrrelevantsHypeMan,2025-04-23T05:59:15,2
Well they are kidnapping people and human trafficking them to prisons in other countries for life imprisonment without being charged with any crime. So...,WoodenMarsupial4100,2025-04-23T10:25:29,2
"Let?? With armed ICE thugs already roving the streets of every American city, do you think they will stop because of a parent saying no? They will terrify everyone with force and a gun in your face. They will silence opposition with force, rounding up those who speak out into death camps as well. I had a friend who grew up in Berlin during WWII, no one asked for permission. Her father was forced to join the army and went to North Africa with Rommel, he was never heard from again. Her neighbors and friends vanished and she was told to never ask questions or she and her mother would ‚Äòdisappear‚Äô too. Neighbors informed on neighbor for money or status. We are a whisper away from history repeating itself.",Theatrepooky,2025-04-22T20:55:23,3
