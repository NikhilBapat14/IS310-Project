Maybe it’s time Both Republicans and Democrats start trying to work together instead of always trying to get a gotcha moment for the Media?,Oscarwilder123,2025-04-13T23:26:42,61

I will admit I was absolutely shocked when Trump introduced Whitmer in a recent event. Even saying nice things about her. It was a complete whiplash.  What's even scarier is that she is considered one of the top prospects for the future Democratic Party. She has done nothing but poor choices for Michigan. Her actions during the pandemic destroyed the economy even more so in that state.,GeoChallenge,2025-04-13T16:20:17,56
Maybe she is just camera shy. /S,letmeinfornow,2025-04-13T16:54:23,5

Who would want to kidnap that?  What a bizarre conspiracy someone came up with.,jackdog20,2025-04-13T20:51:01,-9
Lol that was not an innocent gesture on Trump’s part. He was purposefully putting a big ol target on her to feed her back to her own party.,nybadfish,2025-04-13T19:02:45,27
I just posted about that. Caught me off guard. That is Trump being Trump. He does it to Putin and every other potential adversary. He makes it hard to hate him to his face and they WANT to help him.  I think big Gretch is an extremist and a huge black eye to MI but I give her props for her decorum at the event. She was at ease and made good humor.,chances906,2025-04-13T16:53:55,17
Destroying her state's economy was like the least evil thing she did during the pandemic,The_Mighty_Rex,2025-04-14T01:35:42,6
