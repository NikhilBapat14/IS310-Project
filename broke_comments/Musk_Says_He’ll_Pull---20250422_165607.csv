"He's legally required to do so in May. This isn't some personal choice.

*From Bloomberg News reporter Catherine Larkin:*  Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said he’ll start to pull back significantly from his work with President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency beginning next month.

And installed his backdoor in case he needs more.,RawChickenButt,2025-04-22T17:01:07,23
And the easy access to wealthyfare.  Nothing like getting premium access to the taxpayer dollar trough.,Rude-Strawberry-6360,2025-04-22T17:01:29,5
Big Balls and all his mates are Elon acolytes. He doesn't need to be in the office to run the show.,ianjm,2025-04-22T17:25:58,4
His authority ends with May too.,Weak-Regular7772,2025-04-22T18:57:04,1
"Department of Getting Everything for his oligarch chums.  That's why they got all the data out of the NLRB. It has lists of employees who want to form unions, including data on how they voted. He'll be selling this to any billionaire who wants access to essentially blackball these people from jobs in their companies.  Or maybe he's just sending it to Putin.",ianjm,2025-04-22T17:26:37,6
I find that quite insulting.   Even the dumbest sheep I know aren't as dumb as those people.,Cat_herder_81,2025-04-22T17:41:05,2

"Well, Trump and his handlers too.",cliff99,2025-04-22T17:29:18,1
That’s a lot of wishful thinking. I think the corruption is so pervasive and so complete this time around that there won’t be a return to normal after. Especially if politicians continue to just try to get along with evil and seek self preservation and enrichment.,AmorousAlpaca,2025-04-22T20:38:41,1
Because he wants you to think he's making some sort of choice when in fact he's legally required as an SGE to leave the position after 130 days (May 30).,cowboycoco1,2025-04-22T17:44:41,3

"Porque no los dos?  He fired a bunch of folks in charge of regulating his businesses, then got a bunch of multi-billion $ contracts with the government to boot.  I'm sure getting paid - one way or another - by Putin is just icing on the cake.",o8Stu,2025-04-22T18:16:58,1
