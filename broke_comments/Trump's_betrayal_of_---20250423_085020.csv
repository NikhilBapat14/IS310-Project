"If these peace terms are as reported, they are a historic betrayal. Nothing in American history would come near to it. It would side the US squarely and definitively with dictatorship. It would mark the collapse of Western values across the Atlantic.  You can write about this stuff over and over again. You can print page after page and commit sentence after sentence, but the cold reality of the words still strikes you like a slap to the face. The brutal, remorseless logic of what is happening is almost impossible to bear. And yet, if we have any chance of getting through this period with our principles intact, it will be by speaking honestly and precisely about what is taking place.  An¬†[Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/22/trump-russia-ukraine-peace-plan-crimea-donbas)¬†news agency report ‚Äì rejected by the Kremlin ‚Äì says that Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg will hand a full US-approved peace proposal to Ukrainian officials during a meeting in London today. If that deal is as reported, it is a near-complete capitulation to Russian demands.  The core concession it makes to Russia is to grant formal US recognition of the Crimea,¬†[which Vladimir Putin invaded in 2014](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/russia-annex-crimea-why-putin-invaded-2014-what-happened-nato-annexation-explained-1424682?srsltid=AfmBOor6A7ifjiTyeye4pOLzDeSxaWvcC3g7TTQWNhbm1yD7wa7vYAzL&ico=in-line_link). People occasionally like to adopt a mock-realist tone and insist that Russia was always going to end up with Crimea. It was occupied before the current hostilities, so granting it to Russia would recognise what‚Äôs been an on-the-ground reality for a decade.  In reality, this would not be a reversion to the¬†*status quo*; it would be the creation of a new global paradigm. It grants an aggressive imperialist state territory precisely on the basis of its aggressive imperialist activity. It would be the first time since the end of the Second World War that a country in Europe has secured territory in this way.¬†[It is¬†a return](https://inews.co.uk/opinion/trump-putin-call-confirms-europe-faces-russia-alone-3593464?ico=in-line_link)¬†‚Äì a vigorous, rapid return ‚Äì to the world of the early 20th century, to an international order defined by might alone.  Ukraine has rejected this proposal. Its fight for Crimea is not just about its territory but about the territory of every state in Europe and the safety of every citizen in Europe. If Crimea is handed to Russia, the message is clear: you can invade, you can murder, you can terrorise, and you can ethnically cleanse. And then, when you‚Äôre done, the international community will recognise your achievement. It is an invitation to tyrants everywhere to¬†do as they please.  In addition to this, the US would offer de facto recognition of territory under Russian occupation since 2022: Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. According to the¬†[*Financial Times*](https://www.ft.com/content/5d848403-4a15-4592-888b-eb7b754ecb3a), Putin has jumped on this offer and offered to freeze the invasion along the current front lines.  Of course, he has. He‚Äôs not getting everything he wants, but he‚Äôs getting everything he needs.  Donald Trump‚Äôs next concessions to Russia are to remove all US sanctions on the country and open up unprecedented degrees of US-Russian cooperation. This is the removal of the chief Russian vulnerability.  Russia¬†is isolated from the international community at precisely the time that it is turning into a war economy.

It's yet another stab in the back and brings back memories of when the US unilaterally pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal.   We'll obviously try and dig deep to somehow salvage what's possible and make up for America's withdrawal, but I have a sinking feeling that America won't just withdraw and leave us to it, but that it will start to actively support Putin's war effort by sharing intelligence and supplying expertise and ultimately hardware to Russia.

"Here's my prediction: either Ukraine swallows their pride, capitulates, and makes unwanted concessions to Russia, which would lead to an end to the war on unfavorable terms but stop the bloodshed nonetheless, or Ukraine doesn't swallow their pride, demand that the war continues until they recover all their stolen territory, which could ultimately lead to an end of support from the US and a complete destruction of Ukraine.  I'm assuming the Ukrainian hope is that by continuing the war, the EU will eventually get dragged into a direct conflict with Russia and this would In turn, inflict some massive damage to Russia to balance out the damage done to Ukraine. This is all assuming that Russia doesn't take the nuclear option  and wipes out Ukraine, with potential retaliatory strikes from the EU if the fallout affects European countries.    The US aim to diplomatically resolve this conflict, while having Ukraine make some unwanted concessions is the best path forward imho.  While I understand the difficult position that Zelensky is in, at some point, one has to realistically look at the situation at hand, vet the available options, and choose the path that makes the most sense.

"There is a lively¬†[debate](https://samf.substack.com/p/putins-weak-spot)¬†about how badly pummelled it is. Some believe it can survive its economic problems fine. Some believe it is reaching a crisis point, but it is unclear when it will hit ‚Äì perhaps in five years, three, or one. Others think it is on the brink of financial disaster. The middle view is the most popular but is also the most vague.  We do not know how long the combination of sanctions and massive military spending will take to break Russia. But we know one thing: it is our chief advantage against Putin as the war slowly grinds away on the battlefield. It offers a deliverable plan for smashing the imperialist state. Trump is intent not just on giving Putin what he wants but on removing all viable Western opposition.  If enacted, US and Chinese financial support would flood into Russia, rebuilding its economy and replenishing its military. Frozen Russian assets would be returned, removing potential funding schemes to help Ukraine repair.¬†So, of course, Putin is willing to freeze along the current front line. He gets the chance to build back and can restart the invasion later, with the sure knowledge that a Trumpified US will recognise whichever territorial gains he secures in the second wave.  What is there for Ukraine? Nothing. Trump says it cannot join NATO ‚Äì a once-galling commitment that now seems basically irrelevant given that Trump‚Äôs hatred for America‚Äôs Western allies has effectively made NATO redundant anyway. The deal says ‚Äì and for some reason, this might be its most irritating part ‚Äì that the US will¬†not prevent Ukraine from joining the EU. This is not in America‚Äôs gift. It is up to Ukraine and the EU whether it attains membership. The fact this is even written is a sign that Trump shares precisely the imperialist attributes of the Russian President.  There is a supposed ‚Äúsecurity guarantee‚Äù, but no details about how it would work or any mention of US involvement. It states that Europeans will do some peacekeeping ‚Äì a recognition of Keir Starmer‚Äôs¬†[coalition of the willing](https://inews.co.uk/opinion/coalition-of-virtue-signalling-starmers-peacekeeping-plans-3596492?srsltid=AfmBOooGBihxUuSqeLhPP1WlPoSqwJwjZYskPnABURjri-LQdSMCFIPa&ico=in-line_link), which the Trump administration has spent so much time disparaging.  Ukraine cannot accept this deal. To¬†do so would precipitate its eradication as a sovereign state and initiate the complete abolition of the post-war international order in Europe. But whether it declines or not, we face the same basic outcome. It is the outcome which has been presented to us, over and over again, since Trump came to power. America is an ally of Russia.

That was effectively a reward for territorial conquest through genocide, codified into a so-called peace deal.

That said, EU and the global coalition attempting to keep them in the fight, and afloat for sure were betrayed.    3 pillars often used to define the US mission statement are: security, democracy, and prosperity.  Their democracy mission is often described as, ""Promoting and defending democratic values and institutions both domestically and internationally.""  This current action is diametrically opposed to defending democracy.  Instead, it's running; not walking; away from it.    I know there will be arguments about the EU continuing to consume Russian gas.  Unwinding the dependence, during the winter, is next to impossible.  Sourcing and transit takes time.  And, even on sourcing: Canada upped supply of LNG to the US to be shipped to the EU, to help ease them off Russian gas.  This is the root of now the alleged ""trade deficit"" that Canada has with the US.  It's actually a surplus without energy imports.  So, the betrayal toward the coalition is even layered.    We will all be digging deep to try to find ways to support Ukraine.

"> But Putin already has everything he wants, no? The alternative here is for Ukraine to take Crimea and the landbridge region by force. How is this realistically possible without a direct conflict between Nato and Russia?  What Putin wants is to remove Western influence from Ukraine. He invaded Crimea after the Maidan protests led to the removal of a Russian puppet government which was replaced by a pro-Western government.   The current war in Ukraine is a proxy war. The war itself is not about Ukraine (except to Ukrainians themself). It's about the West versus Russia. Western money is being used to deal economic damage to its opponent, Russia. It's a fight about global influence.  A fight, I might add, that the West is winning. Russia's economy is crumbling and analysts suggest that Russia simply won't have the economic capital to continue the war into 2026.
