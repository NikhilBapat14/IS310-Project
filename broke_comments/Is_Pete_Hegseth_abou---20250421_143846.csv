"One of the hallmarks of a Trump administration is a revolving door for cabinet positions.   So getting canned or being forced to resign in less than 100 days tracks.   I know that guy has military experience, but he was obviously unqualified to to lead the pentagon for ffs.   The reason Trump tapped Pete to begin with was to have a yes man in charge of the pentagon for when he wanted to use the military to violate the US constitution.

"10 mooches is a good run in the trump admin.  He never should have been hired in the first place. He was the conservative definition of a ""DEI"" hire, they had to change the rules because he didn't have enough experience to qualify for this role, and he's the first modern Cabinet pick for Defense that didn't meet these qualifications.

This man has been a walking PR disaster since the day Trump nominated him. It was already wild that someone with *that* Fox News background and zero serious leadership at DoD levels got confirmed in the first place. The Signal leak alone should've gotten him canned.

Everyone will be replaced with ""Acting"". Acting Secretary of Defense, Acting Transportation Director, Acting FBI Director and so on.

"Nope. Trump doesn’t fire people for incompetence, he fires people for defying him. As long as Pete keeps his knee pads on he should be safe, despite being a worldwide laughing stock. Firing him would show weakness, and Trump wouldn’t want to do that because he’s the infallible godking who doesn’t make mistakes.   That said, if he does fire Hegseth, it will be a very interesting sign, a crack in the facade of invincibility that Trump wants desperately to maintain.",Branciforte,2025-04-21T15:23:13,6

"Yes, this is a lot of scandal in a short sprint and there are frequent reports that the admin is tired of the distractions. Defense is not an area Trump, his inner circle, or his supporters take lightly and I’m sure there’s plenty of grief behind the scenes if we are seeing **any** amount of leaking from the Pentagon.   Also, thanks for calling out Thom Till’s last minute flip. He’s my senator and I’m disappointed that he fell in line with MAGA but I’m holding hope Tillis can grow back his spine in the future",qu4f,2025-04-21T17:53:14,3
"My guess is that Hegseth with resign and blame the media for causing Trump so much trouble. Hegseth will resign to spare Trump more distraction, he won't admit he made a mistake. Trump won't either, he'll blame the media too.  Trump doesn't want a competent and experienced Sec of Defense, he wants someone who will fire whoever Trump wants fired and who will follow illegal orders.   Hegseth seemed like the perfect person, except he is just too incompetent to even do that.",billpalto,2025-04-22T11:26:30,3
"I would argue that Trump won’t fire Hegseth, but not because he believes in him or anything like that.  Hegseth is blatantly unqualified to be the Secretary of Defence. I would guess this makes him easier for Trump to manipulate, considering he’s been massively over-promoted. He’s also an ex-Fox News anchor, meaning he will be a yes man to Trump, the one thing that Trump truly cares about in his second administration.   But most importantly, him not firing Hegseth, and therefore not taking responsibility, sets the precedent for similar acts to follow. Blatantly fireable or impeachable acts will be ignored. Trump is pushing Congress and his Cabinet for loyalty, he’s figuring out what can he get away with.",MiddleAndLeg_,2025-04-21T15:20:04,5
"We can hope. He is so comically unqualified. An insider threat that almost seems intentional. And seemingly someone so drunken that he had to promise not to drink anymore to get the position.   Like others have posted, it seems like the only reasons he even got the nod in the first place were his sycophancy and look.   The administration has gone to bat for him and swept away the first Signal controversy under the rug, but if the man’s own appointed underlings are resigning and whistleblowing that might just be the final straw.   Plus, he and DOGE have already done what Trump wanted them to do to the DOD. Cut large swaths of the headcount, fired or demoted any senior leadership that wouldn’t go along with it and killed any “DEI”.",InvaderDJ,2025-04-21T15:39:50,5

This sounds eerily reminiscent of the “anonymous staffer leaks” we had during trumps first presidency that turned out to be nothing burgers.   Hegseth is super popular amongst Trump supporters.

"I think it’s hilarious and hypocritical that everyone’s up in arms about Pete and his lack of regard for security, yet no one seems to complain about the reported who told the story to the press. If we look at the known instance of Pete being an idiot, I’d argue that the reporter who tried to make a name for himself caused more harm to national security than Pete did.  To be clear, I’m not defending Pete’s actions, they were reckless and irresponsible, but ultimately, they didn’t cause any actual damage, they could have but didn't. On the other hand, the reporter’s actions have had real, dramatic effects on foreign relations.  So which is worse: the idiot who should absolutely be held accountable, or the reporter whose actions actually caused harm?  Edited for clarity and further comment.  To be fair there is a process for reporting security leaks. If the report would have followed them, Pete's ball would be on the carpet, but the reporter wanted to get famous for it.   I can't stand these type of articles. Do you think that his brother, wife or lawyer shared this information, absolutely not. This is so outsider that was not part of it, if it even happened, and wanted to slander Pete for what ever reason.   At least the report used their name and claimed the situation.

The reporter's action could effect millions of people and has a much higher chance of actually killing people.  Pete’s actions do not justify those of the reporter.
