"From what I‚Äôve gathered, there‚Äôs no evidence linking him to MS-13 except one informant saying so.   Then again, I would assume 8th street vs MS-13 rivalry was the core of his deferment from deportation to El Salvador in the first place.   This really should have been settled in court, however.",LemartesIX,2025-04-14T16:20:41,2767

It‚Äôs not because anybody wants him in our country. It‚Äôs because we can‚Äôt set the precedent that it‚Äôs OK to send a ~~citizen~~ to prison in another country.

As long as they adhere to the leftist Orthodoxy they believe they ""truly care"" that's why when Gavin started trying to appear more moderate a bunch of lefty loons started calling him fascist or whatever. History will repeat itself and the left will get far to radical and either fizzle away leaving only moderates to run the party or they will try and stage some sort of revolution.

But I think real people see through this.  Republicans aren‚Äôt completely immune, they may oppose a good idea (if they mistakenly give an opinion and happen to be right) just to oppose the other side.

Also, El Salvador does not allow MS-13 gang members to be on the streets at all in their country, and they have agreed, this guy is a known MS-13 member, and they are saying that as their citizen, they do not wish to give him up back to the US.  All SCOTUS said was that IF El Salvador didn't want him, the US should facilitate his return for proper due process, to which he will then again, be removed, but he didn't get the due process. Since he is already in El Salvador, however, and he is their citizen, El Salvador has stated they do not wish to return him to the US as they see it as releasing an MS-13 gang member back into the wild.
