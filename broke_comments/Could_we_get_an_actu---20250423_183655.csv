"Due process is a single hearing to determine legality or not. Once you're positively identified and it's known you're an illegal alien you get deported. If we can't confirm status we can't deport you. It's simple. Obama deported millions, do what he did and stop the bullshit  Edit: Im going to add something else to this comment, Because I think it's important for people to understand There's no cap on The amount of people in the room for the hearing.  It is completely legal to stuff 50 of them into one hearing determine their status and deport them.",fordr015,2025-04-23T19:34:39,1317

"Citizenship is not just a legal status, but a fundamental identity that grants a person the full protection of The Constitution. To deport a citizen is not only a violation of their rights; it is an act of erasure that undermines the rule of law and the very principles of due process and justice the USA was founded on.

"Agree it’s somewhere in the middle. I’m against closed borders as well as open borders. We need rules and processes in place that are followed consistently.

"The elephant in the room here is that people in the US disagree, strongly, about who they want to be allowed to enter (or stay) in the country. At the two extremes are the full ""open border"" and ""closed border"" stances, and most people are somewhere in-between. But it's hard to have a real conversation about this stuff when there is strong disagreement about who we want to let in. Like there are people who are here legally but where large portions of the population don't agree with that legality (e.g. people who entered illegally, but had a former administration and/or court ruling allow them to stay legally, at least temporarily) but similarly there are people who are here illegally but where large portions of the population don't agree with that illegality (i.e. people denied asylum and/or work visas or other visas, where people want those statuses to be granted more easily or freely.)  If you disagree about the very fundamental issue, how are you going to ever resolve all the nitty-gritty? The reason people are fighting so hard on both ends is that they disagree with the result. Everything else is just politics.  I personally think that our immigration policy is too strict, and I realize that puts me at odds with much of this subreddit. My views come from many places. For one, I'm not particularly nationalist, I'd say I'm rather anti-nationalist. I don't like the idea of a person's legal rights and life opportunities depending more strongly on where they were born. I also think that nationalism (i.e. giving more weight to citizenship) tends to strengthen Federal authority and as such is at odds with my beliefs in small government. I recognize this is a minority viewpoint here but I do think it is a conservative/libertarian one especially in the American tradition. I just don't like the idea of the Federal government having more power, and I think there is an inconsistency in the surging nationalist-populism in the US, in that in order to have tighter borders, the state needs more power, and I don't like that. I think the state (i.e. the Federal executive branch) already has way too much power in a long list of  ways, and I want it to have less.  Also, on a practical level, I personally know a lot of people who have been denied entry into the US, had trouble with their visas, and/or was forced to leave. Each and every one of them is the type of person I would want to have here in the US: honest, hard-working, conscientious. And each has been law-abiding. Each and every one left when requested. But I'm sad. Some of my friends were forced to leave. One was forced to return to an authoritarian regime where he likely will have a lot less freedom and less opportunity. And then I look around me at people I have to deal with on a daily basis...U.S. citizens, many of whom are frankly not as intelligent, not as hard working, often...not having the best effect on our society. 4 people I know killed by drunk drivers. People who impose on me, hurt me, people who commit crimes, people who trash and destroy the public environment around me. Litter, property damage, nuisance. And I think...why are these people given all these rights and protections, just because they are lucky enough to be US citizens, and all my friends who are some of the most wonderful people, are fighting such an uphill battle to try to stay here? It doesn't seem right. And frankly it disgusts me and it makes me angry.  And lastly, I'm descended from immigrants, as nearly all of us are. My ancestors immigrated here freely and easily, and settled in lands that they had no history or roots in. If they were allowed to do that, who am I to refuse others the right or the opportunity to do that? Somewhere along the line, people's attitudes on this stuff shifted, for reasons I don't fully understand, and don't necessarily agree with. Honestly it seems knee-jerk to me and not principled. (I.e. ""I want mine."" which is IMHO exactly the attitude I hate most on the left.)  It just doesn't make sense to me, the anti-immigrant sentiment doesn't make sense to me based on what I see around me in my daily life.  I'm not saying to let everyone in, I'm just saying I think current policy is too strict. It's too hard to get asylum when fleeing an authoritarian state. One of my friends authors a publication in an authoritarian state that could get her jailed if she returns home, yet she was denied asylum. She ended up getting a work visa through her job, so she's still here for now, but it just didn't strike me as right, you know? These are the people I want us to be making space for and we are sending them the message that they are not wanted, not welcome here. People from Iran, Russia, Venezuela. Highly-educated people. We are making it hard even for them.  So that's my take, downvote me into oblivion if you want.  TL;DR: I think stricter immigration policy = big government.",cazort2,2025-04-24T07:55:52,63
"I think the burden of proof always falls on the accuser or prosecuting authority, in this case the government.  However, I think the stringency of that burden of proof is dependent upon the potential outcome... And that stringency defines how stringent the due process must be.  Much like how there is a different evidentiary standard in civil cases (e.g. a preponderance of evidence) than there is in a criminal proceeding (beyond a reasonable doubt), I think the evidentiary standard in the matter of proving whether someone should be allowed to remain in the country is different than in a criminal proceeding.  Simple fact of the matter is that the greater evidentiary standard in a criminal case versus a civil case is due to the fact that only in a criminal case can the punishment include an impairment of one's rights.  Likewise, because I view citizenship as a *privilege* rather than a right,(with residency as an even looser privilege) a deportation hearing does not ever result in an impairment of one's rights.  After all, if citizenship can be denied because you fail a written test, it cannot be a right on par with freedom of expression or the right to self-defense.  Which brings us back to the question of due process.  I think due process is necessary in any situation where there is an evidentiary standard... But when the evidentiary standard is reduced, the stringency of the due process likewise becomes less vital.  So....tldr... There should be some due process of course, but it does not warrant a full jury, and I tend to lean towards it not even requiring a bench hearing before a judge.  If the punishment was imprisonment rather than expulsion, I'd demanda full jury... But it isn't, so I don't.",Shadeylark,2025-04-24T07:03:17,14

(C)Violated nonimmigrant status or condition of entry  (i) Nonimmigrant status violators  Any alien who was admitted as a nonimmigrant and who has failed to maintain the nonimmigrant status in which the alien was admitted or to which it was changed under section 1258 of this title, or to comply with the conditions of any such status, is deportable.  (ii)Violators of conditions of entry  Any alien whom the Secretary of Health and Human Services certifies has failed to comply with terms, conditions, and controls that were imposed under section 1182(g) of this title is deportable.  (D)Termination of conditional permanent residence  (i)In general  Any alien with permanent resident status on a conditional basis under section 1186a of this title (relating to conditional permanent resident status for certain alien spouses and sons and daughters) or under section 1186b of this title (relating to conditional permanent resident status for certain alien entrepreneurs, spouses, and children) who has had such status terminated under such respective section is deportable.

"I was raised with the idea that we here in the US do not need to carry identification or documentation with us when we are going about our daily lives, unless we have a specific reason such as if we need a license to drive on an ID to enter a workplace, school, or other place where ID is required. And I was taught that being required to carry such documentation everywhere is a hallmark of an authoritarian state, and that during the changes leading up to WWII in Germany, the escalation of need to carry such documentation was an important warning sign of what was happening.

Either he was being wrongly harassed, or he lied in court and set this whole thing up, turning himself in to try to make an example out of himself as some sort of charade to try to discredit the Trump administration.

"Yes then after 6-7 years, we’re being gaslit into thinking it’s wrong to deport them since they’re established here and started a family. The real answer is detain them until this “due process” plays out, which shouldn’t take so long, but we don’t have the money or resources for this.

Meh just sent them back while the process plays out. If you were working security at an office building would you let them in while you verified their appointment or let them wait in the lobby?

Whether someone agrees with or cares about an amendment is irrelevant. People can be hypocrites or be acting out of purely selfish motivations but still have legal rights. Bad intentions do not invalidate constitutional rights.,cazort2,2025-04-24T16:43:56,2
">I was raised with the idea that we here in the US do not need to carry identification or documentation with us when we are going about our daily lives  I never said that. I said its not that hard for an actual citizen to present identify documentation. Don't try to conflate that with nazi germany or soviet union. That's some grade A, strawman BS. Most people tend to keep such sensitive paperwork, in a safe place. Its not the ""need to carry it"" rather the ability to to.  >as if we need a license to drive  Most people do in fact have a drivers license. In my state we have a ""Real ID"" which as you might suspect, requires more than one of the national identifying documents to obtain. Easy enough for a citizen.  That's the old democrat talking point about how hard it is to get a drivers license... its not.  As for your one case. Well, its paywalled, and I got shit that I need to get to, so I am not going to waste time bypassing. All I will say is, there is always going to be imperfection. Perfection is the enemy of good. And reading between the lines, it sounds like there is a lot more to that story. If I was missing for 1 day, if that, my family would be mounting a search. 10 days, no that's just suspicious as hell. Not to mention, if I just effectively needed to get some documentation to a court, I would have called said family first.",thatfordboy429,2025-04-24T18:10:52,-4

The UN also generally says (or used to say...) that fleeing gang violence, a natural disaster, or a tough economy is not enough to meet the definition.    It's not a Get Out of Jail Free card.

"Apologies for the paywall, I didn't realize it would do that, it allowed me to read it for some reason.

"Yeah, and if he sues and wins, the taxpayer will lose, and no one in government will be held accountable.  Of course carrying ID solves it but this makes an important point, which is that the US is shifting to a new status quo where everyone, including citizens, needs to carry ID if they don't. I was raised with people being pretty emphatic about the fact that in the US, you didn't need to carry ID with you (unless you had a specific need like a driver's license to drive), and that the requirement to always have ID or face something potentially bad happening to you was a hallmark of an authoritarian state. So I don't like this sort of development; it's not moving in a direction I like. Too much power in the hands of the Federal government's executive branch.",cazort2,2025-04-24T20:52:45,1

">But always about the alien act?  I don't understand your comment. The alien act was the method used for Garcia's deportation.   >Garcia is an MS13 member  This is a statement the left has challenged. It was taken to court but not proven, hence the legal stay but not the asylum status.   >Didn’t the Supreme Court ruled in favor of something similar?  See below for the first paragraph of the Supreme Court's Norm v Garcia:  >On March 15, 2025, the United States removed Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia from the United States to El Salvador, where he is currently detained in the Center for Terrorism Confinement (CECOT). The United States acknowledges that Abrego Garcia was subject to a withholding order forbidding his removal to El Salvador, and that the removal to El Salvador was therefore illegal. The United States represents that the removal to El Salvador was the result of an “administrative error.” The United States alleges, however, that Abrego Garcia has been found to be a member of the gang MS–13, a designated foreign terrorist organization, and that his return to the United States would pose a threat to the public. Abrego Garcia responds that he is not a member of MS–13, and that he has lived safely in the United States with his family for a decade and has never been charged with a crime.  And the meat of the decision  >The order properly requires the Government to “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.   So it's still possible he can be found as a member of MS-13, have his stay of deportation lifted, and be deported. But that has to be done through court, as it would've been had he not been sent to ES under the alien enemies act.
