"Altogether, the official said that there are 4 million borrowers who are in the late-stage delinquency stage on payments, meaning that they are between 91 days and 180 days late on payments.   “The Trump administration, [the] current administration, believes that American taxpayers can no longer serve as collateral for student loans,” the senior department official said. “Student loan debt must be paid back.”",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-22T09:03:17,42
They should ask their schools for a refund.,vampirepomeranian,2025-04-22T10:33:32,36
I don’t understand how so many people are in default when there are several repayment programs you can enroll in that make the payments really low or in some cases $0.,ancienteggfart,2025-04-22T09:17:33,22
What’s honestly shocking to me is that they hadn’t been collecting on defaulted student loans for 5 years,nukalurk,2025-04-22T18:15:52,6
Good. Glad I paid mine off a few years ago after the loan forgiveness for all fell through. Great to be debt free.,bulletorb,2025-04-22T12:00:49,8

"But Biden was gonna forgive ALL the student loans! /s  Fucking freeloaders thought they were gonna get off scot free, good",Enchylada,2025-04-22T12:51:34,-13
"If they were really smart, they could have taken the payment money and invested it in something relatively safe and liquid to make a little extra in the meantime.  On another note, I always get annoyed with all the people going on about ""just forgive student loans"" as if that fixes the problem and isn't just giving a blank check to colleges.",s1lentchaos,2025-04-22T08:46:09,43
"Anyone with a degree (in any major) who does not understand how simple interest works *deserves* a refund, because they did not get what they paid for.    Of course, understanding interest should also happen years before college even starts, but that's a separate thing.",NotAnotherRedditAcc2,2025-04-22T12:16:47,25
"Those are frozen in court right now, for the most part. A lot of these plans have been in administrative forbearance for almost a year",Chapped_Assets,2025-04-22T09:30:52,69
"It makes more sense when you realize there are plenty people spending hundreds on a pair of jeans and a thousand dollars on a watch before they *default on their debts.*  A lot of people aren't actually poor, they're rich off of gaming the system and they misrepresent their mass grift as a legitimate skill.  These people turn up their noses and glare downward at people who work with their hands and go home effectively empty-handed.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-22T10:00:02,-26

Its almost as if they're the kind of financial illiterate that would take out a 100k loan on a degree that has no chance of an ROI.,chii0628,2025-04-22T12:48:15,11
