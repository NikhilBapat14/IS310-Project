"The plainclothes guards were involved in the forcible removal of a woman from a meeting hosted by local Republicans in Coeur d’Alene, prosecutors said.  Prosecutors in northern Idaho have filed misdemeanor charges against six men in connection with the forcible removal of a woman from a legislative town hall meeting in February.  Theresa Borrenpohl, the woman who was dragged out of the meeting in a Coeur d’Alene school building by plain-clothed private security officers, also formally notified Kootenai County officials on Monday of her intent to sue by filing a tort claim notice.  On April 21, Borrenpohl filed a notice of a tort claim seeking $5 million in damages against several people involved in the incident.  “Town halls are intended to foster conversation and discourse across the aisle, which is why I am deeply alarmed that private security dragged me out of the public meeting for simply exercising my fundamental right of free speech,” Borrenpohl said in a statement announcing the claim.  The charges are:      Paul Trouette – four counts of battery, two counts of false imprisonment, one count of security agent uniform violation and security agent duties violation     Alex Trouette IV – one count of security agent uniform violation and one count of security agent duties violation     Russell Dunne – two counts of battery and one count of false imprisonment, security agent uniform violation, security agent duties violation, and security agent license violation     Christofer Berg – one count of battery, false imprisonment, security agent uniform violation, and security agent duties violation     Jesse Jones – two counts of battery, two counts of false imprisonment, and one count of security agent uniform violation and security agent duties violation  The sixth man, Michael Keller, was not affiliated with Lear Asset Management but was charged with battery in a separate incident. Police reports said he had an altercation with a woman who told police she was trying to get closer to Borrenpohl when Keller blocked and pushed her.   https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/us/idaho-coeur-dalene-town-hall-charges.html  https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/04/22/idaho-town-hall-woman-dragged/83197953007/  https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ap-us-idaho-town-hall-charges_n_6806edbde4b0c2071d3ece75",Inevitable-Peace7,2025-04-23T22:05:15,96

"Felony assault typically involves a weapon or serious bodily injury. I'm a former law enforcement worker who dealt with a lot of arrest affidavits, so I see the original charges. When you get arrested the officer initially decides what crimes to book you on, but the district attorney is the one who actually decides which charges they'll pursue in criminal court.   These chucklefucks will *probably* take a plea deal and get a slap on the wrist and most of the charges dismissed.",chromatoes,2025-04-23T22:38:54,94

I’m confused by your comment. You’re saying they should have been cops so they have the luxury of abusing people free-of-charge?,CariBlooms,2025-04-24T09:29:22,-4
"Somewhat - it's to start the legal ball rolling, first for the judge who sets bail terms.  The order goes like this - someone gets arrested, and when booking them into jail the officer has to submit an arrest affidavit (statement of what happened), along with which legal statutes they believe have been violated (the charges). This goes to the judge in the morning who determines what their bail options are.  After that, the district attorney's office gets the case and decides which charges they believe they can actually get a conviction on. During that time, the DA's office will usually talk to the defendant and try to get a plea deal arranged to skip the hassle of a trial. It's at this point where having a really good lawyer that *you* pay is quite important.  You're almost certainly fucked if you have to rely on a public defender who are massively overloaded with cases. This is a pay-to-play judicial system which is why I quit working in it.",chromatoes,2025-04-23T23:12:46,27
"Basically, yes. Only the prosecuting attorney decides on charges. Police officers only report what crimes they think they observed. This is why the idea of pressing charges is so disingenuous. Victims can ask the prosecuting attorney to press charges, or not, but ultimately the prosecutor makes the decision. Usually if a victim does not want to see charges pursued, prosecutors will drop it, as they need the victim statements to make a conviction in court.",Jboycjf05,2025-04-24T06:42:36,6
"That's not how it works. There's a difference between having a weapon and using one, and people aren't charged as a unit. I had a high level FBI NCIC certification so I actually know extensively about crime classification.  Fun fact is that to the FBI they'd actually consider false imprisonment as a kidnapping crime. The codes for kidnapping are in the 1000s and assaults in the 1300s, if you don't believe me.",chromatoes,2025-04-24T00:13:22,12
"Maybe so, but that's not how the laws work in this situation. Each person is only responsible for their own actions, the actions of other people don't typically apply unless there are special circumstances like an agreed upon premeditated plan (conspiracy).",chromatoes,2025-04-24T12:09:07,2
"If they take a plea deal, some charges will get dismissed because it's a negotiation tactic. The defendant will agree to reduced charges and in turn plea guilty or no contest, which means they can't appeal their judgment - they're agreeing up front that they are not innocent. It's like how a lot of civil cases end up getting settled out of court. You might not get as much money, but you don't have to pay as much to fight your case.",chromatoes,2025-04-24T12:06:14,3
No? That's such an insanely crazy reach from what I said. You're trying WAAAY too hard to look for alternative meaning in what I said instead of just taking it as face value.     I mean **exactly** what I said. Private security is a dumb idea because it doesn't have the protections normal police officers have. That's it. You don't need to read into it anymore than that because there's nothing to find and you're just gonna hurt yourself in confusion.,imnota4,2025-04-24T10:19:28,5
"With regard to the term ""press charges,"" perhaps the original meaning of ***a formal accusation*** hasn't been kept within the common vernacular. In this context, ***press*** is only meant to imply something between ***persuade*** and ***insist***. That use of press has kind of fallen out of use in common language, so the legal term is, like many other legal terms, a little bit archaic.  The only other term I can think of that uses press in a similar way is ***press gang***, which is also archaic by our standards. In that term, it's leaning more towards forcing someone to do something against their will. That use of the word still exists, but seems rarely used. We might say ***pressured*** instead.",PsyOpBunnyHop,2025-04-24T10:58:50,3
