"Crazy how the Germans and us are now allies, and us having US bases in Germany.  Hopefully these new tariff negotiations will result in *zero* tariffs between Germany and America, just like there is no tariffs between California and Texas.",GiediOne,2025-04-20T12:22:41,152

"modern left would be saying these guys are bigots.   they like to label anyone who doesnt agree with them Nazi’s.  when mainstream right dis-owns real racist groups that try to identify as republican.  the lefts heroes though being HAMAS, Domestic terrorists, and murderers.",Hulluck22,2025-04-20T18:04:31,-69
"WWII was a perfect recipe for how to decidely win a war and force capitulation, then occupy / rebuild it's government afterwards.   For some reason we abandoned the strategies that worked there in subsequent wars. ",Material-Afternoon16,2025-04-20T14:33:47,85

">For some reason we abandoned the strategies that worked there in subsequent wars  Nukes may have had something to do with it.  The other is probably culture as Iraq, Afghanistan, and Vietnam isn't exactly western-ish the way Germany and Japan were.",GiediOne,2025-04-20T14:43:29,69
"Every year it seems they are making war more anti-septic. More benign in the news and the eyes of the people.  There was a story about that in Star Trek TOS. A Taste of Armageddon.   War should be grisly, disgusting and worse than any horror movie. If it isn't then no one will sue for peace, it will become an ageless war, never-ending.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-20T17:24:53,6

"I agree nukes led to it, but our rules of engagement changed, we hold ourselves to a different set of rules than our opponents. It hasn't become about winning the war, it has become not being seen as bad. Our enemies don't have that hangup.   So it is essentially impossible to win a war when that is the mindset.",Dead-as-a-Doornail,2025-04-20T16:10:43,16
"They aren't, but every culture has a point. With Japan, it took proof we could instantaneously vaporizer an entire city in a single moment. Even then it took us doing it twice before they came to the table.    The development of precision guided munitions and associated rules of war really just made it so wars aren't winnable anymore. Maybe that was the point. But it removed a big sense of fear from the general population and it seems that fear is what led to actual conflict resolution and peace.    What Israel is doing in Gaza will serve as another good case study. I think they're motivated by a similar understanding.",Material-Afternoon16,2025-04-20T14:59:35,8
