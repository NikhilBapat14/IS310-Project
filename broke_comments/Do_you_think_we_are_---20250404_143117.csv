We are returning to history.  The post war order is the exception not the rule.  Check out the book - “The Jungle Grows Back” for an interesting read on where we heading.,siberianmi,2025-04-04T21:28:53,60
"I think we are seeing the ending of the American 'age' in real time.  Trump is openly tossing the current world order into the ash heap of history.  In the next decade we are going to see a fully rearmed Europe as they rebuild their military industrial complex to pull away from American influence.  We are going to see the fallout from the Ukraine war where entirely too many Russian Men died and the fallout from that.  We are going to see what happens to China after their demographic issues.    If the world decides to de dollarize, we are going to see a radical shifting of the economic realities and who knows where that ends up.  Note, the world economy shifting from the dollar is not the dollar getting tossed in the trash, it is the dollar losing its primacy and other forms of currency being likewise utilized as reserve in the role the US dollar has traditionally held.",tosser1579,2025-04-04T22:37:09,41
Yes but we are simply returning to history. The greatest Generation gave us one of the biggest gifts ever and that was global domination. Problem we don't just face one enemy anymore we face too China in my opinion is a much bigger threat to the United States than Russia and if Europe defended themselves they could handle Russia. If you need any more evidence of this look at who most South American countries did their trade with in the 2000s mostly us compared to today with the exception of Mexico and maybe two others most of them all trade with China. I would not be surprised if we grow more skeptical and cough cough imperialistic in Cuba as I only see it as a matter of time before China starts using their spy basis which they already have in Cuba to get into the United States.,Ok_Bandicoot_814,2025-04-04T22:27:29,11

"This is an interesting sub.  One of the topics showcased in my military leadership school was the concept of power projection.  The US is the only country that can do this.  We do it with our military and economy.  We studied the projection capabilities of Aircraft Carriers.  We have more than the combined total of the following nine countries.  Our biggest hurdle is our logistics and the ability to effectively field and refurbish equipment.  Our military posture is shifting from a primarily police-oriented force to one that is more strategic in defense and tactical in assault.  I agree that citizens are weary of boots-on-the-ground warfare.  While the EU will most certainly rearm, its force size and capability will be defense-oriented.  The hurdle to power projection is a significant challenge.  So much so that China and Russia have limited their operations to regional conflicts.",mcgunner1966,2025-04-04T23:01:26,2
"This was always the case. All regions in the world were dominated by local powers throughout history, often the same powers for at least the last thousand years. The U.S. was only a superpower because it had a lot of allies among those regional powers, like France, Germany, the U.K., Japan, Turkey, and so on, which allowed it to project its power oversea.  But the core of the European Union is basically an alliance between the regional powers that are French and Germany to peacefully and economically dominate Western Europe, which probably explains why the last regional power in Western Europe that is the U.K. was always reluctant to be part of it.   The Soviet Union was always the Russian Empire by another name, and the Ukraine war is now basically a proxy war between Russia and the European Union to control Eastern Europe.   The Middle East is dominated by Turkey and Iran, as it almost always was throughout history. The only other regional powers (Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Israel) can only stand up to them thanks to them having the backing of the United States.  East Asia is dominated by China and Japan, as it often was in history. Taiwan is currently in Japan's sphere of cultural influence, and China doesn't like that, therefore the saber rattling. But China is currently rather unpopular in the region, and most countries would probably side with Taiwan against them, except for their North Korea puppet.  I would say the whole of America is dominated by the U.S., including South America. That could change if Trump's antics undermine that power.   And Subsaharan Africa seems to lack dominant regional powers, apart from maybe South Africa.   But the United States cannot declare an economic and diplomatic war on the rest of the world, including their own allies, and expect to stay a world power. No country is that powerful, not even the U.S.",NekoCatSidhe,2025-04-05T11:26:22,4

"Ehhh, you're wrong insofar as there's alternatives to regional imperialism; consider the European Union as an example. Yes, Germany is the major economic power in Europe and has disproportionate sway, but it's a confederation of nations.     Spheres of influence, regional coalitions, spheres of influence disguised as regional coalitions, regional coalitions disguised as spheres of influence, that's what's going to be dominant in the next 30 years.     Since trade ties are so well-developed, and nuclear weapons (if you give me crap about BMD, I'll give you crap about cobalt bombs that can be detonated over your own territory, sterilizing the planet) are relatively common, there is a better chance that a system of global regions can develop into a fair and equitable system of global governance, instead of us doing WW1 again, because, seriously, WW1 with nukes?

"I heard someone use the term Balkanization in the last few days.  It's the perfect term for what is going to happen in the US. Regional governments will form.  The largest will be 'The Confederacy', consisting of Southern states plus those Midwestern states they are able to pull to their side. Might be some fighting as states which are strongly divided are contested.  Then there's New England. Pretty much exactly as it sounds, but might stretch all the way across the Great Lakes. It's possible, however, that the great lake states break off and do their own thing, either individually or in groups.  Then there will be what's already been called 'Cascadia' - California, Oregon, Washington banded together as one nation to claim the West Coast. Might get part of Nevada (Las Vegas) but maybe not.  Texas will form its own state which will promptly go bankrupt and start a war of conquest. It will take New Mexico (which no one wanted) and other loosely attached states.  Idaho will become an independent nation with Mormonism as it's official religion. Expect them to try to take parts or all of Montana. They'll fail - those people are vicious.  The big question is the Midwestern states, the ones that are mostly empty land. They might choose to remain their own states or band together.  There will be an era of territorial wars before the borders settle and new states emerge where once the USA stood.",cromethus,2025-04-04T20:46:55,-8

"> Trump is openly tossing the current world order into the ash heap of history.  We were already on a trajectory to ruin.  Had this administration not happened, by 2050 the US steel industry would be completely idled, and soon after, China would declare war and take Taiwan and Japan while the US was stuck rebuilding.    History is returning.  It was always going to return.  But at least now we're grappling with the problem directly.  Now, perhaps, instead of a war we definitely lose in the 2050's, we're probably going to have a Taiwan straits standoff incident in the 2030's, which we win.",SomeGoogleUser,2025-04-06T00:10:31,-4

"Balkanization is possible but not likely, and certainly not into anywhere near as many pieces.   Provided that balkanization does happen, it will happen with a limited intracontinental nuclear exchange. What nations come out of it will depend on what's left. Cascadia is a possibility. The Confederacy will exist for eleven Terrible minutes and then immediately be glassed out of existence. Most of the southwest/ middle north that isn't nuked will get annexed by Mexico/Canada respectively. most of the Midwest is where the particularly rough bombing will happen: lots of open space for demonstrative detonations that limit collateral damage in the short term, and lead to widespread famines in the long term.

"China doesn't want to take Japan, nor could they if that was their desire.  Trump is setting up US foreign policy to abandon Taiwan, so we aren't going to win because we aren't going to fight.  If we pull out of Europe... like Trump is actively angling for... we start losing fueling bases all over the world and that means we cannot send ships all over the world.  By 2030 we aren't going to be able to provide a meaningful defense of Taiwan and Trump is showing that there aren't any long term consequences for nations to grab territory in the Ukraine conflict.    If Trump is successful, the US will be back to a regional power with several strong militaries to content with by mid 2035.  We aren't going to be defending Taiwan, the costs involved are staggering.  They have maybe 10 years more of independence before they sign a treaty with China.    He wants us out of NATO and is actively pushing for the US to no longer be the supreme commander of NATO forces.  What's important there is that US law forbids US troops from being commanded by non-American commanders, meaning that if we aren't the supreme commander... we aren't effectively in the organization.  Europe is already working on an out plan for the US to be effective by 2035 if reports are true.  Europe is already moving away from buying US weapons and are in the early stages of reactivating their own military industrial complex.",tosser1579,2025-04-06T09:10:23,10
"China is a regional power. Not a world power. It will never be able to project power past Japan, Australia, and India. Why? Because it's authoritarian government will never give up power. Let's remind ourselves that US enacted the Marshall plan with a much smaller economy and those were grants. Not loans. China is not capable of doing that even today with a much bigger economy.    Russia is a has been nation, unless it reforms politically and merges with EU. It is doomed. Want to see what Russia looks like in the future. Look at Spain, once a European giant now a shadow of itself.   The issue with all these countries is the same.

"You're connecting some dots, but not all of them.    War has indeed decreased dramatically after World War II, and a lot of it was because of the American rules based international order that was established emphasized free trade.  As you point out, fighting is bad for business.     Of course, war still existed (and exist) post ww2, but deaths on the battlefield became a much lower percentage of overall human death than it had ever been before.  Not to mention the wars that happened tended to not be state on state declared total wars like was routine practice between governments for centuries.  Civil wars, terrorist action, coups, etc. have been muxh more doninant.   But you're prediction is far from inevitable. We're seemingly going backwards now because of what the current president is doing. Eroding the trust that Americans have worked hard to gain from are huge network of allies, and especially, disintegrating the vast economic networks of free trade!   There's a reason Warren Buffett said that tariffs are kind of like an act of War.  They are an extremely bad faith action to take against another country, especially since we are just taking them against other countries as a blanket (not certain products or certain industries for certain conditions, etc.).   The US has been essential in enforcing the rules of free trade that has prevented mass scale war.   There is no guarantee Europe will step in to do this. CAN do this, nor will anyone else. In fact, it's all too easy to see China or Russia get sucked into the power vacuum we create.     How will piracy be combated for example?  Right now the US Navy police is the waters and make sure they are safe for international shipping.  Before, shipping used to be a very dangerous game all over the world because of pirates.   Will somebackone ekse assume this roke? Or does it go to every man for himself?   So, your post struck me as odd.  If reddjt existed in the mid 20th century jt might seem appropriate.   But right now, we are going backwards away from that goal.     But the story is certainly not over.  There very well might be corporate backlash to Trump's policies sooner or later.  Corporations prefer stability and predictability.   His term has been anything but then.  Sure, billionaire tech Bros seem to be aligned with him at the moment.  But they do not represent every monied interest out there, and what they've shown publicly may only be a small part of the story.",eh_steve_420,2025-04-06T03:49:24,2
"China can want a lot of things.  Give China a decade and their demographics issues are going to be interesting.    We aren't going to defend Taiwan.  Listen to the republicans whining about the costs of defending Ukraine, and realize that Taiwan's defense is EASILY going to be 10x that.  The higher end estimate is 10 trillion if China actually tries.    I can see the democrats paying that, I can't see the republicans even pretending to try.  Given how shakey America is under Trump, I can't see Taiwan actually believing that we would either.  I'd expect a negotiated surrender inside a decade unless China implodes... which is also a possibility.    The pentagon can be prepared, they won't be using that plan.",tosser1579,2025-04-06T09:26:42,5

We are only their largest single national trading partner, the EU and ASEAN both are larger trading partners than we are and China is already moving to shift more goods that way.  Losing America hurts, it isn't going to kill them.   And again... China doesn't pay the tariffs, that is US citizens.  It will drive down the amount of goods the US buys from China substantially, but it isn't the kill switch it would have been twenty years ago.    China's issues are rooted in demographic collapse, they aren't at anything even approaching replenishment rate population wise.
