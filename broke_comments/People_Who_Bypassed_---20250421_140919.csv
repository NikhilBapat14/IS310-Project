"It still amazes me that we can kick out someone stopped at the border who isn't an American Citizen without having to get an immigration judge involved.  But you pick them up in Omaha or Albuquerque and now you have to make it into a show.  I like the idea I saw someone post recently.  Just onboard a ton of immigration judges, and make it a 24x7x365 affair.  Immigration judges are under the DOJ and don't require Senate approval.  It's entirely an executive branch function.",j3remy2007,2025-04-21T14:35:45,102

"The common theme in all of these strange developments is that the left fights for their interests every single step of the way, while the right's VIPs are mostly divided between pleasing their campaign contributors and pleasing the opposition while they tell their own base to shut up in either event.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-21T15:26:49,10
The only due process needed to deport an illegal immigrant is to determine their residency status. This is pretty quick. There's no entitlement to pursuing an asylum claim all the way up to the SCOTUS.,Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-21T17:57:44,8

"Or we could take advantage of our majority in both houses to pass real immigration reform legislation so we can be more selective about who we let in going forward.  Then we could look about how to legalize the desirable, hard working, peaceful immigrants who have been living here a long time.  I disagree that they all need to go.  It would be harmful to our country and economy and devastating to those affected.  I’m pissed off by what Biden and the Democrats did with encouraging illegal immigration, but that doesn’t mean we need to take our anger out on the immigrants.  Get rid of the criminals, but let’s have a more nuanced approach for the rest.",RedditThrowaway-1984,2025-04-21T18:07:46,48
That's a good idea. Unfortunately it doesn't seem like there is a cheap way out of this due to leftist lawfare. We probably have to play their game like that to prevent them from their goal of entrenchment and permanent harm to the country.,kaytin911,2025-04-21T15:46:04,-1

"""pass real immigration reform legislation""     That would require the congress to actually be useful, which they haven't really been regardless of which party in in control.",DonkeyMilker69,2025-04-22T00:00:19,16

"Can't do this without Democrat votes in the Senate. The unwillingness to work together, from both sides, is why Congress is a lame duck at this point.",pcm2a,2025-04-21T20:15:29,4
"Reagan was called the “Great Communicator” because he would be giving persuasive speeches relentlessly to sway public opinion and force reluctant congressmen to support his policies.  They called this the “bully pulpit.”  Trump needs to channel some Reagan and get more of the public and congress to support the agenda.  His tariff rollout is a disaster.  No cohesive plan, no communication, no warning - just a mess for business people to deal with.  Trump needs to do this better.",RedditThrowaway-1984,2025-04-22T07:26:31,9
I’d rather see a merit based system put in place so we can get skilled people and entrepreneurs in at a reasonable rate to benefit the economy as well as existing workers.  We are far from that now.,RedditThrowaway-1984,2025-04-22T14:53:26,1
"Trump is the first Republican president to win the popular vote since Reagan.  Pretty sure he's doing fine... A helluva lot better than any Republican since the end of the Cold war in fact.  In fact, is even wager that Trump is doing better in today's climate than Reagan would be; without the Soviet Union to call and evil empire, Reagan would be doing what Bush Jr did and trying to invent a boogyman, and like Bush Jr he would fail and hand the nation to the left as a result.  Republicans need to stop worshipping Reagan.  It's been two generations since the man was president and he's literally been dead and rotting the ground for an entire generation.  Time to move on.  The problem is not Trump... The problem actually are the Reagan republicans who would rather side with the left, because they miss the days of Reagan, than give Trump a win.  The problem isn't Trump... The problem is conservatives who think being conservative means pretending like it's still the late 80's.",Shadeylark,2025-04-22T07:51:04,-1
