"He was going through the legal process, ‚Äúcoming here the right way‚Äù as they say. So where is he? Is this sheer incompetence or ICE finding a loophole to deport someone they can‚Äôt legally deport? Is he even alive? And how many others have already fallen into this black hole?",Academic-Dare-7677,2025-04-22T09:05:22,28
How long until we get a story about an ICE agent that just trafficked some woman who immigrated here straight into his basement?   Easy to get away with if there isnt any due process and nobody is saying where people are sent.,anemone_within,2025-04-22T09:29:15,22
"Thank you so much for sharing this! I've been trying to keep up with stories of specific immigrants who were detained or deported, but this is a new one. I'm glad I know about this. It's good that the NYT reported on this, and hopefully the case will continue to get more media coverage.  This case shows why due process matters so much for people who are about to be deported. If Ricardo Prada V√°squez had gotten the opportunity to explain his situation, it would be clear that he committed no crimes and simply took a wrong turn as he was delivering food. But instead, he was lumped in with a bunch of other Venezuelan ""gang members"" (alleged).  My best guess is that he was sent to CECOT, because that's where other Venezuelans were sent. Although it's a mystery why his name isn't on the list of people sent there. (By the way, the fact that the US government never publicly released that list is highly suspicious.)  How many other people are like Ricardo? How many others have been lost?  >‚ÄúThis case shocks the conscience,‚Äù said Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration scholar at Cornell Law School. ‚ÄúI have not heard of a disappearance like this in my 40-plus years of practicing and teaching immigration law.‚Äù  >He added, ‚ÄúThis case represents a black hole where due process no longer exists.‚Äù",sachiprecious,2025-04-22T09:06:22,13
"> In late January, Ricardo Prada V√°squez, a Venezuelan immigrant working in a delivery job in Detroit, picked up an order at a McDonald‚Äôs. He was heading to the address when he erroneously turned onto the Ambassador Bridge, which leads to Canada. It is a common mistake even for those who live in the Michigan border city. But for Mr. Prada, 32, it proved fateful.  > The U.S. authorities took Mr. Prada into custody when he attempted to re-enter the country; he was put in detention and ordered deported. On March 15, he told a friend in Chicago that he was among a number of detainees housed in Texas who expected to be repatriated to Venezuela.    > Mr. Prada was among tens of thousands of Venezuelans who migrated to the United States in recent years as their country descended into crisis under the government of Nicol√°s Maduro.  > Despite having a few years of college, he did not see a future in Venezuela, his brother Hugo said. Another brother moved to Chile; a sister settled in Peru. Ricardo, the youngest of the four, migrated to Colombia around 2019 and worked as a private security guard.  > He and his former partner gave birth to a son, Alessandro, who is now 4. Mother and child returned to Venezuela in 2022, after the couple broke up. Mr. Prada supported his son and spoke with him regularly, according to his mother, Maria Alejandra Vega.  > In 2024, Mr. Prada set out for the United States over land.  > He was admitted at a port of entry on Nov. 29, 2024, after waiting in Mexico to obtain an appointment through an app, CBP One, which the Biden administration had encouraged migrants to use in order to reduce chaotic crossings at the southern border, and was allowed to stay in the United States while his case was considered.  > Mr. Prada joined Javier in Chicago, where he remained for about a little over a month until he decided to move to Detroit, according to his friend.  > On Jan. 15, in broad daylight, Mr. Prada found himself on the Ambassador Bridge, on a one-way road that connects Michigan to Ontario. At about 1 p.m., he sent Javier a text with a pin of his location. ‚ÄúLook where I am,‚Äù he said in the text shared with the Times. He added an emoji of a shocked face.  > When Javier next heard from his friend, Mr. Prada was at the Calhoun County Correctional Center in western Michigan. Using the CBP One app had allowed him to enter the country once, but he did not have permission to enter a second time and was subject to mandatory detention.",RevWaldo,2025-04-22T08:41:49,12

"Trump admin is creating so many different spaces for abuses of power to go unchecked. It's not just about protecting himself, it's about creating an environment of chaos his supports could thrive in. Not the fools tricked into voting him, the real fans.
