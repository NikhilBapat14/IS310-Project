"The issue was going to end up at SCOTUS anyway, good to see they are cutting to the chase and ruling on such a fundamental issue sooner rather than later.",SeemoarAlpha,2025-04-17T19:02:17,59

I'm worried that Roberts and ACB will backstab us. I really hope I'm wrong.,Fact_Stater,2025-04-18T04:34:02,8
So how do you think they will rule on this?   I think they will say borne here = citizen.  I would like to remove birthright citizenship because it is a draw for immigrants.  Then they use the new borne for family members to stay.,Longjumping-Note-117,2025-04-17T19:54:16,2
"Took long enough.  I fully expect this current SCOTUS to overturn birthright citizenship, but we'll find out soon enough",Enchylada,2025-04-18T00:31:11,4
I don’t trust ACB. Look at her adopted kids. She’s a closet liberal.,BlackScienceManTyson,2025-04-17T21:33:29,-19
I have read that too.,Longjumping-Note-117,2025-04-18T07:22:02,2
Robert's is Bush Jr's gift that keeps on giving.,WembyDog,2025-04-18T16:02:32,4
"well the real question is the meaning of the addendum, subject to the laws of the US, that is important, I think its meant to suggest that only citizens and slaves could then have children that become citizens. As a slave is subject to the laws of the US, an illegal immigrant is not, they are not here legally ergo they arent subject of the same laws. Yes everyone has to ""follow"" the law in the US but being subject of it is different, it was written in the 1860s so it will have to be something they decide on, I can only home birthright citizenship comes to an end, will go a long way to help solve the illegal migration crisis.",Stephan_Balaur,2025-04-17T20:52:56,11
ACB will want an exception for Haitians.,ILikeLiftingMachines,2025-04-18T07:12:55,3
I hope you are right!   BTW looks like the libs are down voting our replies.  So I gave all replies up votes.,Longjumping-Note-117,2025-04-18T07:21:19,-3
TIL adopting kids or having a kid with Downs makes you a closet liberal.... Somehow.....,cathbadh,2025-04-18T10:42:28,12
At least he gave us Alito,Fact_Stater,2025-04-18T16:06:07,3
Yes I agree and forgot to add it was written after the civil war for that very reason.  I am so curious how and when the ruling will happen.  Could be one of the most important decisions I will witness.,Longjumping-Note-117,2025-04-17T21:57:36,7
"for me I felt Bruen was the most important, but since every liberal state just ignores it anyway, i guess it wasnt. This probably will be more important just because it sets what is and isnt allowed in new births",Stephan_Balaur,2025-04-18T13:37:18,1
