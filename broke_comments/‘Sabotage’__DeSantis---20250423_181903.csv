Good rulers solve problems before they have a chance to happen.  Bad ones blame others after the problems already exist.,thieh,2025-04-23T18:26:14,16

"Being a native Floridian this dude is shit. He was Cheeto lite before Cheeto got reelected. He fought with Disney FFS. He went after the state universities and his GOP buds played along, before it was the norm. He tried to sell off the State parks ffs. Now that he is getting close to his end game term they are jumping ship. (2026)  I am hoping this is a sign of things to come for the GOP. The Floriduh midterms were much closer than they thought so the pucker factor is high..  To see this piece of shit being told NO makes me smile :) May he rot in Hell.",SingleRefrigerator45,2025-04-23T19:09:18,8

He is a total asshole. Mean as can be and super self righteous. His opinion of women is neanderthal. He is just a short dude with daddy issues. The dangerous kind.,SingleRefrigerator45,2025-04-23T19:13:09,6
