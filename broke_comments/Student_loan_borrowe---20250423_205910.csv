Honestly wtf is even going on with these loans?! They keep pushing and pulling and now I have no idea when I'll even be expected to pay them. This is so stupid. All because he wants to stick it to the poor while giving the rich free handouts.,Historical_Usual5828,2025-04-24T09:56:34,1
"This is why it took me 7 years to finish college.  I worked until I could afford a semester, wash and repeat.  I graduated WELL behind my friends, but with no student loan.",just_bookmarking,2025-04-24T04:51:20,-2

I mean at this point these people haven’t paid on these loans in **five years.**  Hard to feel that bad about it.,AaminMarritza,2025-04-23T23:16:21,-22
"It's not college that's the problem. It's the fact that these loans can't be removed in bankruptcy.   And the interest amount eats up most of your payments, so people pay hundreds each month only to see a tiny fraction of the amount owed being removed after paying for years and years.",Trump_sucks_d,2025-04-23T22:44:14,16
"Many of us, especially those who grew up in poverty, we sold by our parents and educators that college was the only path to financial success. We were children, so we believed them, and took on debt with the belief it’d lead to careers we could build our lives around.",AdGroundbreaking939,2025-04-23T22:42:09,20
Seriously. Why are we doing this to ourselves or our kids? It’s like giving yourself a handicap.,PickleBananaMayo,2025-04-23T21:13:59,3
Here's an idea.   Try harder.,obligatorythr0waway,2025-04-23T23:33:12,7
I’ve been paying for 20 years and I owe more than I borrowed.,babycatcher2001,2025-04-24T06:04:16,6
"It’s exactly the problem. About to have our first grandchild and looked into a 529. Just ‘testing’ a full 4 year, out of state, housing and text book option - $425k. The great, great grandparents would have to start the saving plan to have no student loans….and even that throwing a fair bit of money each month at the plan.",Big-Plankton-4484,2025-04-24T07:08:38,4
"The fact that it's difficult to discharge student loans through bankruptcy is what keeps the interest rates so low. Without that feature rates would be much much higher and more, perhaps *most*, former students taking advantage of them would be forced to declare bankruptcy.   The problem is not the banks. The problem is that we have a system that only works when the country has jobs with salaries high enough to live a middle class lifestyle while paying off significant student debt available for the people coming out of college every year. And America is no longer that country.   We need to either go back to having the government itself guarantee the loans (or issue the loans itself) or drastically reducing access to college for working class kids.",yo2sense,2025-04-23T23:19:06,-3
"I'd argue that college is extremely important for people looking for education or professional jobs and it's definitely worth the investment for those jobs. The issue are universities using that gate to a career as a reason to price gouge people.    However, if you're just going because people told you a degree is needed, you need to spend a lot of time reflecting on if it's right for you and to make a plan. A vocational school may be all you need. ",TailRudder,2025-04-23T21:45:42,5
The last 9 words is exactly the current admin's point in all of this.,uhohnotafarteither,2025-04-24T10:01:00,1
