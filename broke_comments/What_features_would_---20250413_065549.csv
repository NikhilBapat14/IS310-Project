I'd like to see the government employees responsible for facilitating responses to FOIA requests rehired. How's that for a start?,pdeisenb,2025-04-13T08:54:02,11
"The problem with any FOIA type act is that no matter what, you MUST leave loopholes for various very good reasons. This allows people to take advantage of those loopholes for ""good reasons"" when they are completely NOT good reasons. Or, and often the case, the reasons WERE good but have now changed or been suborned and are now abused. You see a lot of this particularly in Defense and Intelligence, though it happens elsewhere.  Oversight isn't really the answer, as a good majority of the time, at some point, someone's boss isn't either cleared for information or due to things such as patient confidentiality, can't know information.",Farside_Farland,2025-04-13T16:06:00,3
"For me, a great FOI law should make government transparency as easy as ordering pizza online. üçï Keep it simple, clear, and accessible.  Key features:  * Real-time access to documents (no waiting forever for a response). * Clear exceptions for national security, but not vague ‚Äúnational interest‚Äù loopholes. * Public officials' communications (email, texts, etc.) should be open for scrutiny ‚Äî *because if they‚Äôre texting about alligators, we deserve to know.* üêä * Transparency for lobbying efforts ‚Äî let's see who‚Äôs pulling the strings. * Protection for whistleblowers to keep the system honest.  Oh, and definitely **fines for delays**. If government websites can stream a football game, they can upload a document. üèà",Only_Economics7148,2025-04-14T02:47:11,1
I think literally every single thing the government does should be accessible by every single citizen at any time with the same ease as I access google.com.,Kedulus,2025-04-14T07:08:59,1
"any form of the freedom of information act might as well not exist if there's a single way to make some information not public. If military secrets aren't public, then suddenly everything's a military secret. If the CIA's doing classified operations that need secrecy, what if i'm the victim of that. Basically i want either unrestricted access to *all* information from anywhere in the government with no exceptions up to and including the public being granted the right to actively enter bases and black sites whenever we want *without* supervision to make sure they don't just not record information, or for them to stop pretending this act means fucking anything.",Anon_cat86,2025-04-18T17:16:45,1
"1. If it is paid for by taxpayers, anyone can see it upon request. The only exceptions are the things that create danger to individuals, such as revealing confidential sources.   2. Everything must be recorded and kept.",hblask,2025-04-13T08:12:37,1
"Ooooh I like this, as someone who does FOIA requests for fun.  Honestly, I'd like to see there be real teeth behind requirements to report. As is, there's a requirement that an agency has to respond within 20 working days. Virtually no one actually abides by that, I have FOIA requests that have been open literally for years. There's absolutely no incentive to respond to these requests.  Part of it is a staffing problem, part of it is a desire to cooperate problem.  Even before the Trump cuts, FOIA staff were pretty limited at most places so it's a lot of work to put onto a small staff. The other component is, for lack of a better term, institutional laziness. They just don't want to give up information so they err on the side of denials and redactions that have to then be challenged in court.",HeloRising,2025-04-13T16:32:34,1
"I'd like to live in a country where the state doesn't keep secrets from its people.  Other than impending military plans, total information freedom.",Slam_Bingo,2025-04-13T23:21:11,0
"from the NYT:  April 10, 2025  In 2023, companies billed Medicare for hundreds of thousands of¬†[urinary catheters that doctors never ordered](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/09/health/medicare-billing-scam-catheters.html). The next year, doctors collected billions from the government for pricey bandages that were sometimes unneeded.  Medicare waste has wide-reaching consequences. Even if patients do not pay the bills themselves, more spending by the government insurance program can increase future premiums.  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  I'm always frustrated beyond belief when I read stories like this. I'd like to see the names of the company administrators involved and the names of those in Medicare who allow this to go on.  At the very least, these people should be shamed publicly if not prosecuted having their wealth taken from them and sent to prison.  You'd only have to do this a few times and anyone contemplating THEFT like this would decide ""I don't want this happening to me!""  Do this for anyone in the government that traffics in waste, fraud and abuse or fails to do their due diligence.",baxterstate,2025-04-13T09:19:07,-1
"Problem with fines though is who is meant to pay them? If you fine a government department then you indirectly fine taxpayers. But if you fine people personally, then someone could just have scapegoats take the fine and sack them without substantive change.",Awesomeuser90,2025-04-14T03:43:02,1
Isn‚Äôt that basically the American FOIA in theory? The problem with that system is how do you make sure things don‚Äôt get over-classified as dangerous/confidential?,Ana_Na_Moose,2025-04-14T21:43:59,1
"Are you making requests of the federal government? Or of local government, or of state governments? And if local or state, which ones? Have you noticed a difference between them, and potentially different departments?",Awesomeuser90,2025-04-14T03:53:00,1
The list of people who have been victims of crime and their address and contact information? And those in witness protection?   Probably not a good idea to boil down the list of things not to disclose to a single item.,Awesomeuser90,2025-04-14T03:40:42,2
"Yes, to both sentences.  It seems government always has a way to hide their crap.",hblask,2025-04-15T07:15:55,2
"Mostly local and federal governments.  Most of them for local requests pertain to police activity in terms of figuring out where police money is going. For federal agencies it's pretty random, something catches my attention or I'll help someone else out.  There's a difference in that response times are somewhat of a crapshoot. I've had local agencies get back to me within a couple months (which is pretty fast for FOIA) and I've had them take literally years. Federal agencies are at least a little more communicative in the sense that they will tell you ""We're still working on this.""",HeloRising,2025-04-14T18:56:44,1
"Fair point.   My point is that congress is designed to facilitate bribery by obfuscating the process by which laws are made, allowing industry to regulate itself. our military, from the golf of tonkin to Iraq wmds, lies to us to embroil us in wars of foreign aggression. Private wealth funds think tanks to lie to us and their lies are given play throughout government, campaigns and media.",Slam_Bingo,2025-04-14T09:30:31,0
"The link I had in the description has a list of qualities that might be a good starting point. I would focus on a rule making the scope of exemptions, when provided for, interpreted narrowly and the right of access be broad. There are some judicial standards you can use, strict scrutiny is a relatively well known one that could be used as could intermediate scrutiny. As well, a clause can be used to state that even if it is normally prohibited to release information, this falls away if the public interest is in favour of disclosure like human rights abuses and corrupt acts.  It also needs a strong an independent commission to enforce it, often with summary fines for those officials who fail to do so, who can get someone fired for failures here, and who can order things be released over the head of the department's officials, and who themselves is appointed in an independent and neutral way and who themselves has tenure against arbitrary dismissal and who takes no orders from others on how to operate.",Awesomeuser90,2025-04-14T09:39:06,1
