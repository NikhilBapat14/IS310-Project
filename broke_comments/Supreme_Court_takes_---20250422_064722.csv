"Prince and Knight, as well as Maiden and Princess are both good books. We have them in our personal library and regularly read them to our kids along with all the other books we have. These people are snowflakes. Keep your religion out of our public schools. If you want a religious education, go to a Religious private school.",jackel3415,2025-04-22T06:58:26,19
"When Christianity pushes it's way in, the rest of us are told to ""turn our heads.""   The same ppl don't extend the tolerance they demand.",Crusty_Musty_Fudge,2025-04-22T07:07:58,14
"Every case before SCOTUS is important. But especially now in this administration.  I hope they are starting to worry about the power they've ceded and are thinking smarter, less partisan, now.",KungFuSnafu,2025-04-22T06:53:41,8
"Try as you might, you can't get rid of all mention of gay people in a child's life. Some Christians have turned into such delicate snowflakes they think they can mandate their views onto others in all arenas. I'm sick of it.",invalidpassword,2025-04-22T07:14:00,6
Such a stupid argument that it's a violation of their faith. It's a violation of my faith that it's a violation of their faith. ,kiramon53,2025-04-22T07:12:35,7
"“Many religions now come before us with ingratiating smirks and outspread hands, like an unctuous merchant in a bazaar. They offer consolation and solidarity and uplift, competing as they do in a marketplace. But we have a right to remember how barbarically they behaved when they were strong and were making an offer that people could not refuse.”  ― Christopher Hitchens",TintedApostle,2025-04-22T07:25:34,4
This is good. Finally all religious groups must be told that they don't have right that everybody must hide reality from them.,TomOttawa,2025-04-22T07:01:07,4
"I think a lot of libraries dealt with this by tagging objectionable books and then the parent could flag their kid's name to not be allowed to check them out.  If the child tries to subvert this by getting a friend to check out the book, that's the parents' problem, not the library.",Individual-Guest-123,2025-04-22T08:06:18,0
"the term snowflakes comes from the ashes of the incinerated holocaust victims appearing so thick as to be called, offhandedly, ""snowflakes.""  Just as it is an abhorrent use by the right, I find it even more so when used by anyone considering themselves left or liberal.",Individual-Guest-123,2025-04-22T08:01:25,-15
"The term ""snowflakes"" came from the floating ashes of the incinerated holocaust victims.   ""Oh, they are just snowflakes!""  Just so you know, and perhaps spread the word's real meaning to other so called liberals.",Individual-Guest-123,2025-04-22T08:03:24,-9
I have little faith that that’ll be the outcome here.,-BustedCanofBiscuits,2025-04-22T07:22:38,4
"Pretty sure that it comes from ""special snowflake"", from the idea that all snowflakes are unique",ForgingIron,2025-04-22T08:06:45,16
The term has been around way longer than the holocaust and that origin story is nonsense.,jackel3415,2025-04-22T08:04:03,8
"I’m gonna need a source to this claim that the word snowflake is derived from context in the holocaust.   In text form, please. No Tik tok or YT.",DelightfulAbsurdity,2025-04-22T13:26:15,2
That apocryphal origin story is just as much bullshit as the “blood of the covenant is thicker than the water if the womb” crap. ,Damn_Dog_Inappropes,2025-04-22T11:40:12,1
"Hey, you all want to talk like a maggot, be my guest. You feel compelled to reply to posts by using MAGA""S flash words, you are no better than them, IMO.",Individual-Guest-123,2025-04-23T06:44:57,1
"Snowflake has had various slang uses throughout history, some of which predate WW2. The currently popular use has nothing to do with the Holocaust. Put away your fabricated outrage and find something useful to be mad about.",DartTheDragoon,2025-04-22T08:09:20,11
"Most of SCOTUS are religious nutters, so it’s fairly obvious how this is going to play out.",Emory27,2025-04-22T09:39:53,2
"Perhaps, but it originated with MAGAs and I find liberals using it distasteful.  The word, ""crybabies"", etc would not bother me in the least.   In fact, I am not sure why the left has latched onto the use of ""snowflakes"".   How about Lunatics? That is one I would certainly turn on the right at this point. Or maybe some would find that offensive to the mentally ill.   And if the term ""snowflake"" is referring to the nature of snow, you being from Canada should be well aware that a bunch of them can surely screw your life up for a few days. Then they evaporate and are reborn as more snow. (or maybe rain)  IOW, I find the use of the word to describe a person as extremely irritating.   Doesn't say much about the person using it, either.",Individual-Guest-123,2025-04-22T08:40:56,-5
"You could also say that about the swastika.  But, you want to adopt a word used by the right wing nut jobs, be my guest. I will continue to cringe every time I see it posted, especially by someone who claims to be liberal. Free speech, and all that...",Individual-Guest-123,2025-04-22T08:43:41,-2
"There are stories from survivors describing how the incinerator ashes fell like snowflakes. Then we have a huge amount of people denying that is the case.   IF you want to mimic MAGA talking points, be my  guest. I also don't like the use of the term ""Karen"". I am free to say that. And call out people for their nastiness. People that talk like that are no better than the right wing nut jobs, if that is how you want to be perceived, it is your choice.",Individual-Guest-123,2025-04-23T06:41:36,1
"Because it makes reps mad we use their word against them. If calling them lunatics worked, we would have done that. This is the party of ""can dish it but cant take it"" soo",JohnJohn173,2025-04-22T08:42:37,6
"It's bc they called us millenials snowflakes.  That was before we knew that every accusation was an admission.  So, they ARE snowflakes - by their own admission.",jakktrent,2025-04-22T09:03:04,3
The left has a bad problem where whenever the right appropriates something it becomes irrevocably tainted and anyone who uses it innocently or in a reclaimed way gets accused of dogwhistling. As a neopagan I have had *way* too much experience with this.,ForgingIron,2025-04-22T09:18:35,2
The difference is no historical evidence the term “snowflake” was ever used to refer to ashes. I don’t know where you heard that. While there is a huge amount of evidence regarding the appropriation of the swastika for use as a nazi symbol.,jackel3415,2025-04-22T08:52:42,2
"The swastika isn't a nazi symbol - it's the symbol of life in Hindu and eastern religions.  Hitler flipped it anyways.   If the word snowflakes hurts a Trumper - and it does, bc its their rhetoric and they don't know how to handle ""a sissy liberal"" using their rhetoric against them, especially when it's so obviously works on them. Thats some mental gymnastics they have to do every time they encounter it.  I've been using Trump is weak, I've said things like Trump lost his mancard to Elmos 4 old when he talked over him in the oval office, bc he is little bitch beta - I don't actually think like that or see the world thru those lenses but it's incredibly effective at silencing a Trumper. I think I've blown a few minds - I've literally had them remind me that I'm not being very woke.  Anything that makes them uncomfortable is what we should be doing.  They think there are lines we won't cross - it scares them when they see us use language we aren't supposed to be  using.",jakktrent,2025-04-22T09:12:27,1
"That is not where the pejorative “snowflake” was derived. That is also not the origin of the word snowflake as not a pejorative.   You have a very strange take on this, and are dedicated to convincing others of it. I have to ask myself why. Why invent this concept that the pejorative is derived from the holocaust?  What do you stand to gain, here?",DelightfulAbsurdity,2025-04-23T08:00:21,1
"You just gave me a self aware moment, lol.  I want the left to stop playing nice and act like the crazies, but I guess I draw the line at using the word snowflakes. LOL  (plus, I am sick of winter at this point. Many people in my state will be triggered right now at any mention of the word, ""Snow"") edited to add",Individual-Guest-123,2025-04-22T08:49:59,3
"Not very original thought behind co opting its use.  ""I know you are but what am I?""   I keep trying to log off and keep getting feedback about snowflakes. All the other crap going on right now, and my supposedly fellow libs feel compelled to defend the use of an insult. Good Lord. I make a dozen comments a day on reddit and THIS is the one to blow up?",Individual-Guest-123,2025-04-22T09:08:42,1
"Well we still have free speech at the moment, use whatever word you want.",Individual-Guest-123,2025-04-22T08:56:18,1
"Firstly, if you insist on mimicking MAGA speak, go right ahead.  Secondly, I had read that about the term snowflakes and it stuck with me, although there is such persistence in debunking the NAZI speak connotations I have to ask myself, ""Why?""   Why keep using it if there is any question as to the origin of its use as a derogatory term? And yes, Holocaust survivors have said the the incinerator ashes ""fell like snowflakes"". Oh, you didn't mean it THAT way? Well, I get a little sick every time I see some ignoramus use the word, thinking of the crimes against humanity.  And honestly, it was a cold wet morning after a miserable ass winter, and if you had gone to my State sub and merely typed the word ""snowflakes"" the sub would have exploded.   Again I have to wonder why people would WANT to use MAGA speak, but for now we still have the first amendment, I think, haven't checked my news page yet today.   I would like to see all of you defend the use of other inappropriate slang words.",Individual-Guest-123,2025-04-24T07:12:07,1
"Winter is my favorite season, love getting to think about it every time that word pops up. But yes, we have to stoop to their level, but with morals. Use their own language against them.",JohnJohn173,2025-04-22T09:56:48,1
"Its not that I'm defending use of an insult - it's that I'm intentionally insulting Trumpers at every single turn.  I have found it most effective to speak like them. I went off about Trump being a little bitch beta after that Elmo oval office thing - I had Trumpers go from trying to defend Trump to reminding me that I'm not very woke.  They think they are the only ones that will cross certain lines - it scares them when see us use language like them, bc they are all planning terrible things and they think we will all just roll over.  Over Easter I had to endure a conversation among my the older males in my family where they discussed how there's more people in cities but they don't have guns.  This is serious. We ought to be insulting them. There is no more decency, we need to win, at all costs.",jakktrent,2025-04-22T09:21:31,1
I haven’t yet defended use of the term.  And youre clearly trolling.   So tiring.,DelightfulAbsurdity,2025-04-24T07:20:16,2
