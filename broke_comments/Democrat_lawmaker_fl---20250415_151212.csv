"Probably didn't mean to say it out loud like that, but of course. And I hope when Biden was president that Republicans did the same. That's how things work.",cathbadh,2025-04-15T17:35:03,32
"I'm surprised that this democrat said the quiet part out loud:  .  ""Every single week we have a litigation working group where a large group of us, and I'm talking there's maybe 75 members of the House, sit down every single week with the [attorneys general] to talk about legal strategy,"" Friedman said. ""This is all going on every single week behind the scenes. It is nonstop.""  .  ""Friedman finally confirmed that Democrats are in fact coordinating behind closed doors to weaponize the justice system against their political opponents. """,Ironman650,2025-04-15T15:13:46,16

They do not care if itâ€™s good policy or bad policy. They just want to oppose and stop anything the opposition is trying to do.,swanspank,2025-04-15T19:45:48,2
"Your mistake is thinking Republican's do anything when the Democrats are in control. Congress is a geriatric retirement center that gets so little done I sometimes forget they're even there.  But more importantly, when Republican's have control they do next to nothing at all to push the administrations agenda, while when Democrat's have control they get rank and file and push through as much of their socialist garbage as possible.  I'd laugh if it wasn't infuriating how limp-dicked Republican's have become. I mean ffs, people like Musk and Trump are classic Democrats, they're not even Republican in the truest sense, but they're the best we've had to get anything accomplished.",Sangmund_Froid,2025-04-15T23:29:43,4
>I'm surprised that this democrat said the quiet part out loud:  Add in all the NGO's laundering goverment money to fund said working groups.,GiediOne,2025-04-15T16:00:58,5
"The progressive grift machine has made Republicans limp-dicked.  Democrats get to do what they want, and indeed are rewarded for extreme behavior - think book deals, NGO board positions, and TV panelists.  Republicans have to toe the line to remain in on the same grift.  MAGA is excluded.",CallMeCassandra,2025-04-16T09:32:23,2
