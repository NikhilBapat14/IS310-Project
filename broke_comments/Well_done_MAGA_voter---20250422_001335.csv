"I'm convinced at this point that MAGA seriously wants to fuck us all. It's like being on a boat and watching someone make holes while the rest of us work tirelessly to patch them up. Bitch, that's my retirement right there you're fucking with. I never had much faith in Social Security, I've never been too certain there will be anything left when I retire (I'm 33) so I've been trying to invest and save as much as I can. I'm even less confident in Social Security than I ever was before.   If this shit keeps up, I'm never going to retire.  This administration has not convinced anyone of a master plan. If you think he has some kind of master plan, you're simply naive. Worst April since Great Depression?

You are 33 which means you still have decades before you retire. Retirement is a long term game. The stock market goes up and down all the time.   GW Bush tanked the economy. Thousands of people lost their homes. Banks were failing to the point the federal government had to step in.   All of this chaos came from GW Bush lifting protection regulations.   Then Obama became president and one of the first things he did was put regulations in place to prevent banks from using predatory tactics.   Obama turned the economy around during his first term.   My point is don't stress about your retirement. This is a small blip in time. Things will turn around eventually.,crew_you,2025-04-22T12:25:17,4

Without  government employees we have no government,  no society, and no protection. There is no over stating the importance of the jobs you do.   In all my life I'd never heard of this mysterious ""deep State"" until Trump ran for president. So I recently looked it up to see where it came from. This is what I found:  ""During his first presidency, Donald Trump and his strategists alleged that the deep state was interfering with his agenda and that the United States Department of Justice was part of the deep state because it did not prosecute Huma Abedin or James Comey.  Some Trump allies and right-wing media outlets alleged that Obama was coordinating a deep state resistance to Trump.  Trump has used the term ""deep state"" to refer to the U.S. government, in particular government Institutions that ""frustrate"" him, as well as block or fail to implement his government policy such as courts, the Justice Department, and the news media.""  I remember the first time I heard the term ""deep State"" it sounded like some sinister secret society deep within the government that gets together to spread evil around the world.""  In other words, all the ills of society are blamed while doing a thankless jobs v  I just want you to know that you matter, your skills matter, and your dedication to your country matters.",crew_you,2025-04-22T23:35:39,3
"My daughter in law lost her job working for the USDA/Forest Service as a career research scientist. The work they did helped the local population , there are no jobs where she lives for someone with her credentials. She owns a home , she has no idea what she‚Äôs going to do. She will probably have to sell her house and move because of Elon.  They literally had to scrap experiments in progress worth 100‚Äôs of thousands of dollars, she had just received a research grant worth 1.1M, she speaks 5 languages, publishes scientific papers in leading journals and speaks at conferences all over the globe.  Her career has been detonated by someone who has zero understanding of what it is she does.  The trickle down will  ultimately affect local farmers for a very long time to come.  It‚Äôs just unbelievable.  F47 I‚Äôm sorry you are in the same boat. It just plain sucks.  Trump was 1,000% preventable. He should be in a square cell not an Oval Office.  The attorneys general failed us.",ThowAwayTrash,2025-04-23T22:15:33,2

Thank you. We worked hard everyday. We were paid well. We might have been overworked and stressed out at times but we had a good secure life. Now my husband and I need to figure out a way to survive It really did not have to be this way. I thank god I don‚Äôt have kids to take care of. But I know many federal workers that lost their job do have small children. I worry for them and our collective future.,I_like_kittycats,2025-04-23T10:06:49,3
I am so sorry I am in the same position.  We stupidly bought a home 2 years ago. We will lose a lot of money now but we can‚Äôt afford the mortgage payments.  I have to move out of my home state and go somewhere cheaper.  It sucks to see projects stopped and canceled mid stream because we have idiots hell bent on destroying this country. The bots and trolls that cheer this on sicken me. If we didn‚Äôt have cats we would leave the country. I just can‚Äôt put them through that ‚òπÔ∏è I really am sorry about your daughter and I just hope somehow we see our way back to a normally functioning government,I_like_kittycats,2025-04-23T22:21:07,2
"As I, a relocated Yankee in South Florida (which is likely a redundanc), I came upon the term when a younger colleague watched me work, and, upon successfully completing my task, he said to me, ""I'll brag on you."" The young man was from Kentucky or Alabama, so maybe the phrase is regional, nevertheless, I understood it to mean that he would brag about my success on my behalf.  So, let me know if I'm right, after you complete your research project, because that's what I mean...",PersonalClassroom967,2025-04-23T19:10:10,1
