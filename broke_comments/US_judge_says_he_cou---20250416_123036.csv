"ok so from what I get from this, next steps are : 1) the gov. is allowed to ""purge its contemps"", meaning here seriously allowing illegally extrated people to do some judicial action to contest their situation. 2) if the gov. refuses (they will), the court will look for someone in the gov. responsible for the shitshow (miller?) and ask for a declaration to explain themselves (they will just answers bullshits, probably). 3) If the declaration is unsatisfactory to the court, it will hear the plaintiffs and request prosecution of the gov. to be conducted by a gov. attorney (which probably won't because they report to the gov., duh). 4) If the gov. attorney refuses to prosecute their own boss, the court will FINALLY appoint a non-gov. attorney to prosecute.   Sounds like we're still days, if not weeks appart from the serious stuff to start. Meanwhile, trump & co add two or three more crazy bullshits per day to fuck up the economy and consolidate their fascist system, while people keep on decaying in El Salvador concentration camps.",US-Resist-Info,2025-04-17T21:44:38,2
