"I forget he's even running for Governor. Probably wasn't a good idea to ignore the Republican ""advice"" to not do town halls right now. Don't know what he thought would happen, lol.",usernames_suck_ok,2025-04-21T22:57:40,7
Florida still has a good base of people who believe elon is a brilliant person,bobolly,2025-04-22T06:53:35,4
"These chucklefucks get off on this.  They don’t care about optics because their seats are safe.  Donalds knows he’s going to be very favored for governor no matter what as long as he’s a Republican.  He, like others, get off on the power trip of aggravating constituents and those who disagree.  He thinks it makes him look strong.  Like a leader who stands up against the angry mob to do what’s best.  Instead, he’s another fascist who is all too happy to sell out his constituents and state for more power and money for himself.    Him trying to use his race as bait to try and win n argument shows he has no shame.  There was no reason for that, other than to try and obfuscate and play victim, to the applause of his bootlickers.  He knows Trump is happy and that’s all that matters to him.  He’s a piece of shit who has no ideas to actually benefit his constituents.  It’s just insane that these people didn’t see it coming.",teamdiabetes11,2025-04-22T07:25:37,2
