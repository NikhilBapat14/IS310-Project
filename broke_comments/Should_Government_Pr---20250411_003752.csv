"Innovation is going to happen somewhere. It might as well happen here. stephen hawking summed it up pretty well when he postulated that a visit from aliens would probably go as well for us as it did for the native Americans when Columbus came to America. It generally doesn't work out well for the less technologically advanced and less educated. Just look at any nation or culture that discourages education and innovation, and enforces traditional and antiquated, often religious, ideals. Those places are typically 2nd world and 3rd world places, rife with poverty and economic instability. Look no further than the south itself. They receive the most federal aid. They have the highest poverty rates. Higher rates of preventable death and disease. Texas' grid collapses when it gets cold, a very preventable problem if they just would have followed modern infrastructure regulations.

Depends on the innovation. Innovation that is simply having illegal hotels and cabs should be discouraged. Destroying industries simply to pay people as 1099 workers or to ship the job overseas should be discouraged. Innovation that funnels money upwards to leave everyone else to fend for themselves should be discouraged.   Actually having new and better industries is great. Saving the horse and buggy when cars were better would have been foolish. Eliminating jobs to have children and slavers do the same thing for cheaper will erode a countries ability to do anything else.,SuperConfused,2025-04-11T12:57:37,1
"The framing of the question as an either-or proposal feels wrong.  First, let's notice that ""protecting jobs"" and ""shielding industries"" are different things, done in different ways. Industries are not the jobs they create.  Protecting jobs should include providing support for transitioning to a new job in a new industry if some innovation is ripping apart the old industry. For example, coal miners could be given training and job placement assistance in an adjacent industry like gold mining or one of the new industries encroaching on coal, like wind power or carbon capture. The training is there to help those whose experience doesn't necessarily transfer over to the new industry directly.  If we had _good_ programs to help people transition to new industries like this, ""protecting jobs"" and ""innovation"" would never be conflicting goals. And they shouldn't be! A program like that is basically unemployment benefits with extra steps.",Delta-9-,2025-04-11T14:09:47,1
"Maybe not historically, but now it absolutely should. In all previous revolutions, humans were able to move to the new areas that increased economic dynamism unlocked. This led to net improvements in living standards even if it disrupted certain sectors.   Now, any new areas that are unlocked by AI can be filled with AI. This will remove the need for labor, which is the only asset one has unless they already own sufficient capital to live off their assets. For the vast majority of humans, this is not the case.   What happens when we innovate our species out of economic relevance? Do we say “well at least the innovation continues.” And, at least in the US, the idea that we’d socialize AI means of production for some post labor utopia is a pipe dream.",fellow-fellow,2025-04-12T08:03:25,1

"""Innovation"" is code for ""downsizing staff and investing in more/advanced automation"" in most cases. And it is entirely to do with cutting costs over time and avoiding the various legal risks associated with employment.   It's also only something that the owners and managers of capital have any say in to begin with. They aren't asking their employees permission to ""innovate"" or rather ""downsize and automate."" They are just doing it and throwing their employees off, usually with minimal or no safety net. That's the ideal scenario being sought out, and the primary cause for it is realizing more profits for the owners of capital over time.  And since employment is more or less the only ticket someone has to a stable life with necessary medical benefits and access to housing in our societies, it's imperative that some agency or organization either steps in to facilitate new employment elsewhere or compel corporations to extend benefits for a reasonable amount of time that the former employee may do so themselves.   Otherwise the so called ""innovation"" is nothing more than a decentralized command that certain people must abandon building their lives and instead eliminate themselves from society. There has to be employment continuity between the rise and fall of various industries, or else it's nothing more than population control.",Gruzman,2025-04-11T01:26:09,0
"This isn't even the frame government should be operating in. Government should, in my view, help create the necessary conditions for people to live good lives. Many forms of innovation may contribute to that goal, even while having some negative impacts on e.g. employment. Other innovations just cause more harm than good if left to their own devices.   It's a case by case - protecting coal while clean energy saves lives and produces more jobs is obviously dumb (though coal workers should receive plenty support in transitioning to other gigs). But I think regulation forcing rights payments for AI training data would've been good, both out of a decency principle, and because I think people working in art is good for a society.

"Neither of these things are imperatives for governance. A job is an instrumental good to the extent that the broader political economic context requires that people have them to make enough money to live freely. Governments should protect people irrespective of their employability, their ""work ethic"", or any other supposed metric of ""merit"" or usefulness in the ""job market"".  Likewise ""innovation"" is largely a buzzword, and at best its value is and should be relegated to *instrumentality* subservient to human needs.   These concepts in the context of governance are yet another aspect of the wholly reductive and inhumane nature of capitalism.

"The government should not be preserving jobs per se; it should be assuring that vital resources and products can be supplied domestically.  If the USA loses the ability to make children’s toys and must import them from China, no big deal.  If the USA has to import rare earth minerals or steel from China, that’s a big deal.

"https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/s/pD61iTT7zW  So all of this is nothing, eh?   All you've got on offer is a nihilistic fatalism that the only thing Appalachia can hope for is to be abandoned once the bottom finally drops out of the coal industry and their capitalist overlords take their money and leave. That's not respecting miners, that's not helping them, that's just intellectual laziness to justify not having to do anything. Solving a problem is hard work, and requires everyone to accept that the world can't stay the same forever. And it requires *everyone* to be working towards solving it: to blame the federal Democrats for not having solved the problem is to ignore the complicency of the federal and state Republicans and local government in doing nothing to prepare for the future. What's Trump or Morrissey's plan for when the world stops using coal? Even with the most polluting friendly laws in the US you could imagine, the economics mean that coal will *still* be replaced by natural gas as the main fossil fuel in power plants, and eventually it's going to be replaced by hydrogen for steel production too. The world will move on, and Republicans need a better solution than 'leave for states that *are* still mining'.",VodkaBeatsCube,2025-04-11T09:26:57,3

">To the extent that there's a problem with the Democratic solution, it's in not spending fast and soon enough.  Close enough to admitting what I asked!  Yes, this is precisely the problem with the Democratic solution.  By the time any of these investments bear fruit, it will be far too late for the region.  They're offering the decline of coal now and an unspecific, non-working alternative sometime in the future.  Real solutions need to replace what has been lost with the decline of the coal industry.  A great place to start would be healthcare.  It's an embarrassment that we're the only developed nation without any system of universal healthcare.  This is a solvable problem, and would directly address the loss of healthcare that accompanies the loss of jobs.  Tax revenue from coal industries must also be replaced.  That's what keeps roads paved, schools open, and parks running.  Democrats could commit to federal investments that match any lost revenue from the coal industry.  Adequate public housing is part of the solution.  One obstacle here is that no one can move away even if they want to because no one wants to buy their property.  Federal land buybacks and affordable housing alternatives would directly address these problems.  Existing coal infrastructure and many jobs can be saved by repurposing it.  The same regions that produce coal are ideal for producing hemp as a biofuel, it's one of few biofuel crops that thrive in mountainous regions.  The same trains that carry coal can carry biofuel, which can be burned in coal fired plants instead of shutting them down.  Wouldn't even require significant investment, you can just switch fuels with minimal modification.  Federal cannabis policy is one obstacle to this, lack of investment and subsidy is another.  I can keep going, but I'll give you an opportunity to respond to what I've said so far.  Bernie Sanders, who was far more popular in coal country than the other democrats who all failed miserably, offered these things and earned votes for it, so don't bother saying the people don't want this.

Free healthcare, government subsidies for infrastructure and even buying out their houses won't give them gainful employment. If you don't have a replacement for the coal industry, then the unspoken point of the argument is that they should just move. Which aside from not being a viable solution, is *far* more insulting than telling them to learn a new skill.  And hemp farming and biofuel refining is an entirely new industry: you aren't going to just feed hemp into the top of a coal washer and get biofuel out of it. Farming and refining are not hard rock or even open pit mining, which should be self evident. You're going to need to build the farms, which is relatively light construction, and then build the digesters and infrastructure to make the biofuel, which is not if you're planning on doing it at a scale to make multiple billions of dollars a year. And even if you can keep some coal plants ticking over by converting them to biofuel, they're aging infrastructure: the US hasn't built one in more than a decade, and the average age of an operational plant is 45 years. The average age of a plant on shutdown? 50 years. Even if you retrofit them, they're going to age out just from how long it's been since most of them were built. And they're going to continue to be replaced with a mixture of natural gas, renewables and potentially small modular nuclear reactors.   I'll give you credit for actually trying to find *something* as an alternative.

The *best* case scenario you can expect is to have to build an entire new agricultural to refining infrastructure in Appalachia, and then you'd still have to build the biofuel plant infrastructure pretty soon down the line too given how old most of the coal plants you hope to retrofit are. if you're going to do all that retraining and development *anyway*, you should at least try and properly industrialize rather than just move from one natural resources trap to another and have to deal with the collapse of the *biofuel* industry in 40 years once we have fusion plants and we all drive electric cars.",VodkaBeatsCube,2025-04-11T13:07:18,1
"Look, you can believe whatever you want. You're far from the most whack-a-doodle person on Reddit, and they're all allowed to post too. But if you honestly think you've made a solid argument for why your position is both different and better than the standard Democratic one, you're in for disappointment.",VodkaBeatsCube,2025-04-11T13:20:13,1
">But if you honestly think you've made a solid argument for why your position is both different and better than the standard Democratic one, you're in for disappointment.  So you think they'd be better off without universal healthcare?  You really talked yourself into a corner here.",sllewgh,2025-04-11T13:23:49,1
"How many times to I have to repeat the same point before you actually understand it? Yes, they will be better off with universal healthcare. It's a good policy I support. Even with universal healthcare, you will still need to do something about the inevitable collapse of the coal industry. The only relevance universal healthcare has to the discussion is that it would provide more time to address the economic collapse the end of the coal industry will cause, and make it easier for people to move out of West Virgina. Neither are actual solutions to the problem.   So, *once again*, we land back at your hemp idea being the first thing to actually potentially solve the problem of the end of coal mining. And I frankly don't think it's a very good plan. On its own merits, it's just moving from one resource trap to another and thus spending money to only delay the problem. Better to actually be a little ambious and try and build something with longer term viability. And, as I've pointed out more than once, it's just another form of retraining and economic diversification which is what I've been arguing for from the hop as the solution.",VodkaBeatsCube,2025-04-11T13:32:12,2
">Yes, they will be better off with universal healthcare.  Ok, so my plan IS superior to the democrats.",sllewgh,2025-04-11T13:44:16,1
"Not for the specific question were talking about it isn't. You support good social programs, great, do you want a cookie? That's not what we're talking about here, and they won't *solve* the problem of the collapse of the coal industry.",VodkaBeatsCube,2025-04-11T13:46:51,2
">That's not what we're talking about here, and they won't solve the problem.  Can you explain how universal healthcare would NOT solve the problem of folks losing access to healthcare when they lose their jobs?  Or do you not consider that a problem?",sllewgh,2025-04-11T13:48:23,1
"I have a hard time believing you actually don't understand this. Losing healthcare is a problem, just not the one we're talking about. With or without universal healthcare, people will still need jobs. Universal healthcare will not replace the coal industry, at best it slows down the collapse and gives people space to leave. Neither of those actually replace the key industry in the Appalachian economy. So it's largely irrelevant to the discussion. Polar bear conservation is also a good policy, but being good policy doesn't make it *relevant* policy.",VodkaBeatsCube,2025-04-11T13:53:48,2
">Losing healthcare is a problem, just not the one we're talking about.  It's not the problem YOU'RE talking about. You moved the goal posts. It's definitely one of the problems *I've* been talking about.  You asked for solutions, I gave them, now you think we're talking about a different problem.",sllewgh,2025-04-11T13:54:42,1
"Yes, I've been pointing out you're talking about an irrelevant point ever since you first brought it up. We were talking about how to deal with the collapse of the coal industry in Appalachia, and when I finally got you to actually try and codify what you thought would solve the problem the first thing you brought up are enhanced social programs that will not actually replace the coal industry as the economic core of their economy. We could impliment every single one of your favoured social programs, and while they would improve people's lives, they would not stop the economic collapse that the end of coal mining would bring. They can't, it's not what they're designed to do. Even if we went as far as completely buying into your proposal to entirely backstop any tax shortfalls, you *still* would have the local fallout of people not having jobs. It doesn't matter if the roads still get paved if most people's only choices to make a living are going on welfare or moving to another state.",VodkaBeatsCube,2025-04-11T14:03:15,2
"If you lose your job, you lose your health care. That is a problem. Universal healthcare is one way to solve that problem, replacing the jobs is another.  I'm down to listen to your redevelopment plans. In the meantime, only I have proposed any solutions to any problems related to job loss.   The democrats sure don't have the answers. I'll remind you that you already acknowledged that in this conversation.  There's a reason I waited to give my solutions until you admitted that fact.",sllewgh,2025-04-11T14:08:17,1
"I admitted nothing. You took a qualified point as a win in order to stoke your ego.  I've been proposing industrial development as a solution well before you came up with your hemp idea, and another user posted details of the actual Democratic proposals to spend more than a quarter of a billion dollars on economic development. The core of the Democratic proposals are economic development and retraining, which is exactly what your hemp plan is. To the extent you have an actionable disagreement, it's one of details not method.  And universal healthcare will solve the healthcare problem. It will not solve the job problem, which is what we're *actually* talking about no matter how hard you try and deflect into general social policies.",VodkaBeatsCube,2025-04-11T14:17:20,2
"You wanna rehash this?   >another user posted details of the actual Democratic proposals to spend more than a quarter of a billion dollars on economic development.  You didn't have a direct response to my point that this is nothing compared to the scope of the problem. You chose not to rebut the fact that this is too little, too slow, but did go on to acknowledge that I'd made that point.  >And universal healthcare will solve the healthcare problem. It will not solve the job problem  One of the ""job problems"" is the loss of healthcare that accompanies the loss of jobs. Do you disagree?",sllewgh,2025-04-11T14:22:53,1
"You haven't really offered anything with a greater scope. And even if we assume your vague proposal to 'grow hemp, make biofuel and keep using the coal plants' is, in fact, a multi-billion dollar endevour, it's *still* the same sort of policy. Just on what I have to take your word to be an expanded scope. You don't actually have a problem with retraining as you articulated [way down here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1jwimdl/should_government_protect_jobs_over_innovation/mmjt472/), you just want it done your way.  And loss of healthcare is a consequence of losing your job for most Americans, but it is still secondary to the actual problem we're discussing. If West Virgina was a Canadian province and everyone had federally guaranteed Medicaid, the collapse of the coal industry would still be an existential threat to the economy and people's livelihoods. As I've said multiple times, universal healthcare does not solve the problem, the best it does is give you more time to deal with the collapse. Since the industry hasn't actually collapsed yet, it's not actually relevant to the discussion at this point.",VodkaBeatsCube,2025-04-11T14:35:00,2
