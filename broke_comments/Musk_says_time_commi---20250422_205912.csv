" A DOGE staffer created government system accounts for Russian users, who then attempted to access the sensitive system more than 20 times within 15 minutes of the account being created. The only reason they couldn’t access it was because of network policies that prevent out-of-country access.  https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/government-it-whistleblower-calls-out-doge-says-he-was-threatened-at-home/  Eventually though, the Russian was able to log in, and then the DOGE staffer deleted all logs  https://www.npr.org/2025/04/15/nx-s1-5355896/doge-nlrb-elon-musk-spacex-security",Threeseriesforthewin,2025-04-22T21:11:12,11

I don’t have so much hate for Tesla. I simply dislike the look of Musk in the government. There are still good people working for Tesla so I don’t necessarily want their business to crumble. I actually think it’s great that he’s moving away from the White House a little. ,Partimenerd,2025-04-23T00:26:07,3

"Tesla would be fine if Musk resigned, but that's not going to happen any time soon.  So him 'stepping back' from Government meddling (which apparently he's still going to do 1-2 days a week) and going back to Tesla doesn't fix the issue here.  He's the problem.  He doesn't just get to fuck with everything and then people are mean to him, go back to what he was doing before and hopes it all goes away.",metalkhaos,2025-04-23T09:10:55,1
