"She's a civilian with no official business there and she just hangs out???  How would it look if the soldiers, security analysts and intel people that work there also just brought their spouses to work all the time. Real professional.  It says she is applying for a security clearance. I am real curious what the justification because they don't just accept applications from anybody for no reason. (It's probably to try to cover their asses when it comes out that she's seen other classified stuff).",Bruce-7891,2025-04-23T15:06:34,44

"She's in charge of the new Pentagon makeup application room for officials doing press releases.   ""The suggestion for improving the space came from Tami Radabaugh, the deputy assistant to the secretary for strategic engagement and a former producer for Fox News and for CBS News, according to multiple sources. The chief Pentagon spokesman, Sean Parnell, and the defense secretary's wife, Jennifer Hegseth, also a former Fox producer, expressed their approval for the upgrade before it was undertaken, one of the sources said. """,MLJ9999,2025-04-23T15:14:08,10
