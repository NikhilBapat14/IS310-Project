"The Trump administration has dropped, paused, or withdrawn federal enforcement cases against at least 17 corporations that donated to Trump’s inaugural fund, totaling about $50 million in donations.  Bank of America, Capital One, Coinbase, DuPont, and JPMorgan had federal cases dismissed after their donations.  Google benefited from the Justice Department dropping part of an antitrust breakup plan, and Coinbase saw a major SEC lawsuit dismissed after donating $1 million.  Apple donated $1 million and received tariff exemptions; Intuit donated and then benefited from the IRS ending its free tax filing program.  The administration has halted or dropped enforcement actions against over 100 corporations in its first months, with a notable concentration among major donors  Public Citizen and others argue this represents a clear case of “pay-to-play” corruption, where corporate donations appear to buy favorable treatment from the administration.",Many_Trifle7780,2025-04-22T18:55:32,8

"> Every Trump action is to weaken America.  Every Trump action is to benefit Trump. This includes both collaborating with Russia and collaborating with the rest of Trump's capitalist class - and those two go hand in hand, because capital always pushes for undermining the rights of the working class and destroy all attempts at left-wing organizing, which also happens to benefit Russian oligarchs.  Stop humping the flag, this blind nationalism is how you reach fascist demagogues like Trump. When you follow that track you end up succumbing to the next fascist who touts ""America First!"" and continues to grind the working class into the dirt (domestically and globally) just because 'well this one isn't Russian!'.",sajberhippien,2025-04-23T09:20:39,-1
