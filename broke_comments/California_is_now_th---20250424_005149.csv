"All the way back in 2015 then Governor of Cali. Jerry Brown signed *SB 350* intending to increase renewable electricity use to 50% and double energy efficiency in existing buildings by 2030.  California met their renewable energy target *years* ahead of schedule with 52.7% of electricity on the grid being produced from renewable sources in 2017.   And last year the Californian grid ran on 100% renewables with no blackouts or cost rises [for 98 days](https://electrek.co/2024/12/31/california-grid-100-percent-renewables-no-blackouts-cost-rises/).  Republicans in the state legislature opposed the bill at the time citing the usual talking points. They said it would cost too much, harm the economy, and was government overreach.   The oil lobby also [spent heavily on public relations campaigns](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/05/how-big-oil-spent-millions-to-defeat-california-climate-change-legislation-sb-350) arguing it would harm the economy, raise gas prices, and restrict consumer choice.  Of course none of that happened -- it was never going to happen.

"That’s great news, and also as a native Californian who left I will say they absolutely do have major issues. Not because it’s a shithole, or it is unlivable as our braindead conservatives claim, but because the distribution of wealth in that state is fucking brutal.  I have friends and family in the state that bring in $100k+/year for their household, and don’t enjoy anything near a middle class life.  They work hard (50-65 hours per week) and they have little to show for it other than good weather.  It’s not sustainable, as it is right now.

"Energy in northern California (PG&E) is absurdly expensive and rates keep increasing far beyond inflation. Rates have doubled in 3 years. But it's NOT because of renewable energy. It's largely because of deregulation and privatization of public utilities like has happened almost everywhere else in the country, which is what the GOP always wants. We're not immune in California to Republican rot and the infrastructure here shows it. Deregulation is especially dangerous here because of the nature of the climate and damage capable of a single spark during fire weather here, and the expense of hardening the neglected system is supposedly why rates have increased (although the company still keeps pulling record profits). We have a third world energy system here (I've lived all over the US and in Europe and have never had 1/10th  as many outages as here, where we barely get any weather) and all the other infrastructure is well behind the rest of the developed world.",fertthrowaway,2025-04-24T09:18:17,53

That's not true.  The 98 day span produced more electricity from renewable sources than we used, but the grid did not run on all of it.

The grid needs to run 24 hours a day, not just for 5 hours. We are making a lot of progress with increased supply of batteries but we still burn a lot of natural gas to keep the grid running.

CA even has it's own military department lol (headquarters for the national guard and state guard).  The problem is, the federal government ultimately controls almost all of it.  The one exception (kinda) is the state guard, which is a state militia controlled by the governor only (unlike the National Guard), which pretty much acts as support for the national guard (but many members are also part of the regular military, and can be called away to those units).  It's only 1,000 strong, but the governor is authorized to call up all able-bodied male CA residents between the ages of 18 and 45, in the event of an emergency, which means around...15 million people maybe?    CA also has some great natural barriers to invasion:  an ocean, mountains, and deserts.  CA has lots of relevant natural resources too, including oil fields.

That's leaving aside the complex realities of wealth aggregation/concentration in CA and NY, both internally and with respect to the US as a whole, and the fact that the internal migration of the US population trends *away* from NY and CA and *toward* the Rockies, Eastern Appalachia and Florida, and Texas. *That* an American can migrate across the continent with no impediments (almost always to improve their own station) is part of what has historically driven prosperity, and it's a feature that smaller nations simply don't enjoy.

">PGE enacted 4 rate increases last year and we pay 3x the national average per kW.  But these increases have been largely due to *lack* of regulation that lead to aging infrastructure that needs to be replaced and tens of billions of dollars in liability due to wildfires caused by their negligence.  Another large factor has been people like us who have transitioned off grid with solar.  PG&E still has to provide the infrastructure, but doesn't get any revenue from us.  Although on the plus side, during peak hours, they're getting free (or really cheap) electricity from us.  Sure, early on transitioning to renewables added costs, but these investments are starting to pay off and put downward pressure on rates with new renewable energy production being cheaper.  What's really amazing is seeing how many people are driving EVs now in the state, and at the time we've gone from rolling brown outs being an expected way of life that kept getting worse (2000-2001), to not having one in almost 5 years now.

"Well and the modern globalized world exists largely because the theory of comparative advantage was all but proven by economists more than 200 years ago.  We all grew up in a world that recognized its benefits.   Absolute Advantage is simple and intuitive.  Assume that English domestic production  can produce steel at 100 per ton and wool at 80 per ton.   On the other hand Spain can produce steel at 120 per ton and wool at 60 per ton.   The economies of both countries will be larger and more successful if they have free access to English steel at 100 per ton and Spanish wool at 60 per ton.   What is counterintuitive but mathematically proven by David Ricardo is that even if england could produce both wool and steel more cheaply than Spain,   both countries will still benefit from free trade.  Because producers in England will pick the good that has the higher profit margin and produce more of that for export, and Spain can make up the difference of the goods with the lower profit margin exporting those to england.  Both economies still benefit.   On the other hand tariffs encourage anti-competitive behavior.   If I make a good in America and my cost is $100 and my competition from China's cost is $60 but tariffs raise the price to $110, I have no incentive to make my cost more cheaply, and in fact I can actually raise the price to $109 and still be guaranteed to be cheaper than my competitor.",BigBennP,2025-04-24T06:35:23,32
"Another major complication is the fact that tariffs were put on goods that literally cannot be produced domestically in volumes anywhere approaching our demand.

"Tarrifs will also lead to increased prices from domestic producers. First of all because any inputs that they import get more expensive, and secondly because if foreign competitors raise their prices they often can raise then as well. For instance, if a Chinese company sells paperclips in the US for $5 per pound and an American company sells them for $7 per pound, and the Chinese one gets hit with a $3 tarrif, the American paperclips are suddenly cheaper. But if they increase their price to $7.75 per pound, they are *still* cheaper but now make a lot more money per pound sold.",MarkZist,2025-04-24T08:39:02,2
"European and American, including California, have very different regulations by means of what the intent behind regulation is. European regulations tend to inform customers of possible risk while American regulations typically limit liability. It was explained to me as you go to the ocean. America says ""Play in the water but if you're bitten by a shark it's not on me."" Europe says ""Sharks live in the ocean, so be careful""  My job was in chemical regulations. For the most part, between California and Europe, it was similar. California typically mirrors Europe, with a little lag time. The biggest thing is Cal Prop 65, which is largely the most misunderstood and useless regulation due to how it's structured- it gives more incentive to companies to label everything as hazardous with little to no downside to labelling but lots of potential hazards if you don't.

There has been no reference to 'overriding the borders' or violating 'federal approval' in Newsom's press release or this thread.

If you read the link, you will understand that Newsom is seeking ""agreements"" with California's largest trading partners, and relief from retaliatory tariffs that might be imposed on US exports.    Retaliatory tariffs impact products imported TO California, and can be offset by private trade concessions.  Obviously the State of California is in a position to reciprocate by offering trade concessions on products exported FROM California.  Trade agreements can apply to anything - from a general dollar figure or a ratio, down to aggregate or specific price discounts.  There is nothing illegal about that.

I think this is readily demonstrated by the price of goods from china in the US over the last several decades. You can buy an American-made hammer for $50,  or you can go to Home Depot and buy a roughly comparable chinese-made hammer for $35, a crappier Chinese hammer for $12 or you can go to Harbor Freight and buy a really cheap chinese-made hammer for $6.99.    A 200% tariff means the price of the $6.99 Hammer is now $21 The mid grade Hammer is now $36 and the nice Hammer is now $105. You still have the American Hammer being sold at 50.    If you are in charge of the factory making American-made hammers what do you do with your prices?",BigBennP,2025-04-24T07:14:27,13
"Because other people in Spain would invest in a new steel mill and produce steel at the cheaper price.   And if all the steel mills in Spain raised the prices, that’s the problem with monopolies and why the government would step in to break it.",practicalm,2025-04-24T07:03:08,9
The first part of the example doesn’t discuss prices but costs. Spain can make wool for less cost than England. Prices will be about the same but Spain will produce the majority of wool and England will make up the difference (assuming demand exceeds Spain’s production capacity).,mmsyppkv,2025-04-24T07:00:27,3
"This is a bit of both, yes they have corn syrup(specifically corn syrup solids, glucose based) in them but not the corn syrup(high fructose corn syrup) people don't want.  There is no high fructose corn syrup in baby formula in the US(because fructose is really bad for babies), thats a lie told by RFK and the right. But plenty of glucose syrups(corn syrup solids) made from corn would be allowed. The person you are responding to definitely thinks they are putting high fructose corn syrup in baby formula though which is not done by any brand of baby formula in the US.  I think this is a good example of how easy it is to spread misinformation with a bit of oomission to the masses, if you tell them to go look for corn syrup but leave out that corn syrup solids aren't the same as the high fructose syrup people rally against then it looks like all the formulas are killing our babies, and the majority aren't going to look past the surface level detail.

"You can do that if you wish, and the incentive to do so under the current circumstances is what has people worried that in 6 months we’re all gonna get screwed raw by runaway inflation. A tariffs is meant to be applied selectively, to induce a particular kind of spending behavior: foreign is now more expensive than domestic, whereas before foreign was cheaper.  The hope is that you will now now buy domestic. But the now cheaper domestic is still more expensive than what you were previously paying for the foreign. So the further hope is that, while you may bristle at the higher price, your desire for the good will outweigh the higher financial burden: you just need to adjust your budget a teeny bit to keep getting the thing you want.  But what if you repeat that process *for everything?* If tariffs are placed on every single foreign good, then the only alternative is to spend more on the domestically produced [insert 80% of the things you buy in a year here]. So your cost of living just increased by a fuck-ton, and while you and all your neighbors still have enough money to buy, prices will not drop. Not until nobody has the money to buy anything. And since taxing the rich and raising wages is and will always be non-starter for every conservative, there won’t be any coming back from it.

"It's not necessarily that the market in the United States is inherently less competitive, it's that the tariffs themselves make it less competitive by eliminating big chunks of the competition.   American manufacturers cannot compete with a Chinese manufacturer on price. Labor costs are lower, environmental regulations might be more lenient etc. So American manufacturers work on carving out their market share by focusing on quality and branding, primarily for the professional Market.    Previously, American manufacturers knew that if they raised prices too much, some percentage of their customer base would decide the slightly less quality Chinese equivalent was a better deal even if they had to replace it. Now the price pressure from the Chinese competition is out of the picture and their competition is only the American manufacturers.   But the American manufacturers have most of the same constraints in terms of manufacturing costs so there's a higher price floor.    So someone like estwing could possibly realize that the price pressure from their $35 Chinese competitor is gone. So they can raise the price of their hammers from 50 to 60 without losing a significant number of sales.  Maybe American Tool could jump in and market a $50 Hammer instead but the question is whether they constitute a credible threat to the sales.    There are both employees and Business Consultants whose entire job is basically to build giant spreadsheets and do business analytics to try to answer these questions for companies.",BigBennP,2025-04-24T08:51:03,2
