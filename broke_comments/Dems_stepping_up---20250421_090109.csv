Where are the rest of them? ALL Democrats in both the Senate and the House need to stand up and demand his resignation.,Obi1NotWan,2025-04-21T11:48:58,10

Call for it? Can they actually treat it like the national security threat it is,amievenrelevant,2025-04-21T09:29:13,20
Every senator and representative with any concern for national security and the effectiveness of our military should be calling for his removal.,robcwag,2025-04-21T13:09:35,5
It's gross that every single one of them isn't pushing for it.   Put the pressure to the Republicans. Offer them whatever they want. The GOP knows money. I'm sure some will sway for the correct amount of campaign support.,jokersvoid,2025-04-21T09:23:29,10
So block all legislative activity until he resigns. Some things are worth stopping everything for.,Aramedlig,2025-04-21T12:37:59,4

"Trump really, really, really needs to go. We can't wait until the midterms at this point.   Johnson needs to grow some balls and start impeachment or a forced resignation.

I'm just confused why he keeps doing this. They have to have alternatives,Rosebunse,2025-04-21T11:23:30,2
"I'm willing to bet that there's A LOT of GOP even, that are enraged with Kegstand's security blunders lately, and want him gone, but are too chicken shit to speak out against the MAGAt regime",LivingIndependence,2025-04-21T15:36:01,2

Nice.   Are there any Republicans who care about national security and the safety of our military? Anyone? Anyone at all?,AccomplishedHunt6757,2025-04-22T04:36:49,2

"The problem is ""Dems"" follow the law and due process, Reps just flat out ignore all of that and just do what they want, like criminals. It takes a little longer to follow the processes than to just skip to the end. If you just skip to the end things can go, horribly, horribly, fuckin wrong.",VikingRaptor2,2025-04-21T13:09:34,13
It's always election season. Democrats act tired until 6 months out from a big election. We need to be rabid 24x7x365 until we can be civil again.,VentilatedEgg,2025-04-21T12:08:49,9

"I don't disagree with you but what I'm saying is that there's never a coordinated response to trumpiverse insanity and Dems rely on a fragmented, traditional process that is meaningless to trumpiverse. There's no rapid response messaging nor acknowledgement  that traditional oversight and rules do not apply anymore. I'm not providing specifc actions cause that's not my job but sure would be nice if Dem leadership came up with something, anything that doesn't rely on ""norms.""",Fartron69,2025-04-22T09:32:48,1
"People have. Improve what the DNC holds. Improve the DNC at the state and local level. Improve DNC cities which are a laughing stock.   The DNC has no leg to stand on to be attacking anyone.

Thereâ€™s one Republican representative that just called for him to resign.  Don Bacon from Nebraska,HereWeGo5566,2025-04-21T14:44:40,3
"This rhetoric that the DNC is doing all they can is why they lost. There is so much more they can be doing to ensure they get a majority in the 2026 election other then ""calls"".   They could be working to significantly improve what they have, the states and cities that they control, so they have a foundation to attack from. As it stands right now, the electorate wants *none* of what the DNC is selling. Just because Trump is going to be bad, doesn't mean people will flock to the DNC after this. The only thing that'll happen, is voters will get more apathetic (like the millions of voters who didn't even bother to show up because they were so defeated), which only helps the GOP.",Naticbee,2025-04-21T15:46:53,3
"I understand where youâ€™re coming from but you also gotta consider that Americans are generally short-minded and also, in a bubble. I personally donâ€™t see a point of creating ads until the election. Itâ€™s wasted money. And all that will do is annoy people. Most do not care until something negative happens directly to them. Letâ€™s be real here.",Texas_sucks15,2025-04-21T12:14:01,1

"> there's never a coordinated response to trumpiverse insanity  Almost like it's not a single entity but rather a collection of people with different opinions.  Would it have been better if Schumer silenced AOC for having different ideas?  Or is your idea of ""coordinated response"" to mean ""respond in only the way that I want and anyone with different views should just capitulate""?  > sure would be nice if Dem leadership came up with something,  They keep saying, with no specifics. ""That's not my my job"" is an awfully convenient way to avoid confronting the fact that there really isn't anything Democratic leadership can do.",akcrono,2025-04-22T13:09:40,2
"> People have. Improve what the DNC holds. Improve the DNC at the state and local level. Improve DNC cities which are a laughing stock.  ""Improve the DNC"" is vague to the point of uselessness.

"Short minded yes. But they can also recognize a constant barrage. That's how people get ""tired of.."" The way Dems have done it for so long is wait and say ""remember when?""

"Disagree.  Republicans kept up a constant barrage of right wing media attacks throughout Clinton, Obama and Bidenâ€™s presidencies. Thatâ€™s how they built their base.  You donâ€™t build a base just at election time",Competitive_Ad291,2025-04-22T06:48:48,1
