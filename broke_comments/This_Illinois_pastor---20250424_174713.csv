"I’m pretty sure he was well documented. Between heavenly messengers announcing his arrival, the wise men traveling to see him, and the fact that they were in Bethlehem to pay taxes as citizens, I’m not sure where this fruitcake is coming from.",dottedoctet,2025-04-24T20:01:59,15
This is the faction of the Methodist church us conservative members were more than happy to part with. Go your own way blasphemers.,social_dinosaur,2025-04-24T18:31:22,20
">If Jesus came today in flesh and blood, would we even let him in? Would we let him cross our borders?   Uh oh... Somebody's been watching too many ""He Gets Us"" commercials.",Farmwife64,2025-04-24T18:57:04,20
"Yeshua is not undocumented. The Illinois pastor is using his imagination!  Matthew 17:25-26  And he said to them, “Yes.” And when Kaypha entered the house, Yeshua anticipated him and he said to him, “How does it seem to you Shimeon? From whom do the Kings of the earth take taxes and head money? From their children or from strangers?”  And Shimeon said to him, “From strangers.” Then Yeshua said to him, “Then the children are free.”",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-24T17:50:20,11
Let's accept this pastor's absurdism for a moment - In which book did the State offer acceptance and house an illegal immigrant instead of a private landholder who gave out his stable for them to use?,deciduousredcoat,2025-04-24T18:23:40,3
"I stopped attending organized religion specifically Catholic ones when they took up a second collection to pave the parking lot in the late 80s.  It's a business guys.  A tax free one.  They will pander like olstesn to get Grandmas cash.  It is FREE to believe in whatever you see or helps you from jumping into a bath with a toaster, remember that.",scram007-3,2025-04-24T18:48:19,2

"How about wife beating or human trafficking? Not only this, Yeshua was not undocumented!  But Yoseph had come up from Nazareth, a city of Galilee, to Judea to the city of David called Bethlehem, because he was from the house and from the lineage of David,  With Maryam his bride when she was pregnant, that he might be registered there.  Luke 2:4-5   Yeshua was not undocumented!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-24T18:11:00,48
"A common tactic of the left is to imagine what Jesus they need to make an argument against others, even though they don't believe in Jesus.",QuietRedditorATX,2025-04-24T23:47:13,1

Sounds like 'Palestinians' are illegally in Israeli land.,QuietRedditorATX,2025-04-24T23:48:12,1
"Isn't that the kicker? They all were in Bethlehem, precisely for the census. Can't get any more documented than being born during the census",sowellpatrol,2025-04-24T22:40:07,1
