"Yes. Had Harris won Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania each by very small margins in 2024 she would have done just that. In 2004 John Kerry only would've needed Ohio to do it. While the EC was biased against Democrats from 2016/2020 due to strong margins in big blue states (NY, CA) and close margins in big red states (TX, FL) that was never set in stone and it flipped around in 2024.",kalam4z00,2025-04-05T21:50:51,10
"Yes.  It was entirely plausible as recently as 2004 (Kerry could've pulled it off an Electoral College win over the popular vote winning Bush had he swung Ohio) and 2012 (Romney after the first debate could've won the popular vote, yet still lost to Obama had Florida held blue), when Democrats possessed an Electoral College efficiency advantage (due in a large part to its strength back then with working-class voters).  To add, Hillary was such a smug, arrogant, hubristically prideful dunderhead, both strategically and tactically, that the 2016 Electoral College inefficiency of hers wasn't the norm, but rather an embarrassing anomaly.",NoExcuses1984,2025-04-06T15:55:46,5
They almost did this year oddly enough about 250k votes flip in 3 states and that's enough despite losing the popular vote still by about a million. The EC bias flips back and forth a lot one of the larger ones besides 2020 was 2012 and that was in Obama's favor. Romney basically couldn't win that election he would have needed a PV margin over 3. I'm hoping it happens soon honestly if politics remotely returns to normal it will bet the only thing that will start change.,kmrblue1027,2025-04-05T17:18:49,3
"Of course they could.  At the moment, it's unlikely because of how the swing states look, but nothing is permanent.  If Purple/Blue Texas ever came to fruition it would become much more likely.",ClockOfTheLongNow,2025-04-05T12:14:52,2
"The republicans hate campaign on her for twenty years didn’t do any favors, but calling them a basket of déplorables was the nicest thing she could have said. Where was she for the last three months of the campaign!",klaaptrap,2025-04-07T16:58:45,2
