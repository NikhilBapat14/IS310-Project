"The GOP just has the one move, perpetual permanent tax cuts for the rich. Sometimes they couple it with temporary tax cuts for the middle class that expire once they are out of office but pretty much the only way the GOP helps any working Americans material situation in any way is by temporary tax cuts (which are immediately offset by their cuts to services, rights, and benefits)",Containerstorejams,2025-04-23T22:15:17,22

"4.5 trillion tax break is expensive. They are cutting SNAP, Medicaid, government departments and can't find the money, so Trump tries tariffs, but that's going to destroy small businesses and price out buyers. Politicians need to admit this just isn't feasible. The wealthiest people are not the ones that need more money, because they are not homeless, going hungry, or unable to get medicine.",a_little_hazel_nuts,2025-04-23T22:34:28,15

I'll be surprised if they can even get through the next round of budget stuff without a government shutdown. ,KokonutMonkey,2025-04-23T22:59:25,2

Who cares. This admin is a fucking joke. They probably meant “a wealth of increase of taxes for hikers”,animalslover4569,2025-04-23T23:03:58,1
"Trump said more than once that tax hikes for the affluent can't be done because the GOP is ""traditionally"" the party against tax hikes. That's an excuse? Tradition is the reason for having to cut the federal budget to the bone and closing down agencies that help the most vulnerable among us? Fuck your tradition!     He also said billionaires will leave the country if they have to pay more taxes. Let them leave then. What do they offer this country? Really, what is the great benefit for America to have blood-sucking grotesquely wealthy people living here? If they start businesses, they do it in foreign countries where the wages are lower. If they have domestic businesses, they outsource their workers whenever possible for the same reason.     There is absolutely no valid reason not to make the richest of the rich pay their fair share of this country's taxes. Absolutely none. How much money do people need? How many lives are worth losing so they can keep every cent they own? I believe there is such a thing as having too much money. I adamantly support a wealth cap as a way of closing the unequal wealth gap. A country as rich as ours should not have working people living in poverty. Each and every job should pay a living wage. If the GOP wants women to stay home having bushels of babies, then for god's sake pay them and contribute to their Social Security. Ask yourself, Republicans, what would your Jesus do?",invalidpassword,2025-04-24T04:48:41,1

But but but. Trickle down economics.    But but but. Philanthropy.   But but but. How can they “save humanity” if we take their money!?      I agree with you.  And Seriously - Think it’s fair to say that extreme wealth creates extreme sickness.,Top-Ad-5245,2025-04-24T05:45:38,7
