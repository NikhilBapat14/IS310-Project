"So is this the Biden crime family I hear so much about?  Which one ran the fraud University?  Or the fraud children's cancer charity?  Can we identify the one who bankrupted a casino by running a money laundering operation out of it?   Jeffery Epstein even said he was - Oh!    Oh wait.  No no no, I've got it mixed  up.  Epstein said he was Trump's best friend.  Sorry, got them mixed up.",brothersand,2025-04-20T18:42:44,15

I know 🥹 Love the fluffy kitty and sweet baby 💙  No weird or stark black outfits (and I'm no preppy. I'm someone who wears black 90% of the time)  They look very appropriate yet relaxed.
