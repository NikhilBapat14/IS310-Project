"It’s not enough to wreck your own country Marco, you have to wreck a small island nation as well? The US uses the full weight of it’s power to starve out and segregate Cuba from the world, so they can point and say, “see, communism doesn’t work.” And they still have longer life expectancy, higher literacy rate, better medical care and educational opportunities.   They’ve been trying this shit since 1959 and it hasn’t worked. It’s petty, pathetic, desperate and a waste of money. Why does the US think its any of our business how another country wants to run itself?",no_kids-and-3_money,2025-04-24T14:49:44,2
"Yup!  We can't tolerate any of that free education through whatever level you choose, including grad school, 100% literacy, and universal access to free healthcare and housing. Obviously I got only a sample in the 2 weeks I was there in February, but I enjoyed and loved everything I saw and everyone I met.  We are missing out on not learning from Cuba.",Revolutionary_Air_40,2025-04-24T14:08:01,8
