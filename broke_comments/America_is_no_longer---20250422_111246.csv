"MAGA killed the goose that lays the golden egg just to prove they can.  It's hard to even imagine a more self-destructive and utterly pointless action than starting a world-wide trade war when everything about the existing system heavily favored American interests.  Whatever arises from the ashes of the old system is not going be skewed toward American interests in anything remotely like the old, now defunct system.     Go ahead, elect a senile, sociopathic imbecile President of the United States of America.  What could possibly go wrong?",Beantown-Jack,2025-04-22T11:31:57,163

"And the base of maga (unlike the OG Republican Party) are poor folks, folks with bad job prospects, folks on fixed incomes, folks that can’t afford groceries or medical care…  They are people that were already suffering a great deal in this economy.  New tax burdens being placed on their shoulders in the form of tarrifs (everything at Walmart and Dollar General will be way more expensive than it used to be). Inflationary activity by the Trump administration weakening their already limited dollars and their buying power. Grocery prices only going up from here on out…  They’re just going to get utterly destroyed by this administration.   They are going to go from “struggling” in this economy to outright despair, bankruptcy, joblessness, hunger and even homelessness.   That is what is headed for them. And they are the maga base.

I can tell you my mom’s partner knows his 401k is declining but he doesn’t understand investments at all. He won’t even check his investments online. He has to call. And he wants to retire in a couple months. He does understand it’s declining because of Trump’s policies but he thinks things will get better because that’s what Fox tells him.
