"Not for nothing, but I'm always skeptical of articles that fail to cite the study they're talking about.  Neither this article, nor the newsweek article it links to, cite the study.  While I'm pretty sure this is true, I'm also pretty sure its deceptively true.  We've been seeing for a few years now a widening ideological gap between young men and young women.  I suspect the results being talking about in this article would indicate, if we were able to see the original study, that as an aggregate young people skew more conservative than progressive, but when broken down we will find that it is primarily young *men* who are skewing the results.  Why it matters?  Because losing half the young person voting bloc is not something to get complacent about due having been fed deceptively-edited information about how secure the young person voting bloc is.",Shadeylark,2025-04-18T06:29:55,183

You can’t say that they were the most conservative when Baby Boomers still exist, and 20 years ago the Slient Generation still existed and failed to keep Gen X’s excesses in check.

There are a million different reasons you can argue against Roe v. Wade that never bring religion into the discussion at all.  What ultra religious conservatives don't realize is that there are many people within our own party that have chosen not to have families, chosen not to marry, who support abortion access in states that voted for it, who believe in anyone's right to marriage, etc. It's important that we focus on actual conservative stances to ensure we keep ALL of our party together.",DietCokeYummie,2025-04-22T09:24:32,3

The political left dominated US Media for decades, but they got caught with their pants down as the media landscape shifted from the TV news of old to the age of Youtube and podcasts. And it came at them from two angles: first, conservatives actually had a meaningful voice in the media for the first time basically ever, but the other side of it is that in the realm of podcasts and political influencers, the left really *didn't* have a voice, not to the same extent that the right did.  The death of legacy (TV-based) media was inevitable as technology changed. This wasn't some 4D chess move by conservatives to intentionally alter the media landscape. People were never going to keep watching cable TV. The fact that the Democratic Party got so blindsided by this, especially after the success that Obama had in using the internet to appeal to young (millennial) voters is truly baffling.",homestar92,2025-04-18T07:59:06,12
I think Millennials grew up in very bad Republican movements like the satanic panic and now they don't see that the left is the modern version of all that was bad with Republicans at the time.,kaytin911,2025-04-18T04:45:55,12

They stand for whatever the TV tells them. No joke these are people who operate based solely on social proof and argument from their authority. Look up Asch conformity and Milgram experiments that's basically who makes up the left today.,day25,2025-04-18T11:49:51,24
"Yeah, I wasn't talking about Gen X being lib. I was talking about them raising kids that ended up being libs (Millennials). Source: Am a millennial and finding other people my age who are conservative is impossible. If anything there's a good chunk of Libertarians. However, it seems the default is liberal.",Vile-The-Terrible,2025-04-18T10:57:43,5
"You're getting downvoted, but that's exactly why I said what I said.  And here's a link:  [https://www.aei.org/op-eds/trumps-dramatic-and-ironic-gains-with-gen-x/](https://www.aei.org/op-eds/trumps-dramatic-and-ironic-gains-with-gen-x/)",TedriccoJones,2025-04-18T04:12:56,13
"I would argue that approval rating of a president does not = conservative principles necessarily. Especially when said president has a mix of both 90s democratic and 80s republican stances.  Gen X trended more areligious or agnostic than probably silent and baby boomers, and trends more towards the left than their parents.  The coalition that Trump has formed this time around has ex democrats in its ranks and is appealing to more sane takes of a bygone age that older democrats would be completely on board for (immigration and social issues). Therefore, approval rating isn’t really indicative of anything other than they like how Trump is currently running things.   How they raised their kids is a completely different story.  To say Gen X is *the most conservative* generation is giving them way too much credit. They, along with a large portion of millennials, have caused irreparable harm because a large portion of these two generations completely lost the plot when it comes to values. Not saying they were or are all bad, but they aren’t exact a shining example of conservative values.",Javierinho23,2025-04-18T00:29:29,-6
"Absolutely. The type of leftists you see on Reddit are VERY extreme compared to IRL. I was left leaning for many years (2020 sent me to the right), and many of my friends still are. Zero of them are unhinged lunatics. In fact, many share the same beliefs as myself.  Of course, I'm in the deep south, so it's to be expected. Leftists down here tend to be not all that different from right wing people in more blue areas.  > the left let the loonies take over the party.  Funny enough, when I was watching the coverage the day after the last election when Trump won, many leftists were ADMITTING this. Every time someone was shocked-pikachu-face over their loss, a leftist talking head would point out the very polarizing issues they shouldn't have clung to or allowed to take over the party.",DietCokeYummie,2025-04-22T09:33:44,1
It's boomers that have caused the most harm. If you look at the Tesla protests they're also mostly old people. If you think boomers treated their kids softly then I have a bridge to sell you.,kaytin911,2025-04-18T04:37:48,3
