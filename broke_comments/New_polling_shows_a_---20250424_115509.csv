3 out of 4 Republicans still think Trump has a solid economic plan...,Gesticulating_Goat,2025-04-24T11:58:49,183
US retailers put their Christmas orders in this time of year.  With all of the uncertainty the orders are on pause.  There is a better than 50% chance that the shelves will be empty this Christmas in the US.  If that happens Trump will be remembered as the üçä grinch who stole Christmas.  I don‚Äôt think üçä grinch‚Äôs poll well.  Watch this link it is an interview with the CEO of Flexport a logistics company.  He sees a lot of pain.  He said that world wide shipping out of China is down 50%.    https://youtu.be/-dgHWv-Dh6Q?si=Uz6rBBUPtQfzc0K_,TubeframeMR2,2025-04-24T12:00:42,72

"Statistics in this type of case can be very misleading. Cases where someone can move from one group to another, especially when they are unhappy with the current group, are very unintutive. In fact, paradoxically, every subgroup can have their support percentage increase or decrease and have the actual global support be the opposite (Simpson's paradox). I would expect that eventually everyone who isn't full MAGA cult will leave the party. This will paradoxically make his Republican support appear to increase (only hardcore MAGA remain) with independent or democrat support decreasing as unhappy ex-Republicans become unhappy, hesitant independents or democrats. Statistics is very difficult to reason about intuitively, and only apples to apples cohort analysis can really be trusted as intuitively understood.",Professor-Woo,2025-04-24T18:10:46,1

"Yes but let‚Äôs break that down. The republican favorable impression is coming from a certain imaginary line towards the right, everyone on that side still says yep we are in.   The democrats are getting hate for being democrats from the right and then they are getting hates on by many democrats for being wimps and not taking on the right.  So I think that number is a little misleading.

"75% of Democrats approve of Democrats. All this tells me is Democrats are more likely to be self assessing, and at this moment they are not in power so the base will be less happy.
