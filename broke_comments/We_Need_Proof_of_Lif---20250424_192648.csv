"Absolutely. We cannot forget about these other people. We cannot let this story die, just like Trump thinks it will because of the ramped up news cycle caused by his fucking tweets.",Podwitchers,2025-04-24T19:39:42,1
"He came to the US seeking asylum out of fear for how he was being treated in his home country. And we do this.  This is and will be a source of national shame and I am ashamed to be an American under this regime.  Yeah, proof of life would be great.  And his freedom.  And a national reckoning on what weâ€™ve become.",CrimsonFeetofKali,2025-04-24T19:39:06,1
"This is absolutely horrific.  I keep thinking about this poor man after reading about him here, too:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1jxz51v/andry\_romero\_a\_gay\_makeup\_artist\_sent\_to\_el/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1jxz51v/andry_romero_a_gay_makeup_artist_sent_to_el/)  More proof this administration is EVIL.",CouchCorrespondent,2025-04-24T19:56:33,1
"I'm glad to see another article about Andry HernÃ¡ndez Romero, along with this one from earlier: [https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1k6zocc/we\_know\_donald\_trump\_wants\_the\_story\_to\_die/](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1k6zocc/we_know_donald_trump_wants_the_story_to_die/)  He hasn't committed any crimes. He was falsely accused of being a gang member just because of tattoos dedicated to his parents. He was praying and crying for his mother when he was taken into CECOT and having his head shaved.  He's just a nice, innocent person who wasn't hurting anyone, and he was thrown into a concentration camp. Unless any information comes out saying otherwise, I'll assume he's still at CECOT and still hasn't had any contact with the outside world. **That means he doesn't know how many people are fighting for him or when or if he'll ever get out.**  Andry HernÃ¡ndez Romero's name deserves to be everywhere. Media, politicians, regular people like us... we all need to make sure he's not forgotten about!!  Don't forget about the 200+ others either!!!",sachiprecious,2025-04-24T21:12:46,1

"First article I've read that refers to CECOT as ""gulag in El Salvador"". This needs to be said more!",PackFan72,2025-04-24T20:28:38,1
The ENTIRE program needs to be dismantled and we should stop propping up dictators and exporting coups.,mingusdynasty,2025-04-24T20:28:16,1
"I have been praying to wherever deities may be listening for the safety of Andry Romero, since I saw that photo of his head being shaved as he cried. We cannot let this go.",Ninetyglazeddonuts,2025-04-24T21:46:39,1
"Yes, we do. I canâ€™t stop thinking about this man. And Iâ€™ve been troubled about the way he has somewhat disappeared from the primary discussion. His lawyer had a hearing yesterday that amounted to nothing and the next one isnâ€™t until late May. Thatâ€™s excruciatingly slow for an innocent who is living (assuming heâ€™s alive, which I am, but since this article is about proof of life itâ€™s worth mentioning) in such horrible conditions.",Idkfriendsidk,2025-04-24T21:30:41,1
"I know, Hegseth wants to set up a makeup studio at the Pentagon!  This artist could work there!",FormerUsenetUser,2025-04-24T20:19:58,1
Maybe they can bring him back to help Pete Hegseth with his makeup?,BannedForEternity42,2025-04-24T20:55:23,1
His name is Andry Romero. Where is he?!,Crochetcreature,2025-04-24T22:34:07,1
Iâ€™ve been wondering about the others. All of them. This is just insane.,Arose1316,2025-04-24T22:57:08,1
"It honestly seems like he's running out of steam when it comes to flooding the zone. Only so many days he can throw out new tariff numbers and surprise department cuts, it's getting repetitive and El Salvador is horrific enough to outlast the other distractions.",ImLikeReallySmart,2025-04-24T22:11:05,1
