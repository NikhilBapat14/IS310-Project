"Short answer: no.   Long answer: there’s a number of factors, some of which are discussed in [this article](https://www.masslive.com/news/2024/11/mit-to-offer-free-tuition-to-households-with-income-below-200k.html).",ajw_sp,2024-11-27T11:09:08,11
"It’s exactly the opposite. Back in 2017, his administration cut funding for financial aid, thus Universities stepped up.  https://www.americanprogress.org/article/trumps-budget-cynical-attack-college-students/  https://www.acenet.edu/News-Room/Pages/Trump-Budget-Slashes-Higher-Education-Along-With-Other-Domestic-Programs.aspx  Edit:  Here’s a great breakdown of all the harm Trump & DeVos caused to our educational systems from pre-school through post-grad  https://www.psea.org/news—events/Publications/voice-november-2020/biden-vs.-trump-on-education/",honeychild7878,2024-11-27T12:09:13,5
"Yeah--and I think the key thing to understand is that most of these universities were *already* quietly giving free tuition to the vast majority of low-income students, and have been for a while. It just wasn't public. Eventually they realized that if they publicized that info and made it into an official guarantee, it would mean that more students would apply. There were a lot of low-income students who had the ability to get in but didn't bother to apply because they didn't think they could afford it.  So the change wasn't really that the universities are spending substantially more, it's just that they're publicizing the spending they were already doing.",anneoftheisland,2024-11-27T17:00:52,3

"And it looks like MIT in particular has expanded the definition of ""low income"" from 140K to 200K/year. Which looks silly at first glance, but in real life it's pretty sensible.  Remember, too, that students still have to be admitted - a very big bar for low income students coming from mediocre high schools. A very high bar for any students, really.",loweexclamationpoint,2024-12-06T10:28:50,1
"Weird, it was up 6 days ago.
