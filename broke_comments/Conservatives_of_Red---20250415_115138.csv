"The tech company I work for is getting raked over the coals with tariffs. We are now partially in the new exemptions, but who knows how long that will be. Also seems like the winners of the trade war are getting selectively chosen right now, which is hurting competition, especially for small businesses.",check_your_bias7,2025-04-15T19:50:42,604

"Personally, your anecdote of ‚Äúnothing has changed‚Äù doesn‚Äôt provide much to anyone who it has changed for significantly.  Tariff announcements have shit on most people‚Äôs 401ks, and caused ripple effects in material costs and manufacturing.   Prices of goods have absolutely gone up, which is what happens when the market anticipates cost of goods going up, and responds proactively. Just because you failed to notice it doesn‚Äôt in any way change the reality of it.",AleksanderSuave,2025-04-16T08:33:35,49

"I¬†work in the tech sector, and the supply chain disruptions we‚Äôre experiencing are severe, so much so that we can‚Äôt reliably plan for future opportunities.

"Mostly the same. I've seen people talk about lowered gas prices, but they've been around $3.20 for me basically all year. They briefly came down a couple of weeks ago, but now they're back up. Others say their egg prices are down, but I'm not seeing that change.  Otherwise, nothing's really changed. The liberals I know and talk with aren't doing crazy things or being irrational, angry people. In fact, there's not much political discussion at all. It's all about the same as it ever was. I didn't expect the world to have changed by now, but I also find it surprising when others point out drastic changes because I can't say there's anywhere I've seen it.",cubs223425,2025-04-15T12:21:44,346

A friend of a friend works for an NGO that gets the majority of their funding from USAID, and they are pretty stressed. It brings me no joy hearing these stories but my private company did layoffs last year the the government never has so it's natural and not cruel they'll have to go through this stress with some staying and some getting laid off.

"Tier three manufacturer.  Already been seeing an uptick in orders from our customers who used to outsource their production overseas but would rather not deal with the tariffs now.  Whether this will stick is anybody's guess, but so far the tariffs have been good for business here, even if they've been a bit of a pain due to dealing with new suppliers and whatnot.  But that would've happened regardless if production at rebased some other way anyways.  It's a nice change after four years of having to cut hours and layoff people.  Outside of work, nothing has changed at all but except now I have to listen to my parents complain about how much they've lost in their retirement and how they won't be able to do as much travelling in the next few years.  I love my folks, and I sympathize with them... But having spent up until only recently living paycheck to paycheck and being closer to retirement age than not now... I fully expect to get at most a couple shitty years off work before I die, not twenty plus years of retirement travelling wherever I feel like it... So its tough to sympathize too much.
