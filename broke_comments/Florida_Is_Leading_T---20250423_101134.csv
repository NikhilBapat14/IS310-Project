Didn't they just jail a citizen?,OhWhatsHisName,2025-04-23T10:14:43,8
"At least CHP and other California PDs show the example by not helping, though I wish they could stop ICE (yes, it would illegal for CHP to interfere with an ICE deportation operation, but let’s not pretend Trump cares about the law).",Hero-Firefighter-24,2025-04-23T10:13:05,5
"Florida law enforcement is full of high school losers and religious zealots who have a bone to pick with society so they run to positions of power where they feel safe in their brotherhood. Just look at Grady Judd, Fl Sheriffs association, FHP, chalk full of absolute trash humans. ",Kind-Afternoon8399,2025-04-23T11:53:39,3
"All this does is make things less safe.  If someone witnesses is a violent crime or is a victim of one, but is afraid they'll get deported if they seek help, they aren't going to call 911. People could literally get away with murder because of this.  It's incredibly stupid for LLE to get involved in this sort of matter.",Dogdiscsanddyes,2025-04-23T10:27:49,2
Big surprise. Desantis went on that hiring bender a few years ago where he was hiring and poaching the worst of the worst from departments across the country.,jdspinkpanther,2025-04-23T14:32:44,2
I wonder how many job positions these people filled that are not vacant? Do they have businesses that can't function now because they lost their employees?,Fairymask,2025-04-23T10:21:36,1

"Legal residents and citizens have worker protections.  Increasing numbers of H-2A workers can be refused overtime, vacations, and sick time.  That's why Trump wants the residents out.",MentalTourniquet,2025-04-23T10:42:59,0
yeah but he was brown.,RabidGuineaPig007,2025-04-23T14:58:25,2
"not just h-2a workers get denied ot, sick time and vacations. My sister left behind paper work from when her husband was on probation and employed by a catering company. she got her hands on a memo direction a change of job title (caterer to driver) so that he would, 'not get overtime' and would not get his weekend off. My sister was an advocate that many do not have. This is the evil that is the core of trumpisim encompasses, deny representation and punish those who need protection the most.",Several-Pattern-7989,2025-04-23T20:25:34,2
