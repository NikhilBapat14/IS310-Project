It’s all desperation and hurried attempts at trying to halt promises from happening.,ITrCool,2025-04-21T21:33:00,18
"If the lower courts would reject more of these cases as meritless/frivolous as they should, the judicial system wouldn't be under the pressure it is now. But justice isn't blind in the courts of judicial activist judges who want to inject their personal politics into every case brought before them.",social_dinosaur,2025-04-22T08:21:06,6
So why did they half bake their own decision to tell trump to halt using the 1798 act to get rid of dangerous illegal aliens?    The Supreme Court has been compromised,luderiffic,2025-04-21T22:08:36,9
"using the alien enemies act as trump  is doing is a somewhat novel application of the law, mainly declaring invasion. there is a lot to go over and consider before a ruling will be made as to whether it is a legal interpretation of that law. for example the exec can definitely defend against invasion without congress approval  no issue there. can a president declare an invasion? not sure. is the tie to venezuela enough to invoke the aea?  not sure.  Things need to be adjudicated at lower courts to build a body of pro and con evidence and pleadings for scotus to look at.",SerendipitySue,2025-04-22T13:31:12,1
Obstructionism and judge shopping 🤷🏻‍♂️,indefiniteretrieval,2025-04-22T07:07:32,7
"There are cases challenging it and we're going to end up with different districts with conflicting decisions, which means the Supreme Court is going to have to take the case up at some point.  This leaves the court two options: pause deportation under this law until they can rule, or let them continue. The whole Garcia debacle showed us that it's impossible to bring people back after deportation. Meanwhile, keeping people here for a few more months until they can rule causes very little harm.  People keep painting this as some betrayal by the court. It's not. They probably will rule in Trump's favor. That said, this is a minor procedural ruling. People on both sides need to drop blowing it up to be a bigger deal than it is.",cathbadh,2025-04-22T06:38:30,11

I just don’t have faith they will.,luderiffic,2025-04-22T10:05:46,2
"This is what I've been thinking.  It's looking like SCOTUS is reaching the point of saying, ""Enough!""  In addition to your points, I also think they may be wanting to head off congressional regulation of judicial scope.",Celebril63,2025-04-22T11:05:45,2
"It is possible he's applying the law wrong. The court is 9 people. They can't all be conspiring against him. If it turns out he is wrong somehow, there are other legal avenues to deport people.",cathbadh,2025-04-22T10:17:20,7
I think that latter part is a big deal too.  Threats to regulate them by Republicans are up there with the threats by Dems to force a code of conduct on them. The court needs to defend their independence,cathbadh,2025-04-22T12:22:35,2
"None of the branches are particularly fond of the other two branches invoking their checks on them.    I think there's actually enough momentum that if regulation were attached to the funding of the courts, and thus avoiding a filibuster option, there's a real chance it would get through.    Frankly, at this rate, I can even see enough public pressure building that there might even be a chance to get cloture in a regular bill, even.  It's still odds against, but it is a better chance than it was 2 months ago.",Celebril63,2025-04-22T14:56:21,1
">I think there's actually enough momentum that if regulation were attached to the funding of the courts, and thus avoiding a filibuster option, there's a real chance it would get through.   There is a chance as the Democrats would wholeheartedly support it since the next time they have control we'd be handing them a precedent to cut court funding until they follow a ethics code carefully crafted to only hurt the conservative members, and ensure they start ruling ""properly.""  Then we can go back and forth strong-arming the court until they cease to be relevant.",cathbadh,2025-04-22T17:06:07,1
