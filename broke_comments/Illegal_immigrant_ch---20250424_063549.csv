"Van Hollend doesn’t care about the murdered mom, this was about publicity for Van Hollen in supporting an MS 13 gang member but he really doesn’t care about Kilmar either, it just gives him publicity, it is narcissist behavior is all!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-24T07:46:40,51
"U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) charged an illegal immigrant with the murder of a mother in Maryland on Wednesday, just five days after Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., returned to the state from his high-profile El Salvador visit to try to retrieve a deported alleged MS-13 member.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-24T08:20:27,20

"The left’s priorities:    1. Protecting violent illegal immigrants. 2. Transing your kids 3. Keeping the gravy train of tax dollars flowing into Harvard 4. Funding far-left propaganda (e.g., USAID, PBS, NPR)",RedditsLittleSecret,2025-04-24T09:50:18,21
"NO SQUATTER'S RIGHTS FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS  They don't get to sneak into an unattended house (the United States) and simply squat while taking advantage of due process with every delay tactic available.  Similar to how states are dealing with the scourge of squatters by speeding up the due process dramatically, we need to speed up due process to remove non-citizens who were uncompassionately left in limbo by a prior administration who refused to enforce the law.",CallMeCassandra,2025-04-24T09:00:39,21
Van Hollen doesn’t care just like he doesn’t care about the guy in El Salvador. It’s only about his own phony virtue signaling and publicity that the taxpayers paid for his private jet round trip.,Lifeisagreatteacher,2025-04-24T07:38:00,14
