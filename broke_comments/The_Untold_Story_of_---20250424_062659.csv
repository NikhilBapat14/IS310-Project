"Hi r/politics,  Did you know that Ed Martin, interim D.C. U.S. attorney, secretly ghostwrote online attacks on an Illinois judge?  The attacks began on Facebook in 2016, after the judge dealt Martin a major setback in a case. Posted by someone named Priscilla Gray, they impugned the judge's ethics and branded him as a ""politician"" with the “LOWEST rating for a judge in Illinois.”  As it turns out, **behind the posts about the judge was none other than Martin**.  We obtained emails showing that after Martin bought a laptop for Gray, she offered to “happily write something to attack this judge.” And when she did, Martin ghostwrote more posts for her to use.  A legal ethics expert told us the emails were evidence that Martin had attempted to send messages to a judge through a proxy, in violation of Missouri’s rules for lawyers.  Martin did not respond to requests for comment. Asked about the emails in a deposition, Martin declined to talk about them, but did acknowledge that lawyers are prohibited from communicating with judges outside of court or engaging in conduct intended to disrupt the court.  This isn't the only untold story about Martin that we uncovered. **Here's the full investigation**: [https://www.propublica.org/article/ed-martin-trump-interim-dc-us-attorney-secret-judge-attacks](https://www.propublica.org/article/ed-martin-trump-interim-dc-us-attorney-secret-judge-attacks)",propublica_,2025-04-24T06:33:33,5
*Still* ?   More like 'because'.   Lack of ethics seem to be a prerequisite for bootlickers of Agent Orange.,The_Glum_Reaper,2025-04-24T06:34:22,2
