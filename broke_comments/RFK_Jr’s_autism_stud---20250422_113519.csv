Historically we know that natural philosopher Henry Cavendish was autistic and that was noted after 1766. Vaccinations were not really a thing yet. We know it goes back to ancient Greece with stories of shut-ins frequently appear in literature of the time. Prometheus's punishment as well as Daedalus's confinement are examinations of autism in early human society.,BoringThePerson,2025-04-22T12:11:43,13

"I work in healthcare.  You need a warrant, subpoena, or ROI to gain access to medical records.  Even HIPAA consent, at least where I work, needs the specific name of a person from a school or facility or I cannot speak to them.  I get full names and phone numbers for consent, multiple identifiers because anyone can call and say they're so and so and want information on a patient.  Even to participate in studies, there are ethics and laws that have to be followed (ie do no harm, provide patient education, etc) and people have to opt in and consent to be included in a study.

He didnt provide any information so it's too broad to really discuss exact legal implications, although the law would absolutely get involved.  I can't see anything coming of this, I also cannot see the wellness camps becoming a thing.  I think healthcare orgs and pharma would fight WAY harder than most attorney offices did.  you can't just cut major funding (like trump threatens universities) to healthcare without severely straining resources and impacting care, people would die.  Even Medicare/Medicaid they're trying to be quiet about because they KNOW the backlash they'd get.  Also, medicine is COMPLETELY evidence-based.  It's what guides healthcare, as much as RFK wants to axe psych treatments and preventative care, the evidence is THERE to prove HARM.  healthcare is all about ""do no harm""",ManicMalkavian,2025-04-22T13:02:00,6
