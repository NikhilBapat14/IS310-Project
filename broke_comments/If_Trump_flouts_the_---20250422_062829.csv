"This should also apply to states rather than just individuals, because that saves you the effort to build up a political structure to challenge the authoritarians from.

The linchpin of the authoritarian narrative is the fairy tale that they stand for order and control. Make sure everyone sees that they don't.

"Not yet. The constitutional crisis happens when Trump acknowledges a SCOTUS ruling and says he will not comply. What he has done so far is say that he recognises the authority of the Supreme Court and believes (no matter how insane) he is complying with the order. Now just because rational people disagree with his interpretation of compliance does not mean it's a constitutional crisis.  Calling a constitutional crisis before it happens will diminish the reaction when it does happen. We're close, but not there yet.  Edit: show me the court that has found the government in contempt for defying their order. Not tweets, not quotes. Until the judiciary tells him to do something and then decides he hasn't done it, it's not a constitutional crisis. This is a legal matter, not an emotional one.

"I think that conversation was actually very damning evidence that Trump did not and will not legitimately ask and make an attempt for Garcia to return.  In a nutshell this is what happened:  Bueke: I cannot send the terrorist back to the US if the US will not take him back.  I can't smuggle him into the US.  Trump Admin:  We cannot take the terorrist back if Bukele will not send him back.  This is a circular argument.  The US saying that Bukele won't release him and Bukele saying the US won't take him.  So, both of them are denying responsibility.  In almost any other normal circumstance when Bukele claimed that he can't ""smuggle a terrorist back into the US,"" the US president would have stopeed him and said on national television that the US will accept him back and if they will provide a time then the US will have a plane on the tarmac ready to pick Garcia up and return him to the US for due process.  Put Bukele's feet to the fire and make him say no on national television.  Yet, that isn't what happened in this instance.  Instead, the Trump admin spent 99 percent of their time defaming Garcia.  In terms of court, the court would ask the Trump admin to show exactly what they have done to try to get Garcia back.  What requests they have made to do so and what plans they laid out to get him back.  Did they offer the use of a plane, did they offer a time and a date, did they offer to pay for the time/expense to transport Garcia to the airport?  These sort of details can determine whether or not the Trump admin seriously attempted to facilitate his return.  If they merely went, ""Hey, will you give him back?"" Then that likely isn't going to be enough to have shown that they made a valid attempt.  Think of it another way... when I used to do child support cases, to avoid my client going to jail for failure to pay and/or have a job I would have my client bring copies of applications they filled out and screen shots of applications.  I would have then write down dates of when they had interviews.  Then, when we got to court I could provide the court with proof that they tried to actually find a job but were not successful.  Often times, showing this level of effort was enough to keep them from jail time.  However, if they just showed up and testified that they tried and filled out applications and named some random places then that likely wasn't enough to keep them out of jail because the court didn't believe they'd really actually tried.",WhatRUHourly,2025-04-22T10:26:06,3

In other words, if someone took an accurate history of the Florida recount, and **then rewrote the accurate history with time running backwards**, your description would partly match the time-reversed history.  A very brief summary of the actual events: at first, votes were recounted only  in a few counties that supported Gore. The Gore campaign didn't immediately call for a statewide recount (which I believe was a mistake on their part). However, the key point is that  ""On December 8, the Florida Supreme Court, by a 4‚Äì3 vote, rejected the selective use of manual recounts in just four counties and ordered **immediate manual recounts of all ballots in the state** where no vote for president had been machine-recorded, also known as undervotes.""  The **Gore campaign / Democratic Party supported the statewide manual recount** as soon as it was ordered by the Florida Supreme Court. They definitely didn't file any lawsuit to block the statewide recount, or restrict the  recount to counties that supported Gore.  The **Bush campaign / Republican Party opposed the statewide manual recount** and went to the US Supreme Court (SCOTUS) to block the statewide recount. They didn't want any recount because they were leading by a few hundred votes in the initial count. SCOTUS ordered the statewide recount to stop, which is what the Bush campaign wanted to happen.  ""On December 9, the **U.S. Supreme Court suspended the \[statewide\] manual recount**, in progress for only several hours, on the grounds that **irreparable harm could befall Bush**, according to a concurring opinion by Justice¬†[Antonin Scalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonin_Scalia).""

No one arguing this is excusing the disregard- constitutional law is based on definitions and clarity.

"A reporter asking Bukele if he's planning to send the man back on his own and Bukele saying he doesn't have the authority to smuggle a person into the US isn't anything like what you're portraying. Why do you think Trump asked him bring him back?   **REPORTER:** Do you support extension for National Southern Salvador under temporary protection status? You plan to ask President to help return the man who your administration says was mistakenly deported, the man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador?  **PRESIDENT TRUMP:** Well, let me ask Pam. Would you answer that question?  **PAM BONDI:** Sure, President. First and foremost, this man is from El Salvador, which is President Bukele‚Äôs country. He had been illegally in our country. And in 2019, two courts, an immigration court and an appellate immigration court, ruled that he was a member of MS-13, and he was illegally in our country. Right now, it was a paperwork issue. Additional paperwork had needed to be done. That‚Äôs up to El Salvador if they want to return him. That‚Äôs not up to us. The Supreme Court ruled, president, that if El Salvador wants to return him, this is international matters, foreign affairs, if they wanted to return him, we would facilitate it, meaning provide a plane.  **REPORTER:** So will you return him, President Trump?  **PRESIDENT TRUMP:** You are doing a great job. Wait a minute. Can you just also respond to that question? Because it‚Äôs asked by CNN, and they always ask it with a slant because they‚Äôre totally slanted. They don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening. That‚Äôs why nobody is watching them. But would you answer that question also?  **UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:** Yes, gladly. So as Pam mentioned, there‚Äôs a legal alien from El Salvador. So with respect to you, he‚Äôs a citizen of El Salvador. So it‚Äôs very arrogant even for American media to suggest that we would even tell El Salvador how to handle their own citizens as a starting point.  As two immigration courts found that he was a member of MS-13, when President Trump declared MS-13 to be a foreign terrorist organization, that meant that he was no longer eligible under federal law, which I‚Äôm sure you know, you‚Äôre very familiar with the INA, that he was no longer eligible for any form of immigration relief in The United States. So he had a deportation order that was valid, which meant that under our law, he‚Äôs not even allowed to be present in The United States and had to be returned because of the foreign terrorist designation.  No version of this legally ends up with him ever living here because he is a citizen of El Salvador. That is the President of El Salvador. Your questions about per the court can only be directed to him.  **REPORTER**: President Bukele, can you weigh in on this? Do you plan to return him?  **PRESIDENT BUKELE:** Well, I guess you‚Äôre supposed to have suggested that I smuggle terrorists into The United States, right? How can I smuggle him? How can I return him to The United States? If I could, would I smuggle him to The United States or would I do the course? I‚Äôm not going to do it. It‚Äôs like, the question is preposterous. How can I smuggle a terrorist into The United States? I don‚Äôt have the power to return him to The United States.  **REPORTER:** So you can release him inside of El Salvador?  **PRESIDENT BUKELE:** Yes, but I‚Äôm not releasing him. I mean, we‚Äôre not very fond of releasing terrorists into our country. We just turned the murder capital of the world into the safest country in the Western Hemisphere, and you want us to go back into releasing criminals so we can go back to being the murder capital of the world. And that‚Äôs not going to happen.  **PRESIDENT TRUMP:** Well, they‚Äôd love to have a criminal. I mean, there‚Äôs a fascination. They would love it. They‚Äôre sick people. Marco, do you have something to say about that?  **MARCO RUBIO:** Yes. I mean, Steve and I outlined it. I don‚Äôt understand what the confusion is. This individual is a citizen of El Salvador. He was illegally in The United States and was returned to his country.  That‚Äôs where you deport people back to their country of origin, except for Venezuela that wasn‚Äôt refusing to take people back or places like that. I can tell you this, Mr. President, the foreign policy of The United States is conducted by the President of The United States, not by a court. And no court in The United States has a right to conduct the foreign policy of the United States. It‚Äôs that simple. End of story.  **UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:** And that‚Äôs what the Supreme Court held, by the way, to Marco‚Äôs point. The Supreme Court said exactly what Marco said, that no court has the authority to compel the foreign policy function in United States. We won a case nine-zero, and people like CNN are portraying it as a loss, as usual, because they want foreign terrorists in the country who kidnap women and children. But President Trump‚Äôs policy is foreign terrorists that are here illegally get expelled from the country, which, by the way, is a ninety-ten issue.  **REPORTER:** Well, President, Mr. President, you said that if the Supreme Court said someone needed to be returned, that you would abide by that. You said that on Air Force One just a few days ago. And they said that it must be‚Äî  **PRESIDENT TRUMP:** Why don‚Äôt you just say, isn‚Äôt it wonderful that we‚Äôre keeping criminals out of our country? Why can‚Äôt you just say that? Why do you go over and over? And that‚Äôs why nobody watches you anymore. You have no credibility. Please go ahead.",RellenD,2025-04-22T10:18:13,4
