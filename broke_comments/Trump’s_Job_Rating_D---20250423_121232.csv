"The first 100 days of a presidency is when they get the most accomplished, typically. Trump’s first 100 have been marked by lawsuits, scandals, hostility, and failure.",Ancient_Popcorn,2025-04-23T12:18:08,21
His numbers are still way too high for where they should be. Isn't he still higher now than he was at this same point in his first term? It's crazy. We need a serious education overhaul in this country if someone this terrible can become our leader.,TheRandomHumanoid,2025-04-23T12:23:07,11

"The drop in this poll is rather steep, going from -2 in their previous poll to -19 in this one. Pew tends to be a bit D friendly from my experience so the drop is a bit of an outlier so far. I believe Trump's favorables are now around where they were at this point in his first term.",Isentrope,2025-04-23T14:48:44,3
What he's doing to Ukraine right now is definitely apocalyptic for us Europeans.,angrydopaminehunter,2025-04-23T12:57:46,6
