"Surprise surprise, Donald Trump was not being honest about talking to China",HerpesIsItchy,2025-04-24T08:09:25,7
"China, you're getting it all wrong. There are talks going about a US-China trade deal. But they're between Trump and Putin. Once they've worked out the details, you'll be informed and asked to sign on the dotted line. It's just how the US rolls these days.",Rannasha,2025-04-24T08:48:49,4
Donald is so far over his head. China knows how badly T has mangled negotiation by tipping his hand so publicly. Plus they can read our media as well as any of us noting the outrage and controversy caused by Donalds public fumbling and day to day concessions.,jpmondx,2025-04-24T08:33:05,3

"I’m looking for a serious answer, if they are constantly talking about the threat of China, how much money we owe them, how much we buy from them, and expand our military in order to directly square off with china, what made them think China would bend the knee on these tariffs? Like they know they own a ton of our securities. Was there another negotiating angle that was on the table?",rundmz8668,2025-04-24T08:55:55,1

"Possibly, but China, like America, will say whatever it wants. If china thinks discrediting Trump advances their position, they will probably say whatever they want.",18212182,2025-04-24T08:50:04,0
"> what made them think China would bend the knee on these tariffs?  They did not think China would say no.  >Was there another negotiating angle that was on the table?  No.  Trump wanted tariffs so that is what he did. Trump thinks he's CEO King of USA and can do whatever he wants. So, Trump wanted tariffs. Trump did not want a plan to help improve the daily lives of people living in USA. Trump wanted tariffs. How does Trump get want he wants? Mob tactics. Extortion. Bulling. Protection money.  There were never going to be negotiations. Either the world does what Trump wants or the tariff goes higher.   Trump Tariffs Like 'Delinquent Kid Extorting Somebody'—Japanese Lawmaker   https://www.newsweek.com/trump-tariffs-delinquent-kid-extorting-somebody-japanese-lawmaker-2061460    >Oguma in a speech during a parliamentary committee hearing told Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya that the nation should resist Trump's demands, likening the U.S. approach as a ""delinquent kid extorting someone,"" according to a Times of India translation.  >""If Japan listens to this and bends the other way in response to the impossible demands of bargaining and deals, it will set a bad example as a customary and historical precedent,"" Oguma said. ""If you get mugged and put money in their hands, they will come back to mug us.""  >Oguma called Trump's tariff formula ""a mess"" and questioned if it was ""safe for a serious person to go there"" and negotiate with the U.S.  >""Consider every option, but you should never make concessions to someone who is not straight up anyway,"" Oguma said, adding: ""I hope that you will never give in to the American extortionists. I know this is harsh to say, but they are extortionists.""  >""If you listen to what they say, it will be a really bad example,"" Oguma said.  >Iwaya meanwhile has called for a diplomatic approach to the still-developing U.S. trade policy, comparing the regular changes to ""a daily menu."" He previously called the tariffs ""regrettable,"" according to Japanese outlet Kyodo News.

He literally just caved after a meeting with Target so apparently someone has influence,rundmz8668,2025-04-24T12:16:57,2
"Trump hired people to run USA because he saw them on TV. Jared also hired Peter Navarro based on the cover of a book he saw an Amazon while doing research on China per Trump's request.    Yeah, lots of stuff influences Trump. Remember the time during a rally he just stopped and swayed to music on stage for 45 minutes?",tech57,2025-04-24T13:09:26,3
"It’s crazy that like you can just put people in such important jobs with no one there to train them on how to do that job. Those people would be the deep state, or “institutional knowledge” haha",rundmz8668,2025-04-24T17:29:01,1
