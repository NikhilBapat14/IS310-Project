His son's killer has raised over 500k.  Clown world.  These people are sick.,Pinot_Greasio,2025-04-19T22:55:13,321

"Judging from what Karmelo's family has been saying, I'm guessing they're not big on prayer.",Merax75,2025-04-19T23:17:23,207
This guy really thought he was going to pray with the family that is actively defending murdering his son? C'mon.,RandolphE6,2025-04-20T00:08:35,147
He needs to stop being so naive. I’m sorry for his loss but he needs to stay home and let the process play out. If Karmelo is acquitted I’d like to see if he’s still willing to pray w them ,CalmHabit3,2025-04-19T23:43:30,135
This guy's behavior is so odd. Dragging his dead son's name through the mud is going to likely be their strategy at trial. Let's see if he still wants to pray with them after that.,Flint__Sky,2025-04-20T03:09:26,63
The father of slain teen Austin Metcalf said he hoped he could pray with the family of his son’s alleged killer — but wound up feeling “disrespected” when he showed up earlier this week at a press conference organized by the accused slayer’s kin and got thrown out.,Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-20T04:40:21,14
Keep raising that cash!  It'll be great for the Metcalf family after the Civil suit.,ACP772,2025-04-20T07:34:46,9
The dad seems to be a self flagellating type.,kaytin911,2025-04-20T06:42:28,13
And that is just for starters.  They ought to be grateful to the father for raising “that Metcalf boy”  After all he made them a lot of money.,OzoneLaters,2025-04-19T23:16:16,60
"His dad is the wrong color though, so it wouldn’t work out in this case. Leftists only choose that hill to die on provided the “victim” is of color.",Manburpigg,2025-04-20T08:38:20,47
The only thoughts and prayers that family cares about are $$$. Disgusting behavior,BONER__COKE,2025-04-20T04:56:47,66
Atleast he left peacefully when asked. Something Karmelo couldn't do,MoisterOyster19,2025-04-20T01:45:20,81
This dad is alot nicer than I am because I wouldn't forgive anyone for killing my kid,Electrical_Iron_1161,2025-04-20T00:26:46,94
"Our side keeps acting like it's the first act of hostility we've seen in our entire lives, when the other side has been frothing at the mouth and screaming at max volume since 2014 without taking a breather. Anyone else remember firey but mostly peaceful? *Every* time the MSM found another person harmed by the police (even while charging the police, even with a weapon) there would be another riot.  I think too many people are still watching TV, and taking TV's word for it when they act like the situation is something completely different.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-20T02:08:13,31
He doesn't need to stay home but you are right he is too naive. He reminds me of the left with their immigration views.,kaytin911,2025-04-20T06:45:50,34
He probably will. Look at how devout the left is for immigration. It's the same self flagellating attitude.,kaytin911,2025-04-20T06:47:35,14
Metcalf probably donated to the GiveSendGo.,xterraadam,2025-04-20T09:21:02,9
It's hard to believe they raised a murderer.,lankyevilme,2025-04-20T05:57:51,38
It's the same attitude that plagues immigration enforcement.,kaytin911,2025-04-20T06:44:13,11
He needs to stay home so he doesn’t do anything crazy,CalmHabit3,2025-04-20T09:39:34,8
