"People really voted for a convicted criminal, rapist, friend of Jeffrey Epstein, a man who wanted to execute the Central Park Five, a man who wanted to nuke a hurricane, a man who said he ""met with the President of the Virgin Islands,"" someone that drew on a weather map with a sharpie after he was wrong about the path of a hurricane, someone who's first military raid he ordered cost the life of an eight year old girl and a Navy Seal, someone that said Haitians were eating people's pets, and a bunch of other things.  It's mind blowing there are millions of people dumb enough to support Donald Trump. Honestly, I think a lot of these people like the fact that Trump is a racist, sexist, rapist, criminal, and a bigot in every way imaginable. Personally, I don't believe these people when they say they voted for Trump because of the economy. Economist after economist came out against Trump and anyone with even the slightest knowledge of economics knew Trump would be a disaster. They voted for him just for his bigotry in my opinion.",diamontecays,2025-04-15T18:31:05,340
All the Trump people I know really well it's always been all about the racism.   They are all in on that.  That's why I find black MAGA so damn confusing.   How do they not see it?,gallan1,2025-04-15T18:54:24,102

"I understand that this is a call to action, a ""PAY ATTENTION"", but it's also important to remember that-- No. It took a lot longer than 100 days. It took about 50 years (that we know of) and the perfect storm.  The Heritage Foundation has been moving pieces bit by bit for a long time. They found a party and a candidate they could hitch a wagon to, and they ran with it at the first chance they got. And even if you don't want to dig deep into that, a lot of this framework was set up during Trump's first four year term. \*cough\* SCOTUS \*cough\*  This wasn't a 3-month endeavor. Things have been happening for much longer.",IslandFearless2925,2025-04-15T21:30:40,69

It’s not stunning at all.  They literally had a published plan on what they were going to do combined with a felon candidate saying what he would do on day one.

You’re giving them too much credit. They could never comprehend what an economist says. They just looked at the economy the first couple years during his first term and said yeah we want that.

It’s actually not that surprising when we analyze the American electorate’s history of prejudice. 45 people have served as president and 44 of them were white men. America has a serious problem with choosing one demographic over others despite their shortcomings. The standard for Trump was incredibly low & he leveraged the bias of the electorate to elevate himself. ,Userchickensoup,2025-04-15T19:00:28,43

"Kinda, yes.  Even Dems questioned if Obama was electable.  But he won.  Twice.  Honestly, electing Obama is what allowed a serious campaign by a Conservative with a woman on the ticket as VP, by a woman, and then eventually another woman, an old socialist, another old dude, and a businessman.  Trump may tick off boxes, but not all of them.  He is a businessman first, second, and last.  He won the first time with having zero political experience and the second time with also having little experience.  He is an outsider, despite his demographic.  Obama changed the face of the Presidency forever.  The likelihood of a woman POTUS over the next ten years is pretty high and Harris stands a solid chance of winning in 2028 followed by AOC and maybe even Buttigieg, but I will concede that we may not be ready yet to have a gay man as POTUS, but don't underestimate the electability of Harris or AOC.
