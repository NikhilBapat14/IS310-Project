"So for starters, a large portion of federal politicians are already well off.  https://www.opensecrets.org/personal-finances  So an important note is that many of these people are independently well off, so they don't NEED to work any sort of traditional job to get by.   But what they do when not in office depends on their personal goals. If someone is done with politics, they'll likely spend their time doing charity work, working for boards of initiatives they support, give speeches and write books, and help their party fundraiser and campaign if requested. This is what Obama is doing, and what Biden will do.  If they aren't in office but want to stay in politics, they need to do things that keep them in the public eye. So doing things like staying actively involved in state and federal political parties, writing books and giving speeches, fundraising, and continuing to make connections in the party to Garner support.",ProLifePanda,2025-01-12T15:39:36,1
