"The markets dislike uncertainty.  Having a large undocumented population creates uncertainty.     Furthermore, as detailed in this year's Nobel Prize in Economics winner's work, economies gain when there are clear and consistently applied rules and very inclusive institutions: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Nations_Fail  Based on their theories which are consistent with available historical evidence would indicate that a mass Amnesty would be substantially positive for the US economy.    This is easy to see as a common sense analogy.  If you imagine two schools that play baseball against each other.  School A only allows players to participate in baseball who have a last name beginning with a Letter A through M.   School B allows any student to play baseball.  You would expect School B to have a significant advantage over the long run in head to head matchups.    Unlocking the economic growth from people who are currently heavily restricted in how they can participate in the economy would be good.  There would be some losers, as in the Analogy above where Joe Zooter is a better player than Tim Alexander, but on the whole it would be a significant gain.",tag8833,2025-04-19T20:38:31,23

"Right now, into the foreseeable future, we have a worker shortage. The ONLY way to fix it is more people! There  are not enough young adults coming out of high school to fill the void. A mass amnesty program with certain requirements would solve this problem.  Also, I personally don't understand why this is such a big deal.

And those taxes fund Americans’ social security/ medicare but undocumented people cannot benefit from it themselves. So, what will happen if they get their pieces of the pie?

The message would be, even if you come here illegally, it will be no different from other people coming here legally because you will be given amnesty eventually.

I won't nor should it happen.  The problem with mass amnesties is in 30 years it will happen again and again.  No one thing Trump has correct is the need to deport those who are not here for legitimate reasons.  And no a country high in crime is not a legitimate reason.  They are all entitled to hearings etc to hear them out.  But that doesn't change the situation.    If you want to expand visa allowances I am all for it.  If you want to make immigration easier I am fine with that.  But they go to the line and join everyone else.

Amnesty is the cheapest and most economically friendly option. There's no argument against that.   Most immigrants work. Most immigrants don't commit violent crimes. Most immigrants pay taxes.   Amnesty increases the tax base and the available labor force.   The only reason to not do it is 'bu-bu-but they're brown and they broke the rules! :(',Conscious_Raisin_436,2025-04-22T15:38:02,1

It will increase the size of our government and make jobs, but the people paying is our already burdened middle-class.   What we get out of the deal is less overall than we get.   We need to get middle-class Americans to make babies.

"> The markets dislike uncertainty.  On the same note, amnesty programs also bring with it a level of uncertainty. What is the core and consistent reason for an amnesty? When labor shortage reaches a certain threshold? When undocumented immigrants population, who are productive individuals in our society, reach a certain threshold?

"More specifically, the 1986 amnesty was part of a compromise that was supposed to trade amnesty for current illegal immigrants, with stricter controls to discourage future illegal immigrants. However, the stricter controls basically failed to materialize, and shortly after the amnesty there were some court decisions that mandated that illegal immigrants receive certain kinds of government benefits (schooling for their kids was a big one).  Essentially, it poisoned the well for future amnesty deals; the Republicans have a (well-founded) perception that the Democrats will promise restrictions on illegal immigration and then fail to enforce them.",Avatar_exADV,2025-04-20T10:12:55,4

"Yes, undocumented people still pay federal taxes since those are deducted from your paycheck. At the moment, due to their undocumented status they are taken advantage of by their employers since there are few who are willing to hire them so they'll take what they can get.
