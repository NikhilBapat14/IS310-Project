Good. Now they need to be watched closely for actual follow through. We don't need them making announcements and then trying to wait a term limited President out,cathbadh,2025-04-15T13:27:50,34
Good.  I switched to a Honda after I got pissed that my Range Rover's engine literally blew up at 75k miles.,bw2082,2025-04-15T12:43:10,22
> Honda plans to boost its production in the US by up to 30% over the next two-to-three years  But I was told by the manufacturing experts on Reddit that it takes ten years to scale production? I’m so confused.,dunkeater,2025-04-15T13:08:42,17
One of the tariff objectives. Bring higher paid manufacturing jobs to the US.,Lifeisagreatteacher,2025-04-15T16:25:25,6
Our 2015 Honda had a transmission and engine that was built here in the us.,Narrow-Trash-8839,2025-04-15T16:15:56,1
They’ll be paying tariffs the entire time if they try that.  Keep in mind these announcements are largely aimed at their own shareholders to assure them that the company is going to adapt to the market.,dunkeater,2025-04-15T13:54:11,14

"theyre gonna need more robot arms   and that same automation services contractor will be 30% busier   I wanna see how this translates to jobs, and not just tariff dodging",Baptism-Of-Fire,2025-04-15T14:03:42,26
"Actually building a factory is time consuming and expensive.  Being in the process to build one is something that can be strung along forever.  I think back to Carrier's big promises of jobs or (I think, but am not sure?) Foxconn too.  I sincerely hope they follow through.  I just remain skeptical of everyone making promises that will cost them a lot of money.",cathbadh,2025-04-15T14:42:00,11

"Unless you think factories will be built, maintained, and run by magic pixie dust, you should know how that translates to jobs.",dunkeater,2025-04-15T16:37:09,6
"Extending the process out is expensive as well. Companies will follow through if it’s actually profitable to do so. With tariffs, it is.",dunkeater,2025-04-15T16:38:29,0
"True.  I'd expect them to extend through the midterms and see if the Democrats take Congress or not.  If not, they may have to move forward building here.  That'll give the White House a chance to decide what they really want to do with tariffs.",cathbadh,2025-04-15T16:46:14,0
