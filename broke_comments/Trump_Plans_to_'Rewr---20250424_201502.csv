I fucking knew this would happen.   Fascists don‚Äôt leave willingly. Certainly not over a piece of paper or a vote.   This is why 2024 mattered so goddamn much.,StronglyHeldOpinions,2025-04-24T20:46:28,1

This is why he should never have been allowed to be sworn in. He is a traitor who orchestrated an insurrection. His presidency is unconstitutional. It is illegal for him to hold office. He needs to be impeached.,E1M1_DOOM,2025-04-24T21:01:52,1

However, I truly believe, with solemn consideration prior to reading this headline, this will be the end of America.  Not as we know it but, simply, the end.  America is a massively fucked up place that has great potential.  If a man were to make himself the boyking, that's the ballgame.",SegaSaturnRepoMan,2025-04-24T20:55:38,1

"I couldn't vote until 2016 but it seems like every election since then *has* been progressively more important? Because that's how ...time works? Climate change doesn't pause when a Democrat is in office. Wars and genocides don't either. So I'm a bit confused by this ""they aren't all important"".

Obviously this term is the one we're suffering the most consequences from (if only *anyone* would have warned us) but pinpointing the exact term was the most consequential when we're less than a decade out from the clown show starting is something for a historian to do.
