"Every Senator should be trying to figure out which residents in their state have been sent to CECOT and start working the same angles as Van Holland. Demand meetings with them, go down there and fish them out. Keep the spotlight on this place the American people may turn a blind to it but they will never support what‚Äôs happening.  So don‚Äôt let them turn a blind eye to it.",Pearberr,2025-04-18T16:55:02,436

"Fucking thank you Van Holland for actually doing something outside of lecturing how Trumps orders are illegal or what the founding fathers intended when they wrote the Constitution. There is still far to go, but at least it's progress.  Now, the rest of the Democrats need to get ready rub Trumps nose in this and call him a weak negotiator if/when Garcia gets back to the US.",MARIOpronoucedMA-RJO,2025-04-18T16:52:03,199
">President Donald Trump, during a news conference at the White House on Friday: ""You're talking about Abrego Garcia‚Äîhe is an illegal alien, MS-13 gang member, and foreign terrorist. This comes from the State Department and very legitimate sources, **I assume. I'm just giving you what they handed to me, but this is supposed to be certified stuff.""**  Trump is distancing himself from this.",pacexmaker,2025-04-18T17:03:58,78

I'm sure the leadership in El Salvador understands Trump will be only around a few years and the Democrats could likely be in power next. It's not in their best interest to make permanent mistakes with the USA.,beekeeper1981,2025-04-18T17:19:18,26
