">denial of the notice and opt-outs **violated their right to exercise their religion freely** under the First Amendment **because it overrode their freedom to direct the religious upbringing of their children**  There’s some mental gymnastics here. There are no parents' rights to direct the upbringing of their children in the Constitution, and certainly, children have the right to exercise their religion freely, absent a parents’ decision on the matter.",BigDaddyBain,2025-04-22T09:00:34,3
"Here's a novel idea. Have they thought about sending their child to one of those private religious schools to live in their safe bubbles until they become of age to go to the ""woke"" universities instead of banning books in public ones?",Financial-Special766,2025-04-22T09:20:12,5
"Let them opt-out. That's their right. Then let them figure out what to do with the kid while they are opted out, as is their responsibility.",dark_descendant,2025-04-22T08:54:06,6
"This is stupid is this really the thing we need to be worrying about? Books that show gay people being happy are not a threat to your kids, the MAGA right wing crazies are the ones shooting up schools. It just happened at Florida State University. You don’t stop a fire by throwing away all your furniture, you use a fire extinguisher!",Wonderful-Process-96,2025-04-22T09:17:06,3
"The books in question have nothing to do with religion. If I invent a religion that says the Earth is flat, that doesn't mean my kids get to opt out of science class.",gradientz,2025-04-22T09:06:55,7
">a novel idea  very punny 🤭 but as far as private religious schools and sending their kids goes, I'd guess it's the extremely high costs to attend most of those schools *where the actual indoctrination goes on* that prevent them from enrolling their children. So here we are. As a librarian and ally, I'm tired and this sucks.",Secure_Sprinkles4483,2025-04-22T13:45:12,2
Frankly I’m tired of entitled parents who think they can pick and choose what their kid can learn at a PUBLIC school like they’re ordering from McDonald’s. Why don’t those parents just send their kid to a fundamentalist Christian school on their own dime? Probably because they expect taxpayer funded babysitting.,nosotros_road_sodium,2025-04-22T09:17:28,10
"But science has got it all wrong, Religion  teaches us that man tamed some of the dinosaurs and kept them as pets. (and dishwashers, and record players, and stone quarry cranes, and  ...)",dkorabell,2025-04-22T10:02:14,1
"I’m good with  that, double on the”own dime”. You want out of public school, you get out of public funding.",dark_descendant,2025-04-22T10:22:59,1
