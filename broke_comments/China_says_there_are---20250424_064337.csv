How screwed up is it that I actually believe China over our own government?,Original-Randum-Dude,2025-04-24T07:18:24,29
"So when Idiot Trump proclaims they are negotiating, he is lying as usual. Unless caving in before negotiating is an important part of the Art of the Deal - which he would consider as ""negotiating."".",YallerDawg,2025-04-24T09:10:42,9
Making Trump back down in a humiliating way would hurt Trump without damaging business relations too badly with the US.,clamorous_owle,2025-04-24T07:55:35,4
Trump is so good at negotiating that his strategy is to negotiate with himself and it is resolved before the two parties ever come together,briankerin,2025-04-24T09:34:38,4

China can hold out for more than 4 years if they have to. Trump literally can’t.,thedoogster,2025-04-24T10:21:32,3
You can't negotiate with someone if they don't pick up the phone or even try and communicate with you. What is China supposed to do?,Rosebunse,2025-04-24T09:43:57,2
Trump is lying?  Say it isn't so! /s,juni4ling,2025-04-24T14:29:37,2

"Bahahahahahahaha! Ha! Hahahahahaha!  I’m not a fan of PRC, but damn Trump sucks. ",Tight_Cry_5574,2025-04-24T21:28:38,1
"I think China is making a good faith effort to ally with Canada and the EU to kind of, stick it to Trump. I'm an American, and I hate the thought of it affecting me, but it's almost worth it to put Trump in his place. He was never a good negotiator and an even worse president.",VintageLV,2025-04-24T07:20:37,14
I know!! No likes it when you tell lies about them. Most people learn this at a very young age. You knew yesterday Trump was lying out of his ass. China has no reason to trust him. He really should be told to confess his lies publicly on his knees. And then agree to wear a shock collar so he can be corrected whenever he tells a lie!,Cluefuljewel,2025-04-24T09:16:51,6
"I think he thinks this is negotiating. And normally, he wouldn't be entirely wrong. But the thing is, while letting things simmer and wait is a genuine tactic, it only works if yoy have a point where you will come back to the table. If you hold out too long, it becomes a liability and makes you look lien you aren't taking things seriously.",Rosebunse,2025-04-24T09:46:32,2
So was he lying when he claimed all countries (assuming China as well) were kissing his ass to drop tariffs?,yugnomi,2025-04-24T11:20:39,2
"I guess he doesn't have the cards.  Edit: an absurd comment for anyone not playing poker,  but fitting in this moment.   I'm disgusted by the blatent link of politics to gambling and betting.  We need to get betting and bad money out of politics.  It's infuriating that no one talks about the betting apps and the laws that have been passed to allow monetary gain from political betting.  Again, this is dangerous for our politicians and for our democracy.",joylightribbon,2025-04-24T07:55:07,4
"I expect Xi has also read The Art of the Deal.  Probably in English.   One of the main lessons in The Art of War is, to know your enemy.",Natoochtoniket,2025-04-24T09:20:50,3
I agree. I wish other countries had stood up to him.,itsaquagmire,2025-04-24T11:44:20,6
"In reality, Trump isn’t good for any country that trades internationally. These tariffs just grind everything to a halt, so it’s in every countries best interest to get rid of Trump and everything he stands for",annaleigh13,2025-04-24T11:51:21,4
Love the shock collar!,MelissaMead,2025-04-24T14:43:53,1
This is an accurate take. His historical idea of negotiating is entering into an agreement and then skipping out on the bill by threatening legal action.   This doesn't work with nation states.,socialcommentary2000,2025-04-24T12:10:47,3

"While true, part of the problem here is that he's not even showing up at the restaurant. He's complaining about the food and the conversation without even going to the party",Rosebunse,2025-04-24T12:45:05,1
