">“Suicide prevention is about risk, not identity. Ending the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline’s LGBTQ+ youth specialized services will not just strip away access from millions of LGBTQ+ kids and teens – it will put their lives at risk,” Trevor Project CEO Jaymes Black said in a statement. “These programs were implemented to address a proven, unprecedented, and ongoing mental health crisis among our nation’s young people with strong bipartisan support in Congress and signed into law by President Trump himself.”  This move right here confirms that Republicans would rather have dead kids than queer kids.  And yet, when we bring this fact up, we keep getting told that ""it's not a genocide"".",southpawFA,2025-04-22T15:54:13,19
Regardless of your opinion on homosexuality. This is extremely irresponsible. “People kill people” not “guns kill people”…”we need to focus more on mental health treatment”. Is the hypocrisy not glaring?,Specific_Ad_6046,2025-04-22T16:18:26,4

"Entirely predictable.  As with everything in this Trump administration, the policy is cruelty towards others.",sniffstink1,2025-04-22T15:58:36,3

Use the regular suicide hotline?  Is it different ?,Robot_Alchemist,2025-04-22T16:40:39,-5
"Anyone contemplating suicide is looking for someone who actually understands what mentality they are coming from and needing that person to help defuse it. If staffers can't relate to LGBTQ, domestic violence, mental health issues, or any number of things, they are only selling a suicide. What's already very sad about these hotlines? Most have an automated response that doesn't help anyone in an actual crisis. Talking to a real person is almost as bad as trying to get to any credit card or phone company to solve your bill.",TheRabidGoose,2025-04-22T22:09:51,3

"They'd also rather have dead or permanantly physically debilitated kids over autistic kids. And they'd rather have kids with lifelong PTSD and unshakeable self-hatred than have gay kids.  Conservatives, for all their anti-abortion bluster, never fail to prove time and again that they absolutely hate children, including their own. Maybe especially their own.",SpoppyIII,2025-04-22T19:23:19,4

I'm so sorry for your loss. I am angry at the fact that this administration wants to see more children commit suicide. Disgusting. My love goes to you.,southpawFA,2025-04-22T22:07:58,3
"Christian nationalists care about kids, so long as that kid's not queer.     Then, they want to take that queer kid and torture him in a conversion therapy camp and then celebrate when they kill themselves.     It's genocide, full stop. There is no ""maybe"" to it. Christian nationalists are trying to kill every LGBTQIA+ person off. It's ridiculous.     And now, you're seeing it with regards to people on the autism spectrum.      Republicans only view people as chattel for their Christian nationalist army, and anyone who doesn't fit into their script is deserving of death to them.",southpawFA,2025-04-22T16:01:53,4
