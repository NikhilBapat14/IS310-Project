"Why is it only inappropriately sexual when romance is LGBTQ+?    (This is rhetorical--the answer is that the right views hetero romance/relationships as the default and are only using this language to demonize the ""other""...that, or they deeply fetishize LGBTQ+ people).    Busybody weirdos.",SaintCaricature,2025-04-22T14:26:32,11

"Does this mean they will also ban rap music next? How come my 4th grader has to listen to lyrics about shooting at people, selling drugs & pimping young girls every time we walk through the parking lot? Other kids have that music blasting from their phones and devices all day.   Why is a book about two moms offensive & creates right wing outrage but lyrics about shooting people & armed robberies don’t even get a second thought? It is because gay men at Pride are less scary to confront than rappers at a hip hop venue?",jl56649,2025-04-22T20:33:46,1
"The objection is not about having the books in the schools.  It is about using them in reading classes for very young students (K through 3 in particular) without providing a way for parents to opt-out their kids.  The parents claim that it teaches stuff that their religion opposes.  Montgomery county could have easily used other books to teach reading and English and prevented the issue.  They could have allowed parents an opt-out if they didn't want to take the easier, more common sense, road of other books.    While I don't care either way what they do,  I do wish that educators would quit playing into MAGA's hand.  There was no need for this.  If the real reason for these books was to teach empathy and tolerance the educators could have just picked other books.  If the real reason was to push an LGBTQ agenda then the parents are getting the proper remedy.  I don't like religion much but I believe that everyone has a right to their beliefs.",Only_Mastodon4098,2025-04-22T14:57:59,-12

"> If the real reason was to push an LGBTQ agenda  The ""LGBTQ agenda"" is to exist. That's it. We just want to be left alone, but Republicans will not stop attacking us.

"Yeah...    I think it's from some unwillingness to treat everyone as equally valid people... Like nobody *genuinely* can be different from them and must be pretending (which they think is perverted). Or heck maybe sometimes they're just angry at anyone else being allowed to authentically express themselves?    I don't know if it matters why. I've just been struggling with constant disappointment in other people supporting this evil nonsense.    But the protests have been encouraging, at least.",SaintCaricature,2025-04-22T15:09:45,3
Almost all Muslims believe homosexuality is haram (a sin).  Should all Muslim parents have their children taken away for child abuse?,kelly1mm,2025-04-22T23:13:40,1
