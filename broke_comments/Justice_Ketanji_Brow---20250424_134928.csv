"Look, I'm not a lawyer, but I'm going to go way out on a limb and suggest that a Supreme Court justice should have some basic grasp of the details being argued in front of them before jumping into the fray. Not Jackson, though. She wasn't aware (or at least pretended she wasn't) that the Montgomery County School District, which is at the center of this argument, requires the books in question to be taught to students.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-24T13:56:12,55

When you factor in the fact that she is basically an unintelligent person who coasted into the Supreme Court off the back of a fake college degree that clearly did not test her…  And the fact that this gap is just filled with left wing ideology…  Feels pretty evil to me.,OzoneLaters,2025-04-24T14:21:43,40
