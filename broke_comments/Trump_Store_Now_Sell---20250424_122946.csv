"They're trying to ""joke"" to desensitize people to it so when it happens they've done all the mental gymnastics to convince their base that this isn't an autocracy.  I work in healthcare data analytics primarily looking at determinants of health for cohorts in the United States.  I know people are worried that he's Rasputin incarnate and that he will somehow outlive us all but statistically this is unlikely. People like to bring up Fred Trump dying at 93, but he was in considerably better health by a longshot than Donnie.  If the right were actually smart they would start positioning a much younger poster boy of terror to take over and campaigning that person now.  I don't mind their doing this, genuinely. It's wasting their ability to position someone else for the role. I was more worried about their latching onto Musk who is legitimately somehow scarier.",ergonomic_logic,2025-04-24T13:36:15,43

"The purpose of chatgpt.   Attempting to run for a third term as president could be seen as betraying a consciousness of guilt depending on the context — especially if the individual is trying to avoid legal accountability or consequences that might follow after leaving office.  Here’s how the argument might go: 	1.	Immunity While in Office: Presidents often enjoy certain legal protections or immunities while in office. If someone aggressively tries to retain power beyond the constitutionally allowed terms, it might signal they’re trying to extend those protections. 	2.	Fear of Prosecution: If there are credible investigations or looming legal issues awaiting a former president, trying to stay in office could be interpreted as a way to avoid prosecution — suggesting they know they’ve done something wrong. 	3.	Deviation from Democratic Norms: Willingly violating constitutional term limits can be read as an act of desperation or fear — not just ambition. That fear might be tied to the consequences of stepping down. 	4.	Public Perception: Even if no charges have been filed, the act of clinging to power in violation of law might lead observers to conclude the leader believes they have something to hide — a sort of “if you’re innocent, why not step down?” reasoning.  Of course, this is largely a matter of inference — it’s not definitive proof of guilt, but a circumstantial sign that might support a larger narrative of wrongdoing.

Water quality to rival the poorest countries. Unemployment levels not seen since the Great Depression.

"Here are the two “legal theories” (and I use hat term loosely) I have seen to make this possible despite the constitution. Both center on the constitution’s prohibition only being on being *elected* president more than two terms rather than *being* president more than two terms.  First would have him run as VP for a president who then steps down This one probably violates constitution’s prohibition on the VP needing to not be ineligible. While the Supreme Court ruled states cannot make the determination on ineligibility based on the insurrection clause, that was only due to the 14th amendment mentioning only Congress could enforce that, as well as determination of insurrection is more nuanced (their reasoning not mine). The 22nd amendment has no congressional oversight provision and is the matter of that Trump has served two terms.  The second would have two other people run for President/VP and then being appointed the speaker of the house of reps, and then the President/VP stepping down. This at least requires they get both the White house and the House majority, which is more difficult.",notbobby125,2025-04-24T17:00:26,1

"Literally everything I’ve read about the passing of the 22nd Amendment was basically that while FDR was a good president, no one was happy he had been in office for so long and that the precedence that Washington had set of doing a maximum of two terms was the way things should be. The idea being that no one should have power for that long, they didn’t want Presidents getting old and dying in office, etc. etc.   Also, while the US didn’t formally enter the war until 1941, WWII was in full swing. In the 1940 election Roosevelt didn’t even openly campaign before the Democratic National Convention, he actually said the delegates should vote for whoever they wanted and he’d only do the job if drafted, but was still picked. And the Republican nominee was a nobody. Even though the US wasn’t technically in the war and Roosevelt was seen as someone who might get us involved, I think that he was also somewhat seen as a wartime president even then where the smooth functioning of government was more important than him breaking the norms and getting a third term.   Then, in the 1944 election, his fourth, he actually was a wartime president because the US has entered the fray. So again it makes sense to keep things as they were, especially as the war was going quite well for the US and Allied forces in 1944 with D-Day and the Liberation of Paris happening in July before the election.   What has Trump done to even justify a third term? If a world war breaks out I can pretty much guarantee that he’s the cause of it and it’s not like the economy is doing so amazing that we can’t even comprehend losing our leadership and changes being made. FDR he is not and that’s even before you consider that even though FDR did great things and is usually considered to be one of our best presidents people quietly admit that it’s not good that he held office for so long.",Ghostwriting_Narwhal,2025-04-24T14:23:51,44

He never really seemed to have a grasp on what was funny and why it was funny. He was always looking at others to validate if it was funny.”  &nbsp;  Trump literally had the writers write his own rebuttal. Whenever Trump received a new draft he would add handwritten edits in black sharpie:   >“I have done this a long time and nobody blacks out punchlines,” said Jesse Joyce, one of the writers. Scrapping punchlines represents “a classic lack of an understanding of how a joke works,” he added.    >Even in a script designed to be self-effacing, Trump couldn’t resist boosting himself. At the conclusion of the rebuttal, in an exaggerated (even by Trumpian standards) riff about how he lives in a “25,000 square-foot penthouse atop my solid-gold space station,” Trump ordered that the square footage be goosed to 50,000. He [also] changed a line that read, “I’m sorry, I must go now and make a million dollars somewhere else,” to a “billion” dollars.",Plenty-Huckleberry94,2025-04-24T14:42:31,80

And you’re in the boat and you have this tremendously powerful battery and the battery is now underwater and there’s a shark that’s approximately 10 yards over there?’”  *He went on a brief tangent about shark attacks before continuing*  >“So I said, so there’s a shark 10 yards away from the boat, 10 yards or here, do I get electrocuted if the boat is sinking?
