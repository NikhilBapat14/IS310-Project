"The party needs an effective leader. This is the reason why Trump rules the GOP. He is the leader of the party, and they will defend him no matter what. The Dems will sell out their leaders and instantly eat themselves, which is why we are partially in the current situation. One of the most important rules.  Another important rule is succession planning and finding new talent. This is something the GOP is failing horribly on. There is no succession and you will see many of the sycophantic behavior stop. This is where the Dems can take advantage. Find talent that is not only good for today, but for the future.",vakr001,2025-04-16T23:02:55,1
