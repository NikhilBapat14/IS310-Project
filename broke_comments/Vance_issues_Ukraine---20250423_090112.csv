">Asked to clarify about whether he meant the US wanted to freeze the territorial lines where they are, Vance said Wednesday, “No, I didn’t say that. What I said is the current line, somewhere close to them is where you’re ultimately, I think, going to draw the new lines in the conflict. Now of course, that means the Ukrainians and the Russians are both going to have to give up some of the territory they currently own. There’s gonna have to be some territorial swaps.”  Huh? Why should Ukraine give up territory? And what territory is russia being asked to give up?",sachiprecious,2025-04-23T09:16:55,8

"It's time for Europe and Ukraine to see the US under the Trump regime for what it is - a non-ally.  They align with Russian interests, if not Russia itself, they are seeking politically acceptable ways to withdraw any support for Ukraine, and will not defend NATO if required.  In fact, they threaten action, including militarily, against a NATO nation with posturing over Greenland.  We may start with a trial separation but the divorce is coming.  And I think the US is going to be asked to leave bases in European countries during this administration.    As an American, we're abandoning allies and disrupting the political order that has largely kept a level of peace in the post-WWI period.  Trump is ending it.  It's embarrassing, wrong, and the risk here is stunning.  But we can also accept the reality and act accordingly.  And hope to exist until sanity can be restored, but even then, the US will no longer be trusted.  For good reason.",CrimsonFeetofKali,2025-04-23T09:15:08,7

"> US Vice President JD Vance threatened to abandon negotiations on Wednesday, telling reporters during a visit to India: “We’ve issued a very explicit proposal to both the Russians and Ukrainians, and it’s time for them to either say yes or for the US to walk away from this process. We’ve engaged in an extraordinary amount of ~~diplomacy~~licking Putin's ass, of on the ground work.”  FTFY  The MAGAstration has left the building.  The MAGAstrait",nwgdad,2025-04-23T10:07:47,2
