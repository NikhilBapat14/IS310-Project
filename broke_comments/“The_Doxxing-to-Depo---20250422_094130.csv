They’re snatching ppl off the streets & still the cult cheers. What will it take? When they come for your guns it’s going to be too late. They always come for the guns. You think that 2nd is going to protect you? They’re wiping their asses with the other parts.,ShinePretend3772,2025-04-22T09:50:10,8
AIPAC wants this. AIPAC controls both parties. Any political future for America must not include AIPAC.,hereforthepeens,2025-04-22T10:18:16,3
"The problem with conservatives is that unless it directly affects them, they will happily bury their head in the sand, parrot Fox News talking points, or simply hand wave and excuse it away.  The issue with this is the same that always happens in fascist regimes coming into power and cementing that:  Eventually they do come for you.  At that time, you’re fucked because any opposition has been destroyed.    These people continue to allow fascism unchecked and this will bite them in the ass eventually.  By then, it will be too late.  We are not Germany, Italy, or Hungary.  We have far too much military to be saved from other nations.  It’s on Americans to rise up and take back the country from the fascists.  To date, it has been a paltry effort.",teamdiabetes11,2025-04-22T09:56:40,3
"Yep. All the big talk about needing guns to resist tyranny means precisely nothing if you're incapable of acknowledging the tyranny happening in front of you.   They cheer when the administration talks about making the destruction of a fucking Tesla an act of terrorism, and yet are totally incapable of following the path where that (specious) legal argument leads. The minute anyone - MAGA or otherwise - turns a gun towards the government, the full weight of fascism will fall. 2A as it's understood now will be done with.   Make no mistake, when it's time, they will come for our guns, and once that time comes there will be no stopping it.",FredUpWithIt,2025-04-22T11:24:24,2
& they’ll willingly give up their guns.,ShinePretend3772,2025-04-22T12:09:43,1
