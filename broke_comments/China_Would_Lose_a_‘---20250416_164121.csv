"“No one wants a ‘trade war’ with China, or for that matter with any nation,” writes Senior Fellow [Victor Davis Hanson](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/victor-davis-hanson). “Nonetheless,” he explains, “China has been waging one for years and is now locked in a tariff recalibration with the Trump administration.” Examining each nation’s chances of “winning” such an economic altercation, Hanson notes that China lacks sufficient domestic oil and gas production to meet its needs; has a more fragile political regime than the United States; lacks durable alliances and partnerships with EU and other Asian nations; and still lags behind the US militarily in several key warfighting areas, like nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers. Hanson argues that the Trump administration should “message strategically” with American allies, by pointing out the history of unfair Chinese trade practices, in order to build international support for corrective trade deals. ",HooverInstitution,2025-04-16T16:41:43,7
