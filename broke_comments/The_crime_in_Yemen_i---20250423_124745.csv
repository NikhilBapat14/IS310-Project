They're both crimes.   But this article does do a good job of highlighting that the strikes themselves were illegal and killed a lot of civilians.,ColeBeasleyMD,2025-04-23T12:51:09,12
"exactly,    bombing a civilian residential building is just being swept aside",Repulsive_Ear_6983,2025-04-23T12:57:57,9
This was absolutely my first thought when I read about the leaks.  The lack of communication security is of course bad but what the discussion reveals is that there was no legitimate reason for the bombings other than a show of force and we feel like it.  It‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt retaliation for any Houthi action.   But I guess when you remove your senior JAGs you don‚Äôt have anyone giving you Law of Armed Conflict advice anymore ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,Competitive_Ad291,2025-04-23T12:52:39,6
"[The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/wsj-israel-provided-intel-for-us-strike-on-houthi-official-mentioned-in-signal-chat/) (3/27/25):  ""Information on US airstrikes leaked by senior US officials in a group chat that accidentally included a journalist was reportedly based on Israeli intelligence drawn from a human source in Yemen, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.""     Israel doesn't care about the deaths of innocents.",MentalTourniquet,2025-04-23T13:35:04,3

"The author's description of Yemen sounds like fan fiction rather than reality. It conveniently skips the rather dire history of South Yemen from 1967 to 1990 by describing it as some utopian Communist society. The non-communist North was more developed and industrialized than the communist South. (although Yemen is still one of the poorest societies in the world) And it skips over the entire portion from 1990 to the Houthi civil war in 2014 (a 24 year period where the socialists/communists were NOT in power) and conveniently starts up with US discussions in 2017 (which were against the Houthis rather than any communist government)   At this point, it would be hard to take this as anything other than Communist propaganda of a history that does not exist.",phiwong,2025-04-23T13:13:37,0
"Certain sides of the political spectrum will only care about one of those crimes though, so I can see how focusing on the leak could be an attempt to ouster Hegseth, which one might naively hope would reduce both crimes being committed‚Ä¶",Belle_Requin,2025-04-23T13:04:32,3
Shhh...we can't have context here. It clouds talking points.,430_Autogyro,2025-04-23T14:07:09,1
"good point especially that ousting Hegseth won't stop trump admin leaks or bombing civilians.  this is a policy of the whole republican admin and to a certain extent the non-partisan government itself e.g. military, not just hegseth",PM_ME_DPRK_CANDIDS,2025-04-23T13:05:57,2
