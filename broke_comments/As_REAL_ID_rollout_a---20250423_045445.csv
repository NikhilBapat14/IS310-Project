"The law was passed in 2005, 20 years ago.  I think everyone has had plenty of time to say what they wanted to say.    I’m not sure how I feel about it, but my family has passports, social security numbers, and I’m certain I have an fbi file from past clearance applications.",j3remy2007,2025-04-23T06:13:21,28
I’m confused. I’ve had a REAL ID driver’s license for years now. It started in my home state over a decade ago. I’ve had that gold star on my license since. Never thought anything of it.  Heck I have TSA PreCheck.   The gov has had all my info for decades.,ITrCool,2025-04-23T07:03:25,17
"To get the star in my state you have to verify identity with a passport or certified birth certificate, a Social Security card, and 2 proofs of residency.  What's the big deal?

I've had it for several years now, no big deal.",social_dinosaur,2025-04-23T07:46:05,23

"Yeah all it does in ensure all states are following federal standards on IDs that will be valid for flying.   I mean I'm all for it.   Honestly I'd rather go back to pre-9/11, but if we're here, let's be consistent about it.",dotbat,2025-04-23T08:29:32,9
