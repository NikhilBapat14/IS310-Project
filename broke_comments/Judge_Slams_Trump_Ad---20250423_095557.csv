"***From Rolling Stone’s Nikki McCann Ramirez:***  The judge overseeing the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man wrongfully deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador, has accused the Trump administration of engaging in “a willful and bad faith refusal” to comply with court orders and discovery obligations related to the case.  In a scathing court order issued Tuesday, Maryland District Court Judge Paula Xinis took a torch to the Trump administration’s continued efforts to keep Abrego Garcia imprisoned in El Salvador, despite having no criminal record and an order barring his deportation to his country of origin because of threats to his life and safety. The judge wrote in a scathing eight-page order that the administration has repeatedly “failed to respond in good faith, and their refusal to do so can only be viewed as willful and intentional noncompliance.”  Read more: [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/judge-slams-trump-admin-abrego-garcia-court-order-1235323252/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/judge-slams-trump-admin-abrego-garcia-court-order-1235323252/)",rollingstone,2025-04-23T10:04:22,126

"This guy will be sent back to the US.  They are already paving the way for it, with their so-called diplomatic talks and transferring him to another prison.  Trump's people will want to avoid a showdown over him that could result in contempt rulings, sanctions and the like going against them.    That doesn't mean that Trump's efforts to dismantle due process will end.  But Abrego Garcia has become too much of a political hot potato.  Van Hollen did the smart thing by going there alone and turning himself doing battle with the system into the news story.  (Dems: When you want to whine about the media, take notes from this.)  The logical next step is to identify another prisoner who could be sympathetic, then have the Democratic House member closest to his district go there with a battery of attorneys, some human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and someone from the UN.  Bring negative media attention and place broader pressure on El Salvador to stop cooperating with Trump so that the Bukele government finds an excuse to make the whole thing go away.",I405CA,2025-04-23T10:13:18,17
