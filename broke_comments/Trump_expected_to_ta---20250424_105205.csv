More stuff straight from the authoritarian playbook. An attack on the most centralized means of funding progressive causes and candidates is a major step in their goal of squashing opposition before it even happens.,ahdidi413,2025-04-24T11:04:24,48

"Republicans stack the supreme Court to ensure money will take over our politics, then when the grassroots respond by donating our hard earned dollars to give our candidates a fighting chance, Republicans try to take that ability away.

"Trump said you’d only have to vote once more—and now that he’s back in office, he’s making sure that was no joke. Four more years of targeting anyone who blinks out of line… and maybe no more voting at all.",CheetahPatient6926,2025-04-24T10:56:19,7
"This is horrifying from the perspective of coming after the opposition party’s fundraising.  HOWEVER, ActBlue is a massive, fraudulent, mismanaged scam. It exists purely to sell your contact information. ActBlue refuses to delete your information when contacted (or claims that it has) and happily continues to sell your information. I wouldn’t touch it with a 10 foot poll if I was a dem politician. I would very happily see ActBlue dismantled in such a way that somehow deletes myself and everyone else’s info.  Edit: apparently people don’t like reading truth that challenges something they assume to be above board! By all means go read any of the recent articles about it.",finallytisdone,2025-04-24T11:30:54,-21
Not even close. ActBlue is literally a scam that was already imploding. Biden should have shut it down.,finallytisdone,2025-04-24T11:34:26,-52
Yea that was my first thought. Will they investigate where his anonymous money for his and Melania's coin comes from? Of course not.  Trumps retribution tour continues.,Mylaptopisburningme,2025-04-24T11:01:06,6

I don't like ActBlue because I'd prefer that if I feel the need to donate to a candidate i do so directly to THAT candidate.   But to call them a scam is some kind of unfounded crap lol,Spam_Hand,2025-04-24T12:38:49,10
I wrote straight up fact.,finallytisdone,2025-04-24T12:00:02,-11
They have imploded due to mismanagement. Most of their key staff has left as a result. They publicly state that they take 3.5% of donations as a service fee. I would be shocked if the true figure is not higher. The entire point of the platform is to sell your contact information. They’re one of the most egregious and notorious sellers of your contact information. There is zero you can do to get them to stop selling your information.  Ergo it’s a big fucking scam parading as a “pillar of the democratic party’s digital ecosystem.” It’s honestly a perfect example of how the party leadership and operations has gotten completely detached from the voter base and quite frankly corrupt.,finallytisdone,2025-04-24T13:08:21,-15

3.5%? That's the exact credit card processing fee the biggest card networks charge. That's not surprising at all.,Individual-Nebula927,2025-04-24T14:38:06,4
Jesus. Every reddit comment needs a source now?  Have you used ActBlue? I’m hardly the first person to be victimized by it and state online that I’ll never use it again. It completely turned me off from the idea of donating to a political campaign.  NYT article:  https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/us/politics/actblue-democrat-fundraising-resignations.html  Blog post that acts like its debunking these claim when in reality it just describe the hellish nightmare that is ActBlue:  https://matthodges.com/posts/2024-08-25-actblue-isnt-selling-your-data/  And then you’re welcome to look into the House investigation yourself.,finallytisdone,2025-04-24T16:44:49,1
"> literally a scam  Provides zero evidence of a scam.  Doesn't even bother to explain what the scam is.  Posts two links, one of which describes inner turmoil (*not* a scam) and a blog post explaining that campaigns - not Act Blue - send spammy messages.  Invites us to ""look into"" one of about a thousand witch hunt investigations into prominent Democrats that Congressional Republicans open *every*. *single*. *session*. that go nowhere, result in no charges, but drive headlines and the GOP outrage machine.  What are you even doing?",Bushels_for_All,2025-04-24T18:44:03,1
