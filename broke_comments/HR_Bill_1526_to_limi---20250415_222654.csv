"My senators have ceded all their powers to the executive. Writing won't change that. In any case, the Congress has little power over the courts.",FrostyAcanthocephala,2025-04-15T23:06:53,6
"The courts are hierarchical in nature and district courts are where the vast majority of cases originate. Doing this would require a change in the fundamental nature of the court system. There would have to be new higher level entry points for lawsuits, and that brings up massive questions of standing. Circuit courts would be overwhelmed.",btribble,2025-04-16T02:06:51,1
It's interesting what their focus is on while other bills stay in limbo. ðŸ˜¡,RedRoom4U,2025-04-16T06:28:05,5
All of these moves they are doing is with the intent of NOT relinquishing power in 2028. They arenâ€™t afraid of the left using these new bills against them  because they are not planning on giving that power back once itâ€™s officially lost for them.,ReturningRelavent,2025-04-16T13:43:01,3
What does the constitution say about Tyrannical governments ?,Onefunkybear,2025-04-19T14:29:13,1
They need to hear from their voters. Especially the ones who havenâ€™t come out of this haze of madness. They are to represent all tops their constituents.  They need MORE calls.,HippyGrrrl,2025-04-16T06:50:49,5
This bill is intended to give *more* power to the executive branch. Not less.,Animats,2025-04-15T23:11:55,8

America is pretty much done. Don't be surprised when Republicans end the filibuster so they can pass this with a simple majority.,Spookyrabbit,2025-04-18T19:49:29,2
"I'm in Montana, my senator is a special kind of stupid. There's really no point since he's just going to laugh it off.   I appreciate the optimism, but he's such a tool it's unreal.",Bottled_Penguin,2025-04-16T11:42:37,2
Whenâ€™s he up for reelection?,HippyGrrrl,2025-04-16T12:39:08,1
I'm in a really red state. So I'm not optimistic about ever getting a democrat into office again. That's why I plan on leaving once I get the money.,Bottled_Penguin,2025-04-16T15:37:43,1
Leaving the state or the country?,Spookyrabbit,2025-04-18T19:51:50,1
The state.,Bottled_Penguin,2025-04-18T20:44:54,1
