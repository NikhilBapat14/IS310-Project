Until Bill Maher actually *does* an interview with Hitler there will be unresolved questions.  I think there *could* be such an interview using actors and knowledgeable script writers.  Most accounts I have seen say Hitler was personable and relatively open in such interviews. And it is clear that they were pure propaganda.  It also makes a good sci-fi plot. Transported back in time to some diplomatic event would you have been willing to assassinate Hitler? Does your answer change depending on whether you can return to the present?,EnvironmentalWin1277,2025-04-24T20:00:56,1

It has been used an idea in many productions. *Twilight Zone* did one and I recall a few other shows that have done it. I find the idea of oneself suddenly put in that situation is a bit of a shock that is uncomfortable. For many reasons.   Thanks for the recommendation I will view if possible.   I'll recommended Black Book (Verhoven) about Dutch resistance in the war. Mostly because the moral quandary's are always present with the best and worst of people. Trust is very difficult.,EnvironmentalWin1277,2025-04-24T22:13:30,1
