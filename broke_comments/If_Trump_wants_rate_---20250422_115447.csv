"According to Project 2025 that is the plan.  >""Free Banking. In free banking, neither interest rates nor the supply of money is controlled by the government. The Federal Reserve is effectively abolished, and the Department of the Treasury largely limits itself to handling the government’s money. Regions of the U.S. actually had a similar system, known as the “Suffolk System,” from 1824 until the 1850s, and it minimized both inflation and economic disruption while allowing lending to flourish.23""",Fardrengi,2025-04-22T11:58:38,8

"This is why he can’t be allowed to fire Powell. If he can fire the chairman, he can fire anyone on the board. If he’s forced to let Powell’s term expire, then he only replaces one fed board member",LilytheFire,2025-04-22T15:42:03,1
He needs to leave the people that actually know how to do what they do alone.,Big_Monkey_77,2025-04-22T17:11:09,1
I’m not sure he even cares much about the rate cuts.  It feels more like he’s looking for a scapegoat to claim it’s something other than his tariffs nuking the economy.   As the numbers crater he’ll keep going on and on about how everything would be perfect if Powell had just cut interest rates.,Dearic75,2025-04-22T12:17:53,11
“Lending to flourish”  To who specifically? Because I promise you the poors and minorities will be getting rejected left and right for loans…probably by design.,throwaway758616516,2025-04-22T12:06:40,9
"The Suffolk system was a simple note clearing device, not intended for insuring against any sort of liability or managing a large scale collapse .   Both the federal reserve and the fdic, and certain parts of the treasury and secret service, exist to secure the dollar and financial systems that everyone depends on",GaimeGuy,2025-04-22T12:17:50,7
