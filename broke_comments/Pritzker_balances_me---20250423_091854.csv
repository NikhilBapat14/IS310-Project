"To Dems who encourage the party to avoid LGBTQ issues: skewing moderate is a losing game. If you haven’t realized this, then you’re unfit for office.

"Excerpt:  *When Gov. J.B. Pritzker tells audiences how he became interested in politics, it often starts with stories about his mother.*  *As a child growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area, Pritzker often shares, he’d attend marches, rallies and protests with his mother in support of abortion, women’s rights and LGBTQ issues.*  *Those experiences, Pritzker says, set the foundation for many of his progressive beliefs.*  *“I’m living proof that introducing your kids to the gay agenda might result in them growing up to be governor,” Pritzker told a crowd at a Human Rights Campaign event in Los Angeles in March.*  *Pritzker has made supporting LGBTQ rights a regular part of his platform as governor, including speaking at dinner events for the HRC and Equality Illinois in recent months.*  *He’s set to speak to the New Hampshire Democratic Party on Sunday — one of the first Democratic presidential primary states.*  ...  *He warned Trump’s executive actions targeting transgender people in the military and in sports could one day lead to orders targeting marriage licenses for same-sex couples.*  *“I won’t let hope be a blindfold, and I won’t continue to advocate that we wage conventional political fights when what we really need is to become street fighters,” Pritzker said in L.A.*",DevinGraysonShirk,2025-04-23T09:20:09,19
"From a recent Politico article   “it was a “mistake” that Kamala Harris’ campaign never came up with an effective answer to Trump’s attacks for her support of transgender rights.”  Asked how he would have responded, Pritzker said:   “First of all, stop picking on the smallest minority of people whose civil rights are just as important as yours. … Trans children are most likely of any group to commit suicide. Why do Republicans have no sympathy for that at all?”  This is how you do it folks.",Jellyandjiggles,2025-04-23T10:38:34,5
"Can't say I'm a fan of him being a billionaire who's starting to entertain a possible Presidential run in 2028.  Kind of sick of the ultra wealthy always being the only choice.  Buuut....gotta give credit where credit due.  Pritzker has been a stalwart progressive governor.  I don't have much, if any, to criticize the job he's done as governor.

LGBTQ+ voters represented 8% (12.4 million) of all voters in 2024 and broke 86% for Harris. That means just over 10 million people who voted for Harris. That's a LOT of voters to lose that they will not make up with moderates.,Penguin_Sushi,2025-04-23T09:53:44,4
"It's frustrating because Dems have hardly even tried to defend LGBT issues at all. They just let the GOP set the narrative, basically said nothing in response, and are now like ""welp time to say nothing even more"" as if it'll stop the GOP from continuing to accuse them of being pro-LGBT anyway. Maybe actually try to advocate and explain instead of giving in at the slightest inconvenience?",Scarlettail,2025-04-23T09:54:19,3

"Democrats need to stop worrying about alienating conservatives. They’ve already tried tailoring to them and we all saw how that worked out. They need to stick by the side of people who actually want to vote for them, the ones whose rights are being whittled away by a conservative, tyrannical government hellbent on causing as much suffering as possible. The only LGBTQ issue here is how much the GOP demonizes the movement, something the Dems should be using as ammunition against the GOP as much as possible instead of making ridiculous compromises.",Narianos,2025-04-23T11:41:55,1

"This is the way. Here are two likely outcomes in my opinion from David Hogg's strategy:  1. Better candidates will unseat incumbent, ineffective sitting Democrats, or  2. Good challengers will lose and may prompt incumbent sitting Democrats to act more effectively for fear of being unseated.  If incumbent politicians are sure they will never be unseated, there is no incentive for them to do a good job or to take any risky positions, and reality today demands that our legislators step up to meet the moment.",DevinGraysonShirk,2025-04-23T09:28:39,7

"I feel like most political strategists live in the 1990s when politics were less insane than today. I feel like there are no moderate voters left, there are mostly only 'non-voters' who need to be 'woken up.' Trump is trying to 'wake up' these non-voters with lies and hatred.

It's a tired strategy that's already been done, with historical examples like the Irish, Black people, Catholics, Asian Americans, Jews, Arab Americans, ""the Gays"", goths, feminists, rock music, whatever.   But for whatever reason, Democratic strategists think we should just leave trans people without any support or defense. We should protect the vulnerable when they're attacked, and also stand for a positive vision, rather than listen to what polls say.

Yall gotta stop thinking about billionaires from working class perspective.  They are not someone with a whole lot of money. Money as a concept that it exists for you no longer applies to them.  They are someone who has amassed immense political power without an election. Their wealth exists based on continuous growth of their assets. That growth must be maintained.  They are not free from the chains of corruption by virtue of their wealth they are literally inseparably tied to corruption.  More wealth to them is not more “useless money” their wealth is directly proportional to their power and they must continue to increase it to maintain that power and influence.,Old-Potential7931,2025-04-23T11:15:00,1

"I like both David Hogg and Pete Buttigieg. David Hogg is not trying to be **the** leader of the Democratic Party, he's trying to inject new life into the party by supporting young candidates in blue districts to primary ineffective incumbent Democrats. I think that's a rational and potentially effective strategy.  Pete Buttigieg is fine. I respect that he has a lot of passion about politics, and he's very smart. I don't think he has the gravitas to ever be elected President unless he learns how to communicate better. I think he would be a very effective policymaker or leader in the Legislative Branch, but it seems like he wants to work in the Executive Branch instead.   As an aside, no offense, I think Pete supporters tend to be out-of-touch politicos who think polling is the most important thing, people like Nate Silver. I'm not sure we should listen to those people IMO.",DevinGraysonShirk,2025-04-23T10:04:02,3
"100% agreed. The facts are simple, we know what the core issues are around gun violence. Its a socio-economic problem and a health epidemic.   It begins with rebuilding low-education, blue collar jobs in cities and in the suburbs/rural areas. Give people who dont want to go to college or cant go, a proper pathway to dignified living.  It then extends to reforming police interactions with their neighborhoods, rebuilding that trust through interaction programs. Restoring, or in most cases building for the first time, public faith in the police and government services in general.  Throwing away our one-size-fits-all education and healthcare approach. It doesnt work, at all. We have the wealth to construct a robust education dept, with class sizes being less than half of what they are. One teacher cannot possible educate 25-30 k-12 students, its absurd. Mental health should be more accessible to everyone, but especially younger kids.  We are a gun-loving country, there are just too many firearms out there and people live in too varied an environment (think manhattan living vs nebraska and everything in between) that you cant wave a magic wand and poof all guns nor the differences in lifestyle.   Its a losing message, and its a cudgel that the right gets to hammer the Democrats or anyone liberal on, _and it fucking works_. Even if you live or die by this issue on the left, you have to realize that its not a winning message, and that there are steps you can take BEFORE trying to enact a gun ban.  Not to mention the fact that this is an enumerated right in the Constitution and damnit do you really think RIGHT NOW is the right time to throw away another right? Arguably the only right that makes the Constitution something more than just a piece of paper.",underhunter,2025-04-23T10:14:12,1
