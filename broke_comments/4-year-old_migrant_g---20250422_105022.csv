The whole situation is cruel. I don't expect the administrative state to make it any less cruel. Most of these kids were sent here by themselves. It was expected the US would take them in. I understand some may have been separated from their parents. But that is just incredibly fucking dumb.  That is a child born in unfortunate circumstances. Whose parents shipped them here with professional human traffickers. They quite possibly crossed a desert to get here. Only to arrive at the front doorstep of a nation who does not want them.  We cannot have children coming here without parents let alone the proper paperwork.,Inferno_Crazy,2025-04-22T17:15:59,3

I finally came to this conclusion:  You can only be cruel to people you have power over.  When you are willfully cruel, that is a how you know you have power.  That's why they revel in it.  The more cruelty they can inflict on people, the more people they control, and that means the more power they have.  This is why, for example,  Trump can ask for Romania to return a shitbag like Andrew Tate, but won't lift a finger to return a wrongfully deported man.  Because it's an opportunity to flex his power, to be cruel, and to show others that he has that power.",No_Pool7028,2025-04-23T00:19:20,1

"You don’t know that the parents (or whichever adult) sent them to the US due to negligence. After all, it’s no secret that there’s a bunch of criminal activity in Central America that would be unsafe for a child to be in.

And, if the parents really don’t care about their children (negligence), then should we really be complicit in getting them back to their parents?  “But they’re still illegal.” Desperate times call for desperate measures, and the US immigration application is rather convoluted and takes time that they may not have. Telling people they can’t come isn’t going to stop desperate people from trying. If you really want to deter people from coming illegally, then you have two options:  1) Make legal application easier to understand and attain; also make them faster for people who really need to get out of their home countries   2) Turn the US into a place worse than their home countries (I suppose this is already underway)   Option one helps people, option two not only not helps migrants but also hurts people here legally  Your initial comment was that at least they’re getting due process; if the children didn’t get due process we’d complain about it. You’re framing it as: either they get due process and no lawyer, or they don’t get due process at all (and still no lawyer).

"Adding this:  ”They’re not our problem to take care of, so why should we bother? If we allow them to stay then it will just encourage more migrations which will use up public resources meant for legal residents and citizens. We will be/we are just being taken advantage of.”  I have a hard time arguing against this thought process. It’s much easier to give to others when you’re not struggling yourself, but the US had been struggling before and is still struggling now, regardless of the overall state of the economy. There is a lot of poverty, unemployment, and homelessness that affects legal residents and citizens, that aren’t being addressed adequately due to an apparent lack of resources— and yet we’re expending resources to take on more people in need, when we can‘t even care for our own?  I am sympathetic to this reasoning, and I know that a Reddit comment isn’t going to change someone’s life philosophy. I will say though that my stance is this: There are options to improve circumstances for legal residents and citizens that does not necessitate deporting people in need; it’s just that the most effective thing (higher taxation on the really rich) is not something that the current government is willing to implement because of lobbying and conflicts of interests. Merely deporting people, no matter how many, isn’t going to improve the lives of those struggling (arguably it will make things worse since the economy will be affected and places with a lot of migrant workers may have to shut down). And theoretically, adequate taxation on the really rich will be more than enough to help people in need, regardless of immigration/citizenship status, so we can afford to be charitable.  I don’t think it’s unfair to raise the taxes on the rich because the money that folks like Bezos and Musk make come from millions upon millions of people making use of their products; giving millions of people better lives would mean they have more disposable income to spend, so a lot more money flows which is a sign of a good economy.",ShadowNacht587,2025-04-22T20:02:13,1
">I imagine it’s possible the parents thought an unaccompanied child would be less likely to be deported than a child with their parent(s).  So you're saying, they thought they could GAME the system by seding their kids ALONE to the USA, and therefore we must, in fact honor their gamble by not deporting these undocumented children. If we did that, what makes you think people won't just continue sending MORE and MORE children alone to the USA? You are rewarding this extremely cruel behaviour. This is the reason migration surged under biden. They kept ""rewarding"" bad behaviour.  >And, if the parents really don’t care about their children (negligence), then should we really be complicit in getting them back to their parents?  Since their parents are NOT american citizens we have no obligation or even authority to intervene in those matters. It would be up to the authorities of their country of origin to determine what to do with these children.  > Desperate times call for desperate measures, and the US immigration application is rather convoluted and takes time that they may not have.   Sure, they will do their best to circumvent the inmigration system. It is on US to do our best to enforce inmigration laws. Uncontrolled inmigration is NOT something that we can afford.  >Make legal application easier to understand and attain; also make them faster for people who really need to get out of their home countries  I would support making applications easier to \_understand\_.

"\> So you're saying, they thought they could GAME the system  I speculated, I don’t think this is the only reason.  As for the rest of your comment, I addressed the last part in a reply to my own comment. To break things down more, immigration advocates and anti-immigration advocates share different philosophies on how to treat others they perceive as “foreign.” Immigration advocates see us as a collective society whose care has no borders, whereas anti-immigration advocates see us as more insulated in our own communities and believe we should prioritize ourselves first.  It doesn’t help though that America has a history of being an immigration country (“bring us your sick, your poor…”) and a lot of folks follow Christianity (a big thing Jesus emphasized is caring for the less fortunate, even if/no matter if they are an outsider), so while you make good points, you’re arguing with people’s consciences here—first thing being that their ancestors or predecessors came here looking for a better country and found it, so there’s a sense of guilt of turning down someone also in that position; second thing is their religion (it‘s not just Christianity that preaches to help the other, and I know not every Christian follows this order from Christ).",ShadowNacht587,2025-04-22T20:54:05,2
