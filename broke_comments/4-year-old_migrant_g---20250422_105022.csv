The whole situation is cruel. I don't expect the administrative state to make it any less cruel. Most of these kids were sent here by themselves. It was expected the US would take them in. I understand some may have been separated from their parents. But that is just incredibly fucking dumb.  That is a child born in unfortunate circumstances. Whose parents shipped them here with professional human traffickers. They quite possibly crossed a desert to get here. Only to arrive at the front doorstep of a nation who does not want them.  We cannot have children coming here without parents let alone the proper paperwork.,Inferno_Crazy,2025-04-22T17:15:59,3

I finally came to this conclusion:  You can only be cruel to people you have power over.  When you are willfully cruel, that is a how you know you have power.  That's why they revel in it.  The more cruelty they can inflict on people, the more people they control, and that means the more power they have.  This is why, for example,  Trump can ask for Romania to return a shitbag like Andrew Tate, but won't lift a finger to return a wrongfully deported man.  Because it's an opportunity to flex his power, to be cruel, and to show others that he has that power.",No_Pool7028,2025-04-23T00:19:20,1

"Adding this:  ‚ÄùThey‚Äôre not our problem to take care of, so why should we bother? If we allow them to stay then it will just encourage more migrations which will use up public resources meant for legal residents and citizens. We will be/we are just being taken advantage of.‚Äù  I have a hard time arguing against this thought process. It‚Äôs much easier to give to others when you‚Äôre not struggling yourself, but the US had been struggling before and is still struggling now, regardless of the overall state of the economy. There is a lot of poverty, unemployment, and homelessness that affects legal residents and citizens, that aren‚Äôt being addressed adequately due to an apparent lack of resources‚Äî and yet we‚Äôre expending resources to take on more people in need, when we can‚Äòt even care for our own?  I am sympathetic to this reasoning, and I know that a Reddit comment isn‚Äôt going to change someone‚Äôs life philosophy. I will say though that my stance is this: There are options to improve circumstances for legal residents and citizens that does not necessitate deporting people in need; it‚Äôs just that the most effective thing (higher taxation on the really rich) is not something that the current government is willing to implement because of lobbying and conflicts of interests. Merely deporting people, no matter how many, isn‚Äôt going to improve the lives of those struggling (arguably it will make things worse since the economy will be affected and places with a lot of migrant workers may have to shut down). And theoretically, adequate taxation on the really rich will be more than enough to help people in need, regardless of immigration/citizenship status, so we can afford to be charitable.  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unfair to raise the taxes on the rich because the money that folks like Bezos and Musk make come from millions upon millions of people making use of their products; giving millions of people better lives would mean they have more disposable income to spend, so a lot more money flows which is a sign of a good economy.",ShadowNacht587,2025-04-22T20:02:13,1
">I imagine it‚Äôs possible the parents thought an unaccompanied child would be less likely to be deported than a child with their parent(s).

If we did that, what makes you think people won't just continue sending MORE and MORE children alone to the USA? You are rewarding this extremely cruel behaviour. This is the reason migration surged under biden. They kept ""rewarding"" bad behaviour.  >And, if the parents really don‚Äôt care about their children (negligence), then should we really be complicit in getting them back to their parents?  Since their parents are NOT american citizens we have no obligation or even authority to intervene in those matters.
