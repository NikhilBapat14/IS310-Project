"There is a lesson to be learned from these past fascists.  They lost public support not because of their contempt for democracy or meanness, but because they were defeated.  Fans of Hitler and Mussolini supported those who they thought were winners, until it was obvious even to their supporters that they were losers.  In contrast, Franco avoided costly foreign wars and was able to retain power until his death.  Long after he was gone, one could find Spaniards who were nostalgic for his authoritarian rule because he didn't have any significant defeats that prevented him from maintaining his cult of personality.  Dems should endeavor to get at least some Trump fans to start seeing him as a loser.  These economic failures and the chaos that he created are the best pathways to getting there.  This myth of his business prowess needs to be torpedoed.  It only takes the loss of a few percent to start flipping seats and weaken him to the point that he can get little done.",I405CA,2025-04-22T10:12:31,66
"Mussolini was fairly successful in that he ruled for 20 years, and he had good results in some things. He had been in power for more than a decade when Hitler turned up and was to become Mussolini’s downfall in a way. For a long time he really disliked Hitler and saw him as a primitive anti-semite without redeeming qualities.  To me Trump reminds more of Idi Amin. Chaotic, illogical, sexist, vulgar, but considered charming by his supporters. And Idi Amin was obsessed with winning in all sports no less than Trump in golf, both frequently cheating to accomplish that.",fabe1haft,2025-04-22T10:31:08,16
"Even though he is trying really hard I really don’t think Trump can consolidate enough power to actually become a dictator.  He obviously has not read Dictatorships for Dummies.  As per, the first step in becoming a Dictator is to make everyone better off. This gives you legitimacy and people (provided they feel their lives are improving) are prepared to give up some freedoms for prosperity.  This is what the Chinese, Kim,  Hitler, Putin, Orban etc. did.  Once you establish legitimacy you start to whittle away at the institutions that keep you in check.  In Trump’s case he has a strong base of about 35% of the people, if it were 70% I would be worried.  So if he wants to pull this off he needs to improve people’s lives and build his base first.  He is going in the wrong direction.  His trade war has the potential to significantly hurt every American.   In addition he is going after the institutions before having the necessary legitimacy to successfully erode them.  I am not sure if it is hubris, not being very smart or impatience but his actions are severely limiting his chances for success.  To review as per Dictatorships for Dummies  Step 1:  Make everyone’s lives better  Step 2:  Use your accomplishments to build your base  Step 3: once you build your base consolidate your power by attacking the institutions that hold you in check  Trump is actually making peoples lives worst while attacking the institutions.

"The first decade he was in power, Mussolini did fairly well.

But he was a self made man, after years of manual labour and work as a school teacher he became a journalist. He worked his way up from nothing and wasn’t stupid.

I will be honest I don’t think he cared that much about Covid either way. Like the way trump talks about the Covid crisis makes me think even when he got covid. He didn’t care. Like he did fast track the vaccine. But that was because it was his job to do it not because he cared. Like the way he would put out both covid misinformation and the also the actual vaccine. Makes he think he legit didn’t care about Covid as much as everyone else did and used it when it benefitted him. ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-04-22T20:45:59,1

"A bit more nuance is required if you want to get somewhere with this.  The issue is perceived competence.  Democratic messaging inadvertently supports the GOP message that the Republicans are competent, patriotic winners who are aligned with Middle America.  For Dems to win, this needs to change.

"Basically, the PRI in Mexico? They held power like that because they had an economic boom and due to them having a more ideological legacy than a personal legacy. However, after the economy went from growth to absolute catastrophe, their grip on power weakened and now once the dominant power in Mexican politics in the 20th century is now, a party barely struggling to gain a large amount of seats in parliament in the 21st century.  One of the defining hallmarks of Fascism that isn't like a lot of dictatorships is worship of the leader and threats to the 'superior race'. The issue is with trying to implement Fascism in America is that it there is no defined 'superior race' and that definition will include fewer and fewer people(think all Christian groups get along? Get a group of MAGA supporters from all across the nation and ask what the 'correct' form of Christianity and they'll start fighting each other like starving coyotes). And Trump is that leader they have. However, again, he is old and probably close to death's door but also won't allow others to take his place.   Fascism has a harder time instituionalizing itself into society since it often dies with the leader due to that leader being a narcissist who won't give up power and will keep it surrounded by him until he dies and the system collapses. Institutional Dictatorships can only succeed if it's built on IDEOLOGICAL grounds rather than PERSONAL",lemarshby,2025-04-22T13:57:54,3
"Hard to tell. He wouldn’t be as vengeful if he’d won again imo (not saying he should have or that we should capitulate to narcissists) but we’d have bigger issues that wouldn’t have been addressed.   Ukraine would still happen, Gaza would still happen, and we’d still have to deal with post-COVID recovery, all of which would have been hamstrung under another term of his. Ukraine would likely have fallen and that would have sent a message to China that Taiwan is free game. We’d still have to deal with gas prices and inflation going up but there’d be no Biden scapegoat to blame it on. On that end, he might have kept the cabinet he had and there’d at least be some adults in the room willing to keep his horrid impulses in check. Maybe no Elon or doge, not like his companies would’ve been investigated under 47. None of this is touching on whether he’d rig elections for a third term or leave willingly after thoroughly destroying the country financially.   So we’d have huge problems, two major powers rampaging against smaller countries, probably be in as bad a spot as we were in ‘08, financially. Assuming 47 serves a full 8 years and then steps down after kneecapping any possible investigation into him before fucking off to Florida or Russia, it becomes a question of whether or not the spell of MAGA would be broken. Would the base realize he played them? Would they sit in the ashes and consider the job done, becoming inert politically under the belief that 47 fixed all of their imaginary problems? Would there be someone to replace him in his cult of personality or would there then be a massive clapback by Dems?  To TLDR your question, I think it’d be better in some ways and worse in others than right now. It’ll depend on how deep into the shitshow we get this time around.",Spastik2D,2025-04-23T12:47:38,1

"what would you rather me do? you should know by now that objectivity and reason are foreign concepts to modern reactionary 'conservatives' so what do i do about it when rabid bigotry is becoming more and more accepted?  if someone thinks forcing trans people to use bathrooms corresponding to their quote-unquote ""biological gender"" is a measure to protect women, blithely ignoring that trans men, with facial hair and pit stink and the whole testosterone shebang will now have to go in the women's room, i'm not going to just shrug my shoulders and go ""well, people have differences in opinion!"" if someone's response to the tariffs is that they'll be happy to pay more for products made in america, when 6 months ago they said they voted for trump because prices were too high, i'm not going to try to engage in a good-faith discussion about it, because they are \*at best\* too fucking stupid to tell their ass from a hole in the ground! if someone in agreement with this whole deportation charade thinks that non-citizens aren't afforded due process, i'm not going to bother trying to tell them that the government can simply accuse them of being a non-citizen to take their rights away! they don't care!  these people KNOW they're morally bereft. they know it, they love it, and they take utter fucking delight in making meaningless circumlocutory conversation about their own repugnance with the very people they want to make suffer. i'm done engaging with it in any kind of positive way. it's not my goddamn job to shepherd them towards rationality, and even if it was, who the hell would listen to me? a third of this country refused to put a one-millimeter-thick strip of linen over their face even for the health of their neighbors and loved ones because they're so entrenched in their gadsen-flag-persecution-complexes that they'd sooner re-enact ruby ridge than subscribe to any school of thought other than blithe individualistic willful ignorance. fauci, obama, biden, soros, they're STILL the boogeymen in these morons' atrophied skulls when they've WON EVERYTHING.  there is no way to solve this other than mass-scale intolerance of abject stupidity. nothing but overwhelming shame and rejection from society at large will get them to self-reflect in any way, and even then they'll find a way to blame the Libs or the Globalists or the (((Deep State))) or some bullshit before they ever think that their overwhelming cynicism and paranoia is part of the problem. coddling them is pointless, dialectical discussion with them is pointless, facts and reality are pointless. trump can go on TV and say egg prices are down 97% and gas is under $2/gal and hordes of morons will raise their fists and cheer even after running errands that fucking day for a $7 dozen and a $3.67/gal fillup.  i'm not wasting another iota of energy trying to convince them. let them lose their retirement savings, let their unions get busted, let their jobs dry up, let them starve when their food stamps get cut, and let them choke on their own fluids when medicaid gets sunk like the fucking bismarck. there's no other course of action. let them live with their own choices, but far the fuck away from anyone with grey matter in their heads.",LITTLE-GUNTER,2025-04-23T03:00:27,1
">she's thrilled about the public transport.  Yeah, it's a load off not having to drive for sure.  Chinatown is nice for a short stay, hotels and food are cheaper. I love it there. I'd love to check out more stuff soon, it may be in the cards this fall maybe.",moldivore,2025-04-22T23:40:33,1

"Cool, then enjoy not getting enough support to enact jack shit. We're practically being handed the midterms on a silver platter at this rate, but people like you will find a way to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.  Sit it out then, the rest of us who are *actually* pissed off enough to do what needs done will keep working on trying to get it done without you.",Raus-Pazazu,2025-04-23T09:06:17,2

Nah fuck the redcoats. They need to know it's not okay to be the way they are. They need to know they're at fault. They are the other and they are the ones that don't belong. Fuck them this isn't gonna be at the ballot box anyway this will happen in the streets. Law is done in the USA.,moldivore,2025-04-22T16:19:04,2

So you want to punish them by helping them to win elections.  Increasing turnout on the Dem / Dem-leaning independent side by a couple of points and reducing turnout on the other side by a couple of points can flip the White House and House of Representatives.  Play the long game.,I405CA,2025-04-22T16:22:16,1
