"ah but china holds some important cards. rare minerals, pharmacuetical ingredients and so forth  my impression is we heavily rely on china for supplies in the medical and technology sectors",SerendipitySue,2025-04-14T23:40:39,288
who will win the trade war is debatable. Nobody knows what move China will make because China has not shown its cards. So I would not arrogantly declare ourselves victor yet.,octaviobonds,2025-04-14T23:44:32,213
"China's ambition is to become a monopolistic industrial power : to be the only one to produce certain things and to use that as a leverage of power.  Don't wanna abide ? No drug for your hospitals ! No food for your population !  The way China does this is to support production by all means despite the rules of WTO. Massive subvention, controlled and low interest loans, tax exemption.   That's also why Chinese products are always cheaper. They don't care about making money, they care about bankrupting all competition to create that dependance.",Juract,2025-04-15T04:19:37,50
China makes 5 times more money selling to the U.S. than we do selling to them.   It takes unbelievable levels of willful ignorance and hatred of America to ignore who has leverage here.,dunkeater,2025-04-14T20:14:34,211
Not sure I’d trust my economic news from “AMGreatness.com”  I don’t think they’ll lose that bad . They’re beating us in several tech sectors and I’m more upset about that,djc_tech,2025-04-15T07:22:30,17
Someone who understands Chinese culture please enlighten me with a possible off-ramp out of this situation. Continuing this way is a bad option for them. Their ego is writing checks their economy cannot cash.,rdenghel,2025-04-14T19:26:37,5
Better cut that cord and break the habit now than in a hot war over Taiwan. ,beamerbeliever,2025-04-15T08:53:59,10
"They have that, and trump and the US military is aware, if china invades taiwan, most of the worlds chips are made there and china could throw the world into chaos by destroying the production the world needs",Xander_hades_,2025-04-15T00:09:21,70
"Yes, but over time, we can pick up manufacturing in country, and can find raw materials elsewhere. Short term pain for a long term gain.",MadGobot,2025-04-15T07:21:55,-3
You certainly shouldn’t make any predictions based on this article. Victor Davis Hanson is an excellent military historian but he’s not an economist.,zip117,2025-04-15T02:40:39,34
China's hosed as we can do without plastic crap but their factories can't do without buyers of plastic crap.  A prolonged trade war will shutter their factories and cause massive unemployment.,ChristopherRoberto,2025-04-15T03:46:50,-28
"This seems to have always been the plan. They're communists at heart. Even when things were going well they were still using currency manipulation to artificially lower the price of their goods in contravention of WTO rules.      Bill Clinton really fucked us all over by selling American manufacturing on a silver platter to China, Mexico and Canada in the 90s.",AldrichOfAlbion,2025-04-15T07:01:46,11
"The U.S. has plenty of leverage but a trade war, like any war, has casualties.  China is a communist dictatorship and can inflict limitless pain on its citizenry without political consequence.  If a trade war pushes the U.S. economy into a recession or results in stagflation, the citizenry will want political heads to roll.",SeemoarAlpha,2025-04-14T21:11:38,432
Trump:  I hold all the cards.  Jinping:  The cards are made in China.,Ironman650,2025-04-14T22:55:27,78
Well China did just attack our financial system with their sale of US Bonds. So they have that going for them.,REDthunderBOAR,2025-04-14T21:05:58,39
Reddit has a massive hate boner for America.  It’s obnoxious. ,Infyx,2025-04-15T07:04:28,4
"They're kind of backed into a corner.  They could try to liberalize their culture and economy but that would almost certainly result in the downfall of the CCP.  The most likely situation is a mutual de escalation of the trade war, Alternatively they either threaten to or actually blockade Taiwan either as a negotiation tactic or actually start a war with the hope of flipping the table, so to speak.",hiricinee,2025-04-14T20:02:33,54
"Chinese exports to the US make up 2.5% of their entire income. This hurts them, but collapse scenarios are really far fetched. The entire tariff charade is all just business as usual and Trump knows this. They are businessmen, with business tactics, which are renegotiating a contract that benefit one side too much. Just let it play out.",WillGibsFan,2025-04-15T04:33:39,10
"They stop manipulating currency, they stop with the financial system trickery, they let us companies sell there unhindered, they drop all us tariffs, and they stop threatening taiwan",Xander_hades_,2025-04-15T16:31:37,2
"Not sure why you’re downvoted. We are on the verge of fixing this issue by building non-TSMC fabs, but it‘s not there yet, especially for extremely small NM cores.",WillGibsFan,2025-04-15T04:30:30,47
"imagine a year to 3 years  years to get the facilities built for pharmaueticals. the manufacturing equipment likely comes from china. so that is out. some other source if there is one needs to be found,,.   some of the raw materials come from china so that is out.  Other countries such as india make them but i read they get raw materials from china  Now imagine a year or two without drugs. Millions would die. Drugs are keeping them alive if they have a chronic condition OR if you get an infection, you could die due to less choice of  antibiotic  tubing and other medical supplies come from china too.  In my opinion we royally screwed our national security by allowing almost all drugs to get offshored.",SerendipitySue,2025-04-15T22:42:50,3
"But he is looking at this from the perspective of the DIME model, which is something people with expertise in military science have a great deal of familiarity.  While the focus of the article is on the E, the other national powers are in consideration, as well.  Don't forget this is a bit bigger than simply economics.",Celebril63,2025-04-15T09:12:53,6
"If you think this is just about ""plastic"" you have not thought it through.  China is not hosed just like Russia was never hosed when NATO collectively decided to sanction it to death, because it turns out, Putin was playing 3D chess and outsmarted the West. China, likewise, is not ignorant, it saw this coming, that is why it has been building alternative trade markets (like heavily investing into African and asian infrastructures for trade), and accelerating them. The question is, what is better, to be a major buyer of Chinese plastic cr@pola and with that have some level of control over their market, or to be completely cut-off and lose all geopolitical control?  If we lose geopolitical control, our only way out is through direct war with China.",octaviobonds,2025-04-15T11:28:10,6
I think that’s a calculus that not many people actually consider.  China would gladly sacrifice millions of people if it meant the downfall of the U.S. and the west. They are playing by a different set of rules.,EliteJassassin101,2025-04-14T21:53:17,201
Actually China allowing a middle class to begin to thrive kinda undercuts the effectiveness of their authoritarian nature. They have to keep them propped up at all costs or it can all fall apart.,-DizzyPanda-,2025-04-14T21:20:31,30
Really pragmatic thinking here which no one talks about,One_Fix5763,2025-04-18T23:53:09,2
"That’s a bit over simplified. The U.S. has lost millions of jobs outsourcing to China, the potential gains far outweigh the risks.",dunkeater,2025-04-14T22:02:27,7
"Lmfao whom did they sell them to, and in exchange for what?",Piss_in_my_cunt,2025-04-14T21:50:43,-21
"Thank you for your post.  If they thought they could win a Taiwan war, I think they would’ve started it during the previous administration. A blockade makes more sense, but it’s expensive and I’m not convinced they can afford it. I agree with you that mutual de escalation seems the most likely outcome. 👍",rdenghel,2025-04-14T20:06:52,15
"My theory right now is someone in the government has seen proof they are planning to attack taiwan sooner than we all thought, and this is a shock tactic to try and slow it down",Xander_hades_,2025-04-15T15:04:55,7
"China isn't like Russia, they were culturally deleted and turned into a factory country for foreign powers, and are intensely dependent on foreign money.  Take away foreign money and factories, which we're doing, and they revert to literally eating each other as during Mao.  >The question is, what is better, to be a major buyer of Chinese plastic cr@pola and with that have some level of control over their market, or to be completely cut-off and lose all geopolitical control?  The best option is to cut them off entirely, move businesses to America, prevent them from controlling shipping lanes, and prevent them from controlling land routes to Africa.",ChristopherRoberto,2025-04-15T13:11:20,2
It‘s not a hard point to make. China has done this in the past and the Chinese are *way* more used to taking shit from the government than westerners.,WillGibsFan,2025-04-15T04:31:38,32
"They disappeared Jack Ma, one of the richest people in China, for quite a while to demonstrate the power of the party.  I think they can handle any middle class uprising.",SeemoarAlpha,2025-04-14T21:39:46,82
"The entire point behind chinas authority is that you count less, the more money you have. They regularly disappear billionaires.",WillGibsFan,2025-04-15T04:32:17,0
US treasury bonds basically work like stocks. Anyone can buy and sell them on the open market at face value.,NyJosh,2025-04-14T22:29:15,36
"A blockade only works if other nations follow it.  If the US Navy escorts ships to Taipei harbor? What will the PLA Navy do?  So a blockade-- or disobeying it--can be seen as an act of war, and not just in place of a war",Alas_Babylonz,2025-04-14T23:02:16,5
"Right blockade is risky too, unless they're going to go very soft as a negotiating tactic.",hiricinee,2025-04-14T20:12:39,2

Disappearing one guy is easy. They can't get away with crushing 100 million+ middle class people who actually drive their economy.,-DizzyPanda-,2025-04-14T22:00:08,21
"Yes precisely, so if China sold, someone found them valuable. You can give a shit when no one wants to buy them. Til then, buncha stupid people making noise about things they heard other people say.",Piss_in_my_cunt,2025-04-14T22:37:14,-22
">If the US Navy escorts ships to Taipei harbor?  If it came to this, the PLA Navy would full reverse while their government and our media wage a war of words calling it the US invasion of Taiwan.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-14T23:41:07,1
"They don't have to crush them, their propaganda machines have been turned to level 11 and nationalistic pride is at stake.",SeemoarAlpha,2025-04-14T22:32:03,52
The issue with them selling large numbers is that makes the interest rate on them go higher (which is the interest rate the US government pays bond holders). So the Chinese can screw us by selling some of the $850B in bonds to spike the price to hurt the U.S. economy by forcing the federal government to spend a lot more paying out interest on the $23 Trillion in bonds that are out there.,NyJosh,2025-04-14T22:40:13,43
"Think of it this way, if people were going to buy US Bonds, would they go for the more expensive or cheaper bonds? Cheaper, and that's what China bought and sold.   If people are not buying US Bonds from the US we don't get money for our debt based government.",REDthunderBOAR,2025-04-15T05:36:18,6
"Ok so we pay more in short term interest on variable rate bonds - this literally then reinforces confidence in the dollar, and it definitely doesn’t apply to all bonds, and in the meantime, China is still getting fucked.   Remember, even without our trade terms, they’re in the middle of demographic collapse. One child policy, favoring males, no shit they’re in trouble.   I’m just saying you need to unsuck China’s dick a little bit, ok whoopdie doo they can play some bonds games. Peanuts.",Piss_in_my_cunt,2025-04-14T23:13:29,-28
