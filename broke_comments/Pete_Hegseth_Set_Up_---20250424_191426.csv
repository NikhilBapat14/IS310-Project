I have a hard time not throwing up every time I hear Trump or another administration official say they are getting rid of DEI to promote meritocracy when these are the same people who picked Pete Hegseth to be Secretary of Defense.,OhioValleyCat,2025-04-24T19:29:19,1

Lol! Hegseth knew and deliberately went around security measures to discuss intelligence with others?!  Hegseth deliberately bypassed security measures to discuss sensitive intelligence with others secretly.  That's a he11 of a deal!,5pinktoes,2025-04-24T20:19:09,1

"Quote from ""Parasite"" says it all:   ""Ki-woo, you know what kind of plan never fails? No plan at all. No plan. You know why? If you make a plan, life never works out that way. Look around us, did these people think 'Let's all spend the night in a gym?' But look now, everyone's sleeping on the floor, us included. That's why people shouldn't make plans. With no plan, nothing can go wrong and if something spins out of control, it doesn't matter. Whether you kill someone or betray your country. None of it f***ing matters. Got it?"" ",Potential_Kangaroo69,2025-04-24T19:44:05,1
