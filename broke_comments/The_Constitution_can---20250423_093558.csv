Why is it that a lot of modern conservatism doesn't understand what is actually in the Constitution? The right to due process exists for people to have the opportunity to defend themselves and confront their accuser. The burden is on the State to prove that I am not a United States citizen IN COURT.

"I've got to disagree. I don't trust the government that much.  Without due process, I can just say YOU entered the country illegally. And no due process is owed to illegal entry.  Maybe you'll say ""no I didn't, I'm a citizen and I can prove it.""  I say ""too bad, no due process, you gang member!""",hearing_anon,2025-04-23T09:47:30,2223
"The constitution guarantees due process to anyone arrested on US soil. Many immigrants are caught crossing the border and turned away immediately without due process even if they made it to American soil. It would be stupid to bring all those people before an immigration judge.  But if someone is living in the US and arrested, they should have due process.",USA_Patriot_100,2025-04-23T10:36:07,342
"There’s a difference between denying entry and deporting.  You don’t have a constitutional right to due process for denial of entry.  This is considered an inherent power of a sovereign.

In your example - the 10M could be excluded entry.",goinsouth85,2025-04-23T10:10:04,249

"The only restriction in the constitution is ""without due process of law""   Due process of law is different for different groups. If you are a citizen, due process is a trial with a jury of your peers, etc.   If you are not a citizen, due process *starts* with a verification of your status in the country. If you have a visa, green card, etc then your due process is like that of a citizen. But if you are not here in any legal capacity, you do not have those rights.   So essentially due process for illegal immigrants amounts to verifying their status in this country.

That being said, I think a complete reading with reasonable common sense dictates that a person who enters the country illegally may be removed without due process because that guarantee is tied to a constitutional obligation not to deprive said “person” from “life, liberty, or property” without due process.

"I agree with the thrust of your thought experiment, but would argue a different result. If 10M Chinese landed in Alaska, that would be an invasion and should be treated as such as a military matter to where we are repelling invaders. To that end, the Alien Enemies Act, which has twisted up so many liberal’s knickers, would be immediately enforced and justifiable. No due process afforded and they are likely pushed back in China or into the sea.   Now, the better thought experiment is, what about 5 mil overnight? 1 million? 500,000? What if it’s not overnight but over a longer period? 2 weeks? 2 months? 4 years? Now we are getting into the territory of what Biden and the Democrats unleashed with illegal immigration.

"It's a mess.  I agree.  This isn't the only thing we need, but these two things will go a long way:  1) Secure borders through legislation. Slow it down. This must be done through legislated immigration policy that can't be undone by an EO. That can make it (relatively) durable across leftist rule.  We have a majority in Congress, and currently have an opportunity to pass laws. Trump has been effective at getting the Rs in line - if he focused on getting a bill through.  2) Increase processing speed. More immigration judges, for starters.  It won't happen overnight, but, with a bit more capacity and secure borders, we can make progress.  But here's the thing, if we suspend due process - it circumvents the rule of law. It makes you and me vulnerable to summary deportation. A constitution is a core part of what makes this a country I want to be in.  Im not willing to give my rights up, nor do I trust the government enough to give them the power to execute a sentence without me being able to at least defend myself.  >""due process"" (trials as you see it)  Not how I see it.

">You can contest it subsequently, not at the time. And cops have body cams.  You seem confused. Due process doesn't mean the government can't make an accusation / charge you.

If course, if a cop has a body cam catching you doing something wrong - that's going to be pretty compelling evidence that will likely mean your defense won't work. But you still have the right to try.  For a ""constitutional conservative"", that's kind of a fundamental part of our constitution that you're missing out on.  >you have to trust those that you put in positions of authority  Yeah, that's a big ask.
