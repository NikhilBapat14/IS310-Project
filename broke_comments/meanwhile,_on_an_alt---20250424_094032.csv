"this is from *yesterday*  >Egg prices have spiked over the past year amid a bird flu outbreak. Trump claimed Tuesday that ‚Äúas you know, the cost of eggs has come down like 93, 94% since we took office.‚Äù That is wildly inaccurate.  >A decline of 93% or 94% from the national average consumer cost of a dozen large Grade A eggs in January, about $4.95, would mean that eggs are now costing consumers under 38 cents per dozen. Any grocery shopper can tell you that is nowhere close to true; in March, this national average price hit a record high of about $6.23 per dozen. It‚Äôs very possible the April average is lower ‚Äî the data will be published in May ‚Äî but clearly not nearly as low as Trump said.  https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/23/politics/price-of-eggs-gas",ms_directed,2025-04-24T09:40:44,106
