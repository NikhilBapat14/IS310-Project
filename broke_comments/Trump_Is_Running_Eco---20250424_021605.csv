"But he went to Wharton and he's really, really, really smart. Just ask him. *The Art of the Deal* will be followed by, *The Art of the Grift*. He probably just sees America as another bankrupt business like his others. He won't have to pay back creditors and can retire to Mar-a-Lago without a care in the world.",invalidpassword,2025-04-24T02:42:30,4
"Running everything in reverse? Is that like owning multiple casinos, an airline, a water company, steaks company, a University, and other businesses and having them all go bankrupt?",TopEagle4012,2025-04-24T03:13:29,4
"A great, telling quote that leads to the main point: *Elon Musk shared the same idea on X: “We need to shift people from low to negative productivity jobs in government to high productivity jobs in manufacturing (as well as mining and refining of materials)*   Main point: ""*Think of the plan as a classic economic-development strategy, but run backwards. The typical pattern for economic development involves moving a nation’s economy up the value chain. A poor country develops export markets by specializing in low-wage manufacturing. Eventually, these industries develop higher levels of sophistication, adding more intellectual value—first they build toasters and cameras, then cars, then robots. These industries generate tax revenue that can support better schools and other forms of public investment, feeding back into the developmental cycle...  ...The tariffs, while putatively intended to promote industrialization, have the more direct impact of directing American production back into industrial inputs. Trump has raised tariffs on metals, which makes building things more expensive but creates an incentive to reshore the production of steel and aluminum. This moves the industrial economy down the value chain, rather than up, which makes sense only if the objective is to have an economy with more guys wearing hard hats.   Kind of like an industrial version of Pol Pot's ruralism?",spamattacker,2025-04-24T05:40:43,4
