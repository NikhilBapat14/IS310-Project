Let‚Äôs get a district judge from Florida to put an injunction on this bill.,WranglerVegetable512,2025-04-19T12:00:53,129
"From the verbiage:  ‚ÄúThis bill would¬†also¬†enact the California Individual Assistance Act to establish a grant program to provide financial assistance to local agencies, community-based organizations, and individuals for specified costs related to a disaster, as prescribed. The bill would require the director to allocate from the fund, subject to specified conditions, funds to meet the cost of expenses for those purposes. By authorizing increased expenditure of moneys from a continuously appropriated fund for a new purpose, the bill would make an appropriation.‚Äù  This sounds like another money laundering opportunity for the people who have created and backed this bill.¬†  Becuase my guess is the people authoring this bill already have their hands in creating the local agencies and community based organizations.",Iamstillhere44,2025-04-19T12:50:27,49

"‚ÄúYou are carving out the authority for state funding to go to illegal immigrants,‚Äù said DeMaio. ‚ÄúThe bill would allow the director of emergency services to prioritize funds for people who are not here legally.‚Äù",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-19T12:46:36,14

"Na, the NGOs that they are actually funding will still be there. It‚Äôs about the far left patronage network, not the people. Same as always.",Unlucky-Prize,2025-04-19T14:59:39,1
"This is a lot closer to iNsUrReCtIoN than January 6th was. This is a state (really multiple states) passing state laws that violate federal law, when federal law is the supreme law of the land. Not only is it happening in the realm of immigration, with states harboring aliens, but they also pass laws that violate the Second Amendment. Federal marijuana laws are wantonly violated by many states too. This is the problem that results from so many executive administrations just choosing to ignore laws that they don't want to enforce. It's then an uphill battle for a subsequent administration to actually do their job and enforce all federal laws. If the People want a federal law to go unenforced, Congress has to appeal it or the Supreme Court has to rule it unconstitutional.   States have their own sovereignty, but when their laws conflict with federal laws it's the federal laws that matter. It's the Constitution that matters. The Federal government can't force states to enforce federal law, but they can punish states for violating federal law, such as federal laws against Alien Harboring, which makes it illegal to harbor any alien or entice or encourage any alien to come to or remain in the United States.¬†",Mountain_Man_88,2025-04-19T13:17:47,7

"Let's not be dramatic - bad legislation (effectively,  paperwork) is not even in the same ballpark as breaking down barriers, pushing through doors, and ignoring the directions of LEOs.",Jaegermeiste,2025-04-19T13:47:18,1
Perhaps I am Alan Dershowitz and the mountain man persona is misdirection? ü§î,Mountain_Man_88,2025-04-19T13:42:19,3
"I'm not saying that they're the same, I'm saying that a state passing a law that would have the state government violating federal criminal law is more of an insurrection than random people having a mild riot in/near the Capitol.",Mountain_Man_88,2025-04-19T16:00:14,2
"You mean the same directions by LEOs who waved people into the capitol building on Jan 6th, right?",deeziant,2025-04-19T20:32:19,2
