"There is no way vaccines cause autism. There is also no way autism is 95% genetic, while also maintaining most modern diagnoses are accurate and reliable.   I’m sorry, but it’s become a fucking trend somehow to be autistic for a lot of kids, so I’m not buying this spectrum and high functioning bs, as raising kids with advanced technology can **lead to the same exact symptoms of social dysfunction and underdevelopment**. And why would I trust any American institutions at this point, especially studies from the medical industry, as growth and profit outweigh truth without shame or remorse.  Edit: absolutely lazy work people. No one is going to address how we are pumping all kinds of chemicals into our environment or *how we all contribute to a toxic environment*, which is likely fucking up our children. Nope. Let’s just export this issue to good ol’ nature and biology. This level intellectual dishonesty is truly what we’d expect from the States.",MajorMisanthropic,2025-04-24T08:37:16,-65

"This is an ignorant comment. Autism is indeed a spectrum. If you wanna get real technical there’s different levels to it that range from mild to severe. There are MANY people with mild autism that live successful lives without need help or support. In fact, you’ve probably met someone with high functioning autism but didn’t notice it because they’ve learned how to socialize over the years aka mask. Even people with autism who are more severe can still be relatively successful with the right supports.  Now, why is there more diagnoses happening? Because the world in general is warming up to acknowledging mental health is just as important as physical health, even if you can’t see it. There was people with autism in the 60s, 70s, 80s, etc. but then the way of thinking was to just deal with it as opposed to try to get help and learn about your diagnosis.   Also, before you question my credentials I was an ABA therapist for 5 years and worked with kids who have autism. So I’m very familiar with this topic. Both you and RFK should do some fucking research.",MasterofPandas1,2025-04-24T09:43:15,46
"This comment is exactly the kind of ignorant, unscientific, and fundamentally lazy approach that RFK is taking. ""I know it cause feels"".  Are you an expert on the subject? Have you read any research on it? Not just googling for abstracts that you think validate you or pop news articles about studies, but the actual research?  Have you ever worked with these children directly in a special education context? Have you based your comment on consultation with any doctors in the relevant fields?  The answer is obviously, no. The only effort you put in is vibes. Awful convenient that ""I don't trust any institution"" becomes a shorthand for you to be able to just declare anything to be true and ignore all concrete evidence or even the need to look for any in the first place.",Godphase3,2025-04-24T09:14:38,53

"It’s because it most likely is different conditions   Autism was put on a spectrum because experts were struggling to tell what was going on/IF they were indeed different conditions  So they fused like 12 different conditions   Now, there’s evidence there’s probably at least 2 different conditions   1) de novo is random genetic changes, basically it’s spontaneous DNA/genetic changes that seem to be more severe  2) the “natural” occurring kind that seems to be running through families   And I’m not going to argue that there aren’t environmental factors because there are  Food dyes DO make life harder for autistic people, our foods are processed to hell and probably a lot more environmental issues are probably making symptoms worse  But the goal should be to improve autistic lives and reduce symptoms  There isn’t going to be a “cure” for the type that runs in families, that’s just how we are!  There MIGHT be a possibility of use preventing de novo changes happening, we need to learn more about how and when it happens   Don’t compare us to Tik tok teenagers, we are real people that are dealing with this shit",Lilsammywinchester13,2025-04-24T13:27:18,1

And all the iPad babies that exhibit the same social underdevelopment as autistic children?  Autism exists. Likely caused by the chemicals we eat on a daily basis. One or many combined. We shouldn’t lump “high functioning” autistic people in with barely functioning humans actually struggling with autism.

"Experts are still struggling evidently. It’s likely the chemicals we eat on daily basis finally catching up to the “rational animal”. It’s also a massive over diagnosis phenomenon due to lack of a specific gene or biological qualifier, correct? So there really is no way to tell if it’s an allele or if we are fucking our children up with chemicals/technology, correct? And because it’s the most painful to swallow, it’s like the latter, with no pun intended.  By all means, elaborate on how we know it’s genetic without a gene to point too. Surely chemicals will alter genes, but it might be in such a subtle and minute way that any measurement is negligible, which would be the case with rapid onset chemical changes to genes.",MajorMisanthropic,2025-04-24T14:38:02,-3

"Your classification argument is like saying we shouldn't lump spinal cord injury patients with *incomplete* tetraplegia in with spinal cord injury patients with *complete* tetraplegia. Are there significant differences in their abilities? Absolutely. Does one require *significantly* more resources to accommodate than the other? Also yes.   However, regardless of where someone falls on the spectrum of tetraplegia severity, they're all dealing with a cervical spinal cord injury and will likely benefit from similar treatments and share similar symptoms - that's why they're lumped together. A tetraplegic patient who can walk and live a relatively normal life with little to no assistance still has tetraplegia, even if they don't outwardly *appear* to be disabled at all.",HealthyInPublic,2025-04-24T18:50:37,1
"Since they just added some more petulant responses I glanced at their profile, and they are an open racist/eugenicist from the most cursory glance at their comments:  > MajorMisanthropic: Only in a society of overabundance and extra resources could people absorb an increasing rate of autism.  > It also remains the case that the quality of life for people who can even understand the term “quality of life” inherently decreases when we continue to celebrate deformity, malformations, and degradation of our species  and  > MajorMisanthropic: Most stereotypes about races are fundamental false. That is not the case in the U.S.  >Endless videos as support. Let me know if you need them.  Just some stuff they've said this week.   It's important to combat these people with our responses based in scientific reality, but also to realize that these people want us dead and don't mind talking about it openly. That requires being ready to defend ourselves with decisive kinetic action, because people like that won't respond to any other argument.",Godphase3,2025-04-24T14:59:58,5
"I can’t speak for the “de novo” aka random genetic changes   But for the type that runs in my family?  It’s definitely not chemicals, causing the autism because it’s documented in my family tree how “quirky” we are down the line  But many many members of my family are very successful despite our “quirks”   CEO’s, principals, teachers, professors, directors   Like, I was valedictorian, I just picked a shitty career that was HEAVY in social skills  I will agree overall we need to study it and figure out treatments   My life would be SO much better if there was medicine to make life less…intense   Idk how to explain it, but life feels so easy when I drink lol",Lilsammywinchester13,2025-04-24T14:50:35,2
