"Trump doesn't care if we are completely destroyed. He already made plans for his future. He survived through all his bad business decisions. We have to do what we can to protect ourselves from his disastrous policies.   “Emerging markets face high inflation, debt, and capital flight risks, making devaluation dangerous,” said Wael Makarem, financial markets strategists lead at Exness.   Additionally, devaluation could be seen by the U.S. administration as a trade measure which could attract retaliation, he added""",Lebarican22,2025-04-22T07:13:27,3

"This is about more than just getting the Fed to lower interest rates. There's a whole section in P2025 attacking the Federal Reserve. They're going to gut the Fed. All of them are out there spewing anti-Fed talking points.   At this point, it's a real possibility that they will cause a global financial panic when they do it.",mlawus,2025-04-23T07:26:13,2
"It's clear Trump wants federal funds rate cuts. He wants to pay lower interest on debt. But we're also expecting inflation, which should indicate rate hikes. If Trump gets his rate cuts, we're looking at a situation like Turkey in 2022.   What's worth noting, stocks often go up (in the inflating currency) as inflation hits, since stocks represent real assets. Eg the BIST 100 went up dramatically in Turkish lira. However the real economy falls apart. I suspect Trump would be okay with ""record stock prices"" as inflation hits record levels.",hansn,2025-04-22T12:22:44,1
"More importantly, Capitol Hill Republicans are letting Trump destroy the economy and weaken our national defense. They are like parents letting a toddler play with matches at an oil storage depot.",clamorous_owle,2025-04-22T08:01:06,3
"Rate cuts ok. The Fed can do what they want. The rubber hits the road at US 10 year treasury bonds. How’s that working out…….,",trastamara22,2025-04-22T20:07:31,1
"Sure, the two are pretty closely correlated. Typically the rate at which money is lent is above the rate at which it is borrowed. Since the time horizons are different, they are not perfectly correlated. But reasonably closely--if interest rates were back to the 2020 levels (close to zero), it would definitely put a downward pressure on the Treasury yields (and increase inflation).",hansn,2025-04-22T22:17:26,1
