">Secretary of State Marco Rubio rolled out the first stage of a major plan to reorganize the US State Department on Tuesday with changes that will eliminate 132 domestic offices, cut around 700 positions in Washington, DC and close offices focused on **war crimes and global conflict**, according to a senior State Department official and documents obtained by CNN.  JFC. I wonder why you would need to eliminate those offices.   >”Today is the day. Under @POTUS’ leadership and at my direction, we are reversing decades of bloat and bureaucracy at the State Department.   If they were truly cutting bloat Trump would be long gone.   >These sweeping changes will empower our talented diplomats to Put ~~America and Americans~~Trump and Trump ghouls first,” Rubio posted on X.",ChickpeaDemon,2025-04-22T13:01:35,2
