I used to volunteer with a crisis line for LGBTQ+ youth and the idea that a resource these kids desperately need could be cut is horrifying and devastating. I can’t even imagine being so vile that you’d willingly go after these kids who deserve love and support and the chance to grow up and be happy.,emslynn,2025-04-23T21:22:04,11

"I think the diminished care towards the youth of a nation is very common. They aren't babies and aren't voters so why should care say the politicians. Here in Australia, the fact that we don't have pill-testing at festivals, and allow the deaths of kids as the swarms of bootlicking police patrol with sniffer dogs shows that we just don't care.",Im_Talking,2025-04-23T21:40:13,4

"I can assure folks that a LOT of MAGATS are in favor of this.  Heck, they are in favor of having their own families die young (which they do, statistically) - the Harvard cuts and stuff like that are hurting ALS and Parkinson research (cures) and so on.  No matter what gets Reversed, damage is done. So some of us will watch family members and friends killed by disease that might have been mitigated without this POTUS.  That is the Trump style. He'd rather 10,000 extra people die than say he is sorry. AND, his followers are right there with him.",RosieDear,2025-04-23T21:12:44,7

"> It's not long until he starts suggesting sending them to camps.  Yup.  He's already rolled back an executive order Biden issued that prevented federal funds from being spent on conversion camps.   Once the Supreme Court rules on the state bans against such camps, I fully expect the Trump admin to start sending money to such camps, and even to start encouraging/demanding their use.",Cat_herder_81,2025-04-23T21:01:30,8

"Given that /pol/ ended up being a pro-Israel psyop on a massive scale, it would not surprise me if this was a huge conservative psyop to drive down Dem outreach efforts for resistance.

He called 911, but was too incoherent to tell me where he was.  I only had phase 1 location.  I had roughly 40 people trying to find this guy with only a phone number and the location of the cell phone tower his phone was using.   I got to listen to him fade away.

"With 4chan coming down, various places have posted IP addresses from /pol/ users that linked to a lot of users being from Israel. The info is dubious, but I think info that counters it is pretty dubious as well. Given disinfo campaigns now being increasingly murky, it's going to be up to each person's comfort level about whether or not they trust it.  As a Jewish person who does not trust Israel, I know antisemitism exists in this country, but I ABSOLUTELY think antisemitism is exploited by Israel because they don't give a shit about us in other countries. (Just like the US exploits concerns about terrorism and crime to deport and criminalize asylum seekers.)",Critical-Path-5959,2025-04-24T17:04:24,1
