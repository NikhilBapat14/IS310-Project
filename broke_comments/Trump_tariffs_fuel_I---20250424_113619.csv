Iowa farmers KNOW the subsidies are coming... Just a matter of time. They always get the money.,williamgman,2025-04-24T11:46:05,9
"Run up the score. Iowa voted twice for Obama then thrice for Trump. What they want is clear: conviction! Run someone who's forceful and unrelenting in their beliefs, someone who wants solutions, not hole-plugging patches and workarounds.",alabasterskim,2025-04-24T11:43:47,3
Promising to go after the monopolies in fertilizer and seeds would be a logical first step.  Another would be to go after Deere Software right to repair to farmers can get their equipment repaired on site and cheaper.,MentalTourniquet,2025-04-24T12:08:48,3
"For Iowa Democrats, it has been a difficult past several years.  The GOP took full control of the state’s congressional delegation after the 2022 election. The following year, the national party stripped the state of its first-in-the-nation status in the presidential nominating process. And in November, President Donald Trump carried Iowa by 13 percentage points, his largest margin of victory there through three elections.  But with two marquee statewide races — and a state economy that is especially rattled by Trump’s trade war — Iowa Democrats say they are sensing an opportunity to claw back into competition with Republicans.  Democrats are looking to seriously contest the newly open governor’s race, the U.S. Senate contest and most of the state’s U.S. House races next year, though the odds are squarely against them. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates the two statewide contests as “Solid Republican,” and Democrats last flipped a House seat in Iowa in 2018.

I believe nothing that WaPo publishes.,mokivj,2025-04-24T14:11:08,1
Iowa is a twisted state. Majority of Ag labor is undocumented and a ton of crop yields end up going abroad but the farmers absolutely rake it in on their exclusive taxpayer funded welfare that could never been afforded to someone who might also actually need it…,indycishun1996,2025-04-24T12:58:38,5

"To your point lawmaking on the federal level reached a level of gridlock where the public now sees ANY major action, however awful, as a good thing. It’s wild.",washu_z,2025-04-24T14:04:43,1
They only choose crops that get the subsidies. They truly are THE welfare queens (the equivalent of stereotype of making babies for welfare money).,williamgman,2025-04-24T13:06:09,5
The checks will literally have his signature on them. Just like he demanded it was put on the covid checks.,williamgman,2025-04-24T12:20:41,3
"I mean, yeah. I constantly attribute Trump's victory to that - his ideas were shitty but he had MAJOR shitty ones. So let's do good major actions instead of proposing just minor ones while they're proposing bad major ones. People want foundational change and Dems just keep proposing band aids that are gonna peel up and are still just as weak to Rs' constant fucking sabotage.",alabasterskim,2025-04-24T14:11:54,3
