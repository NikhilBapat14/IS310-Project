"Perry does remember that woman have already actually commanded space flights, right?",TheLimeyCanuck,2025-04-14T19:39:52,114
"This article sums it up nicely:  https://www.westernjournal.com/katy-perrys-post-flight-comments-perfectly-illustrate-farce-jeff-bezos-historic-female-crew/   Monday’s Blue Origin mission, touted as a historic all-female crew flight, was nothing more than a laughable spectacle.   Six women, including pop star Katy Perry, took a brief trip, barely reaching the edge of space.   This so-called milestone was the ultimate virtue-signaling stunt. It’s being celebrated as a ground-breaking achievement, but let’s be real: It was a glorified amusement park ride.   The New Shepard rocket, operated by mega-billionaire and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, carried the crew for a mere 10 minutes. The flight required no piloting, as the vehicle is fully autonomous, according to ABC News.   NBC News further added that these women crossed the Kármán line, 62 miles above Earth, but just barely. They experienced a few minutes of weightlessness before descending back to the ground.   And yet, we’re supposed to pretend this is a historic accomplishment? A 10-minute joyride doesn’t compare to the feats of true astronauts who’ve spent months (or more) in space.   The cherry on top was Perry’s claim of connecting to the “strong divine feminine.” This toxic feminist nonsense reeks of self-aggrandizement, not scientific achievement.   Let’s also not forget who’s behind this stunt: Jeff Bezos, the Amazon billionaire. Bezos should be embarrassed for orchestrating this wholly unserious spectacle under the guise of progress.",Ironman650,2025-04-14T21:40:18,99

I think they were in space for mere minutes. I’d love to do the same but I wouldn’t call it a real space flight.,skarface6,2025-04-15T07:29:48,-3
I would rather label them as cargo instead of “crew”,frkandelbroodje,2025-04-14T23:59:33,28
"This article sums up my thoughts exactly on this subject. They went above the atmosphere for a few minutes and came back down, and now they think they are on the same level as actual astronauts that spend days to months in space, not to mention the hard training they go through to get that opportunity. These girls just had a billionaire build them a rocket and go above the atmosphere for a few minutes and come back down and now think they changed the world some how.",Bud10,2025-04-15T00:13:18,5

"They passed the Kármán line, which is the official boundary of ""space"", so yes, by that standard it was a real space flight. That said it was a vanity mission being promoted as something groundbreaking, which it's not.",TheLimeyCanuck,2025-04-15T21:58:28,5
